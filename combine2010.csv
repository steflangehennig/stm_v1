        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, back to work.  The nation posts its largest job gain in three years, but unemployment remains unchanged at 9.7 percent. Are the millions of jobs lost during this recession ever coming back?  And what stimulus options does the administration have left?  Our exclusive guest this morning, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Christina Romer.
    "
1,"Then, the terror threat inside the U.S.  A new warning to the nation's governors surfaces as a violent anti-government plot is uncovered.  Plus, new airport screening rules in response to the Christmas Day bombing scare.  With us, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee,
Senator Joe Lieberman, Independent of Connecticut; a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, Congresswoman Jane Harman, Democrat of California; and former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff."
2,"Finally, the president's leadership.  Where does he stand after the healthcare debate?  And how will he lead his party in this election year? Insights from the editors:  New Yorker magazine editor and author of the new book ""The Bridge,"" David Remnick; and editor of Time magazine, author of the new book ""Mandela's Way,"" Rick Stengel."
3,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  But first, the economy.  The president welcomed the positive job growth numbers on Friday, saying the U.S. is ""beginning to turn the corner."" And with us live this morning, the chair of his Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Christina Romer."
4,Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
5,DR. CHRISTINA ROMER:  Great to be with you.
6,"MR. GREGORY:  So this was the very positive news, we'll put it up on the screen, 162,000 jobs that were created in the month of March.  Some of those temporary workers working on the census, and those who are sort of underemployed, as it's measured, takes that unemployment rate still higher. Yet, with those caveats, what did this mean?"
7,"DR. ROMER:  It meant we certainly had positive job growth.  I mean, even when you take out what you mentioned, which is the effect of the census workers--we had some 48,000 people hired by the census in March.  We also probably had a snow rebound effect.  We think the big storms pushed down the numbers in February and sort of artificially pushed them up in March.
But even taking those into account, we think we had good, solid, you know, employment growth. And that is, as the president said, it's the beginning."
8,MR. GREGORY:  The worst is over?
9,"DR. ROMER:  I think certainly we--I mean, we have been seeing gradually job losses moderate.  We've now crossed the zero line and are positive. Yes, I anticipate that we're going to continue to see positive job growth as we go forward, and what I'm going to be focusing on is how big does it get; because, as you mentioned in your opening, we've got a big hole when
it comes to jobs."
10,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, speaking of that, your colleague, the Treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, spoke to Matt Lauer on the ""Today"" program this week, and he said something that was striking.  Let's show it. "
11,"(Videotape, Thursday)"
12,"SEC'Y TIMOTHY GEITHNER:  The unemployment rate is still terribly high, and it's going to stay unacceptably high for a long period of time. "
13,(End videotape)
14,MR. GREGORY:  People will ask why and wonder whether we're dealing with a 21st century economy where significant job creation is not possible. 
15,"DR. ROMER:  Oh, I think that's, that's certainly not true.  I--obviously, I absolutely think that we will be creating a lot of jobs.  You know, the fact that the unemployment rate stayed constant this month at some level is pretty amazing, because we have seen..."
16,MR. GREGORY:  Nine point seven percent.
17,"DR. ROMER:  Nine point seven percent, which is, as Secretary Geithner said, absolutely unacceptable.  But, you know, behind that there's just been a tremendous increase in the labor force.  For the last three months, or over the last three months, we've added more than a million people to the labor force.  And that's actually--that's a great sign. That's a sign that people that might have been discouraged, dropped out because of the terrible recession have started to have some hope again and are looking for work again."
18,MR. GREGORY:  But why will it be so high for so long?
19,"DR. ROMER:  Well, I think part of it is we still face a lot of headwinds. I mean, this recession has been, as I've said, you know, an absolutely terrible one.  It's also an unusual one, having been caused by a financial crisis, has created a lot of fear.  That's a lot of--you know,
we still have some trouble with debt and credit availability.  All of that makes it harder for us to grow, so most of the forecasts are we'll grow about 3 percent real GDP in, in 2010.  That's not enough to get a lot of job growth.  We'll get positive job growth, it'll be enough to probably bring the unemployment rate down a little bit, but you need faster than that to really make a dent."
20,"MR. GREGORY:  Members of the president's own party, congressmen and women at hearings recently, have raised some, some real concerns about this, the priority that jobs has and job creation has within the administration.  This was one such complaint aired at a hearing where you were present.  We'll show it now."
21,"(Videotape, March 16, 2010)"
22,"REP. MARCY KAPTUR (D-OH):  I find your testimony dismaying and out of touch. And I ask myself, how can we be so far apart in our views?  ... Your testimony doesn't even mention the total number of unemployed and underemployed and marginally attacked in our country.  That number, for your information, is 25 million people.  ...  People aren't working.  On page three, astoundingly, you concede unemployment won't go down.  You have no urgency."
23,(End videotape)
24,MR. GREGORY:  So the question becomes what options does the president have left to try to spur job creation?
25,"DR. ROMER:  Well, first thing I want to say is we have tremendous urgency.  I mean, if you think about what we've done over the last year, the president has always made it clear jobs was number one.  And that's why within a month of when he came into office he passed the biggest fiscal stimulus in American history.  We've done repeated things--the Cash for Clunkers, extending the first-time home buyers credit.  And starting last fall, the president was talking about additional things that we can do.  We just did one of them.  The HIRE Act that was signed a couple of weeks ago had one of the things I think can be very effective, which is a tax incentive for hiring.  I'm very optimistic that that's sort of the right policy for this stage in the recovery.  We see firms starting to hire temporary workers, we see demand coming back.  We think this might be something that will help to push them over.  But the president has emphasized small business lending.  There are programs pending in Congress that we've proposed, a $30 billion small business lending program that we think we--could be very important.  We've supported zero capital gains tax for people that invest in small businesses.  We think that's a good policy that could help to start new firms, get job creation that way."
26,MR. GREGORY:  What about an energy jobs bill?  Will that be a priority for Democrats in Congress? 
27,"DR. ROMER:  Absolutely.  I mean, the president, you know, starting with the Recovery Act, has wanted to--thinks that investing in clean energy is a smart way to create jobs now, make us a healthier economy in the future.  We have a program for encouraging energy retrofits, sort of an energy version of Cash for Clunkers, we think could be very effective."
28,"I also want to mention, you know, before Congress left, they failed to extend the unemployment insurance provisions of the Recovery Act.  That absolutely has to get done.  The numbers we see, the 9.7 percent unemployment, we've got to be supporting those workers.  And by supporting them, we support the whole economy."
29,"MR. GREGORY:  You mentioned the stimulus as a huge effort by this administration to deal with people who are out of work and to deal with a recession.  And yet, again, I go back to members of the president's own party raising concerns about just how effective it's been.  We see in polling that people are still not feeling it, that they--that it's still not very popular. And The New Yorker reported something recently quoting a Democrat from Virginia about the stimulus, saying this:  ""We should have gone in and done the kind of stimulus that would actually turn the economy around.  We ended up with something that was strong enough to
prevent a depression.  But it just wasn't strong enough to stimulate the recovery."" Would you concede that it didn't do as much as you thought it would have done to spark recovery?"
30,DR. ROMER:  Absolutely not.  I think it has done exactly what we said it would do.  And I think the...
31,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, clearly, it didn't do what you said it would do, which is to keep unemployment at 8 percent."
32,"DR. ROMER:  What we had said it would do would to, to save or create some three and a half million jobs.  It's absolutely on track to do that.  I also think it's a big part--be--the reason we've seen, as the president said, we've--beginning to turn the corner.  I think experts across the ideological spectrum give the Recovery Act a lot of credit for the dramatic change in the trajectory that, that we have seen.  It has, you know, it has absolutely supported unemployed workers, it has absolutely helped state and local governments.  And we are investing in this country in a way that is helping to create jobs and making us more productive in the future."
33,"MR. GREGORY:  On the issue of job creation, I've spoken to some business leaders who say, you know, ""Look at the healthcare debate.  Look how rancorous it was.  Look how much uncertainty there is even about the outcome of, of health care's impact down the road."" Look at all the talk about regulation and what some people see as an anti-business climate in
Washington generally and the administration specifically.  If you're a small or a large business, why would you build a factory today?  Why would you start hiring workers?"
34,"DR. ROMER:  I think you'd build a factory because we see the economy starting to grow again, and I think there are going to be profit opportunities."
35,"But I've got to come back to health care.  First, we've gotten a lot of certainty because the bill has finally passed, and I think that's a fabulous development.  But also, it is such a pro-business bill, especially pro-small business.  It has been designed precisely to do what small business owners tell us they want to do, which is provide health insurance for their workers. They think it gives them a competitive advantage to be able to offer that. And this bill has designed--it has some $40 billion of tax credits for small businesses.  It exempts them from any employer responsibility fees.  It gives them an insurance exchange where they can get insurance for their workers at a cheaper price.  So it is a big win for business."
36,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But, Dr. Romer, there are also people who say it doesn't do the number one thing that many people feel it should have done, which is really attack costs that are out of control.  And here's one anecdote I heard, that if you are cutting back on reimbursements to providers or, say, hospitals through Medicare, that those costs don't just go away, they get shifted so that employees of companies will pay higher prices for other tests in hospitals, and ultimately that price inflation that companies, small and large, have to deal with is still
very much there despite the fact that this bill is law."
37,"DR. ROMER:  I think that's completely wrong, and I'd ask you to read the Congressional Budget Office's own report where they say for both small and large businesses it will lower their health insurance premiums."
38,MR. GREGORY:  You don't think costs are going to be shifted by hospitals that get fewer reimbursements through Medicare?  You don't think they're going to pass that cost on?
39,"DR. ROMER:  I think, overall, this bill is genuinely going to slow the growth rate of cost.  You know, we did a study, we think it will genuinely slow the growth rate of cost by about 1 percentage point per year.  And, again, that is what experts across the ideological spectrum
are saying.  You know, we did a comparison of what was in the CBO report for more than a year ago of game-changers, the things that would slow the growth rate of cost.  Almost every one of those ended up in this bill."
40,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to ask you about a phenomenon that people are talking about this weekend that has to do with consumers, and that's Apple's new product, the iPad.  There's lines around the country of people, you know, commerce in action, right?  People are buying these products.  But it leads to a question as to whether you think, as an economist, that consumers can actually drive a recovery that is sustained."
41,"DR. ROMER:  You know, I think this is going to be a different kind of recovery.  I think it's not going to be one where consumers come roaring back as the engine of growth.  They have been through a very rough two years, they've seen their house prices come down.  So we--you know, we see solid consumer growth, it's definitely coming back.  Their confidence is back up. But this is not going to be a recovery that's fueled by people going out, maxing out their credit cards again.  I think we've been, you know, I think we're in a different world.  It's going to need to come from our exports, that's why the president's been pushing his export initiative.  It's going to need to come from business investment, and that's why measures like a zero capital gains for small businesses or tax incentives for investment, I think those are the right policy to make sure we get a healthy kind of growth going forward."
42,"MR. GREGORY:  Before I let you go, a couple of other important topics. One, financial regulation, the new rules of the road for Wall Street.  Do you think a bill will be successful this year since you've suffered some setbacks with Republicans starting to, to back away from support of it?"
43,"DR. ROMER:  I think--yes, I think it will.  I think, think it has to.  I think people from both parties realize that we do need some sensible rules for the road because we don't ever want to go through this again. I think we're very confident that we'll be able to pick up some
Republican support."
44,"MR. GREGORY:  Also, China.  Will this administration take China on and accuse it outright of manipulating its currency in a way that hurts the U.S. exports but also costs us jobs?"
45,"DR. ROMER:  I mean, it--certainly the exchange rate is an issue, not just for the United States, but for Chinese consumers and for actually other countries. A lot of other emerging market economies say that what's happening with China's exchange rate is, is harmful to them.  You know, we have a series of meetings over the next three months with both the president, the secretary of the Treasury, and this is absolutely going to be an issue that's high on the agenda."
46,MR. GREGORY:  Is China manipulating its currency? 
47,"DR. ROMER:  You know, I think that's going to be s omething that, that the secretary of the Treasury would, would speak on, but we're going to absolutely..."
48,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but as a matter of substance, can't you just say yes or no?  Why can't you say whether--I mean, it either is or it's not."
49,"DR. ROMER:  You know, we think it needs to be more influenced by market forces. I think there's no question of that.  The secretary of the Treasury and the president have both said that.  We're going to be working to, to get the kind of result that we want, which is something
more in alignment."
50,"MR. GREGORY:  Finally, a political question, and I know you're not involved in the politics, and yet, you know, politicians will campaign on promises and facts, and a lot of times they might have to turn to the economists and say, ""Is this a fair thing to be campaigning on?"" Should Democrats be campaigning this fall, taking some credit for turning the economy around?"
51,"DR. ROMER:  Unquestionably.  I think the policies that have been put in place, they were tough decisions on everything from the Recovery Act to the stress test, to the financial rescue.  Every one of those was absolutely essential, and it's the reason we are in a much more hopeful
place today than we were a year ago.  So I think they should be out there very strongly saying that they made the tough choices and we're starting to see the benefits."
52,"MR. GREGORY:  Dr. Romer, happy Easter, thank you very much for being here."
53,DR. ROMER:  Same to you.
54,"MR. GREGORY:  And up next, the terror threat.  New airport screening rules and the growing threats lurking inside this country.  Our guests: former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff; the Senate's Homeland Security Committee chair, Senator Joe Lieberman; and a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, Congressman--Congresswoman Jane Harman."
55,"Then the question of presidential leadership in the political landscape for 2010.  Insights from two magazine editors and authors of the newly published books, The New Yorker's David Remnick and Time magazine's Rick Stengel, only here on MEET THE PRESS."
56,(Announcements)
57,"MR. GREGORY:  The terror threat, a look at our security both at home and abroad, after this brief commercial break."
58,(Announcements)
59,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We are back here on MEET THE PRESS where we will have a discussion coming up on President Obama and the politics of 2010 with our roundtable; that's in a few minutes.  But first, a closer look at security both here and abroad with the former secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, and two key members of Congress, Representative Jane Harman and Senator Joe Lieberman. Congresswoman Harman also on the Intelligence Subcommittee of the Homeland Security Committee."
60,"So a few things we want to address, including some developing news from earlier today.  In Baghdad, suicide bombers have struck.  Some 30 dead after attacks on several embassies--the Egyptian, Iranian, and German embassies in central Baghdad."
61,"And, Senator Lieberman, a reminder as the U.S. prepares to disengage its combat troops from Iraq.  And after an election where there's still a very shaky coalition about the way forward, what concerns you seeing this?"
62,"SEN. JOE LIEBERMAN (I-CT):  Well, I think you, you've got to look at the good news first.  There, there was an election there, the, the secular parties, the, the parties that Iran didn't want to succeed did better than the other parties.  So there's a lot of good news happening in Iraq. I, I think what you've got to see these bombings as is a desperate attempt by the people who don't want a unified Iraq that's independent of Iran and self-governing and self-protecting to take hold."
63,"But it is a warning to us.  We're on a path now, which is an extraordinary positive path, to, to bring down our troop levels to 50,000 by September 1st. There were up way into 150,000, 160,000 not so long ago.  But we've got to do it methodically and make sure that the Iraqis
can protect themselves and all that they've gained as a result of all that we've helped them do in the last few years.  So, you know, this is not over, but tremendous progress militarily, politically, economically is being made in Iraq today."
64,"MR. GREGORY:  And, and, Congresswoman, this question of capacity for the new government in terms of securing the country is one that still is going to be asked again and again, not only when there's political instability, but when you see events like this."
65,"REP. JANE HARMAN (D-CA):  That's true.  But I agree with Joe Lieberman that this is basically a success story, and I applaud the Obama government for withdrawing our troops on a reasonable schedule, which I think tells the Iraqis that they have to manage their future.  That's a message we need to send, by the way, to the, the folks in Afghanistan as well, where I'm very troubled by the comments of Hamid Karzai in the last several days."
66,"MR. GREGORY:  And we'll get--we're going to get to that in a few minutes. I want to talk about the terror threat from abroad, though, and bring in Secretary Chertoff here about these new screening rules that just came about on Friday where individuals coming from other countries are going to be evaluated a little bit differently.  And The New York Times kind of summarized how the intelligence will be used in order to identify people who need additional screenings.  This is how the Times reported it.  ""The intelligence-based security system is devised to raise flags about travelers whose names do not appear on a no-fly watch list,"" which was the issue on the Christmas Day plot, ""but whose travel patterns or personal traits create suspicions.  The system is intended to pick up fragments of information - family name, nationality, age or even partial passport number - and match them against intelligence reports to sound alarm bells before a passenger boards a plane."""
67,"Secretary Chertoff, I should just point out in full disclosure, you now work for companies in homeland security area that are producing some of the homeland security technology that may be brought to bear.  That said, what's the impact of these new rules?"
68,"MR. MICHAEL CHERTOFF:  What this basically does, David, is it takes a technique that we have used at the border for the last two or three years, and it pushes it out so that it will be applied not when people arrive in the U.S. but when people board planes overseas.  So it's a good thing.  We have a lot of experience using this kind of information.  It has worked exceptionally well when people arrive at the airport.  And so the idea of pushing it out before people board makes a lot of sense.  The critical issue here is will our allies and other countries overseas be
willing to implement the plan the way we have laid it out?  If they are willing to do that, it will be a win-win for everybody. "
69,"MR. GREGORY:  So you've got to be able to share intelligence with foreign governments to sort of factor in to a kind of matrix so that you're not just profiling somebody based on where they're from, but based on certain red flags in the system that say, ""Hey, I better, I better correlate this""?"
70,"REP. HARMAN:  If I could add to that, after the Christmas bomb plot, we, I think, in linear fashion, targeted 14 countries and said everyone coming here from those 14 countries will get secondary screening.  I think that that was a message to those countries that was the wrong
message.  Janet Napolitano, our Homeland Security secretary, who has very ably succeeded the able Michael Chertoff, has traveled extensively to foreign governments, and I think this plan was worked out with them; and it is an intelligence-based screening system rather than a name based screening system.  We are adding to our no-fly list and our secondary list.  But this is the way we will capture folks who don't fit that--the, the stereotype of a Muslim male between 20 and 40. "
71,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
72,"REP. HARMAN:  Let's understand that terrorists come in all shapes and sizes, and they're not even all Muslim.  I resent the fact, by the way, that Jihad Jane took my name.  It wasn't her given name.  But that's my point.  They come in the U.S., and they're all over the world."
73,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
74,"REP. HARMAN:  And it seems to me that, going forward, we're going to be doing something much more effective."
75,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Lieberman, let me ask you about another big headline this week, and that was the horror in Russia with those railroad--railway attacks carried out by extremist terrorist groups.  And it was something that obviously would reverberate here back in the U.S.
The cover of the New York Post showing an increased police presence on New York subways as a response to that.  And the president talked a little bit about what the government is doing to head off a kind of railway attack when he appeared on the ""Today"" program this week."
76,"(Videotape, Tuesday)"
77,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  We have been on top of the issue of rail security and subway security for quite some time.  We constantly monitor it and try to figure out how can we improve what we're doing.  It is obviously a significant concern.  It's not restricted to subways.  It's--you know, same thing could happen at a bus terminal.  And if you've got somebody who is determined to kill themselves and kill other people with them, that is always a challenge for any government."
78,(End videotape)
79,"MR. GREGORY:  What's the nature of the threat, Senator, here in America?"
80,"SEN. LIEBERMAN:  The, the threat is real to, to non-aviation transportation. Look, all you got to do is look around the world, not only to the terrible tragedy in Russia last week, but remember the train bombings in London and, and Madrid and earlier in Mumbai.  So these are
targets.  And, and we know that, and we're doing a lot, our government is, working with state and local officials to--both in ways that are visible and ways that are not visible--to raise our defenses on trains and subways and buses.  But, David, to me, and I've--we, we, in our committee, we've done hearings on this, and I continue to believe that this, that, that non-aviation is the vulnerable part of our transportation system, and we, frankly, need to give it more than we're giving it now to protect the American people.  I worry about this."
81,"MR. GREGORY:  Secretary Chertoff, I want to get to some domestic terror concerns.  Before I do that, I want to talk about another element of terrorism.  Before you were secretary of Homeland Security, you were head of the criminal division in the Justice Department."
82,MR. CHERTOFF:  Yeah.
83,"MR. GREGORY:  And so this issue of civilian trials for terror suspects is one that you're quite familiar with.  Now, clearly, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of 9/11, is not going to be tried in New York.  It likes he's going to be tried in a military tribunal.  The question is where, whether it's Guantanamo Bay or not.  Now, you actually fought, correct me if I'm wrong, to have Zacarias Moussaoui tried in civilian court."
84,MR. CHERTOFF:  Right.
85,MR. GREGORY:  He was thought to be the 20th hijacker.
86,MR. CHERTOFF:  Mm-hmm.
87,MR. GREGORY:  Where do you come down on what the administration ought to be doing next?
88,"MR. CHERTOFF:  You know, generally, of course, our--my overall approach is use all the tools.  Everything should be on the table for every circumstance. That being said, the general approach we took when I was head of criminal was, if someone was caught in the U.S., at the end of the day, they wound up being tried in a U.S. court for a whole lot of practical and legal reasons, including the fact that it's easy to get the evidence if someone's acting in the United States itself.  It doesn't mean you have to give them Miranda warnings, but it does mean you could put them ultimately through the system. Generally, the view was if someone was caught overseas and they weren't an American, we didn't bring them into a U.S. court because there are huge obstacles to gathering evidence and some of the process issues when you apprehend someone in a battlefield.  So, without laying down an ironclad rule, my general approach is catch them here, try them here, catch them overseas, put them in a military commission."
89,MR. GREGORY:  So you think its OK to have them in a civilian court?
90,"MR. CHERTOFF:  To, to put who in a civilian court?"
91,MR. GREGORY:  Like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
92,"MR. CHERTOFF:  I, I would, I would advise against it, frankly.  I think that the evidence collection issues and some of the legal issues you'll find..."
93,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
94,"MR. CHERTOFF:  ...even picking a jury, if you're going to set this up in a military base, will be very problematic.  So I, I, I think it's a very, very difficult way to go to take him into a civilian court."
95,MR. GREGORY:  Congresswoman?
96,"REP. HARMAN:  I think our federal court system has been the linchpin of our ability to convict people charged with terrorism-related crimes since 9/11. Over 500 people have been charged, over 300 have pleaded guilty, and they're all safely behind bars for life.  And I think that if KSM
were tried in a federal court, I would predict he would be convicted and possibly executed."
97,"MR. GREGORY:  What--if, if you stand behind our, our system of law in this country, then why did the attorney general go out there and say he would never be released even if he were acquitted.  Is that standing up for United States jurisprudence?"
98,"REP. HARMAN:  Well, my view is that everyone still at Gitmo, there are 183 people, should be tried either in U.S. courts, including military commissions, if that, for some reason, is if we revise the procedures there and they can withstand legal challenge, or tried abroad and incarcerated.  I don't think that we should waive the rule of law for anybody.  And I don't think that preventive detention is necessary in the United States of America."
99,"MR. GREGORY:  OK.  I want, I want to move on because I want to get to some domestic security threats.  Senator Lieberman..."
100,"SEN. LIEBERMAN:  David, I want..."
101,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator, yes, Senator Lieberman?  You just want to get..."
102,SEN. LIEBERMAN:  I just want to get in here real quickly.
103,MR. GREGORY:  You want to get on this?  Go ahead.
104,"SEN. LIEBERMAN:  Yeah, real, real quickly.  Look, we're at war.  We were attacked on 9/11.  And I think when you're at war, even though this is a different kind of war, people you capture, enemies who are aiming to attack you or have, in fact, attacked you, ought to be tried according to the rules of war.  It's not that we're not going to have the rule of law, it's which rule of law.  And so I think that the Christmas Day bomber, Hasan at Fort Hood, they're as much enemies of ours and soldiers in the war of Islamist extremism against us as the people we capture and, and put into prisoner of war camps in Afghanistan or Iraq."
105,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  I want to...
106,SEN. LIEBERMAN:  And we make a mistake when we don't do that.
107,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to--this, this debate will continue and--certainly until the president makes a decision..."
108,SEN. LIEBERMAN:  Right.
109,MR. GREGORY:  ...on what's going to happen with KSM.
110,"I want to turn to the domestic threat.  And there's been a lot of developments about this more recently, including this Christian militia, the Hutatree***(as spoken)***militia in Michigan facing charges of a violent plot to overthrow the government.  This is from their Web site, where they showed some training. Mike Isikoff writes in Newsweek's blog  about the conditions under which this is happening.  ""In some respects, the increase in such violent hate groups as the Hutaree appears reminiscent of the surge in militia activity that preceded the '95 Oklahoma City bombing.  Just this month, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported that it had tracked an explosion in extremist, anti-government `Patriot' groups, fueled in large part by anger over the economy and Barack Obama's presidency.  The number identifiable Patriot groups increased 244 percent, from 149 in 2008 to 512 in 2009."""
111,"Senator Lieberman, back to you.  In this highly charged political atmosphere, where you've got so much passion, so much disagreement, this takes it, of course, to a different level.  But we're also operating in a recession and at a time where there's a lot of anger at Washington.  How has the nature of that threat escalated, in your view?"
112,"SEN. LIEBERMAN:  Well, the threat has definitely escalated.  And all the conditions that you mentioned, David, are there to encourage people. Look, I would say a word of caution to my colleagues in both political parties and, frankly, in the media.  The level of discourse about our
politics and about our country are so extreme and so incendiary that if you're dealing with people who may, may not be clicking on all cylinders and, and may have vulnerabilities personally, there's a danger that they're going to do what this group of militia planned to do this week. I would not overstate this threat.  It is not as significant as the global threat of Islamist extremism, but it is real.  And I want to assure the American people, from where I sit as the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, that your government is taking this militia threat very seriously.  The FBI is on top of this. That's why, through good work and informants, they stopped this Hutaree group before they had a chance to do what they wanted to do, which is to attack law enforcement officers, to try to..."
113,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
114,SEN. LIEBERMAN:  ...break down authority in our country.
115,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  And you had a--Congresswoman, you also had a threat to, to governors as well, you know, a letter telling them that they needed to step down."
116,"REP. HARMAN:  That's right.  But the other troubling thing about this is that group was going to import the terror tactics used by al-Qaeda and other groups.  They were going to use IEDs to blow up the funeral procession for these law enforcement officers that they were going to execute.  Let's understand that law enforcement does a wonderful job of keeping this country safe, and without the women and men of law enforcement, who kept our Capitol safe during the protests on, on health care, I think we'd be in much worse trouble.  But the point is that not all terror groups are Muslim groups, and not all of them are al-Qaeda-related.  This is a global problem; and, domestically, we have a growing problem of homegrown terrorism, not just from Muslims."
117,"MR. GREGORY:  Secretary Chertoff, you've seen this from, from your position before.  I mean, look, there are certainly quarters of, you know, of racism around the country with an African-American president, extreme economic anxiety, and a lot of revolution talk out there in this
opposition to policies like health care.  And, you know, people may forget, if you go back to the Oklahoma City bombings, Tim McVeigh first went to Waco not to protest the government's role there, but to protest the Brady gun law.  So this notion of the government doing things to you is a very powerful motivator to some."
118,"MR. CHERTOFF:  Well, you know, you always get fringe groups on both sides of the spectrum, going back, as you say, to Waco and Ruby Ridge in the early '90s, and that culminated, of course, in the Oklahoma City bombing. And then that depressed this a little bit.  But it always lurks in the background.  And we see it also with some of the extreme anti-globalization and animal rights people on the left.  So I think we've learned how to manage this.  I agree with Senator Lieberman, this is not of the order of magnitude of what we see with global terrorism.
But, look, the fact that people can get on the Internet, and they can see the tactics that are being used in Iraq and Afghanistan creates a risk that those will be copycatted here.  And, frankly, we've seen that in Mexico.  In northern Mexico, the criminal groups, which are not 
politically motivated, actually have adopted beheadings and other tactics of terrorism as part of pushing their agenda against President Calderon. "
119,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, before I let everybody go, a couple of quick, you know, foreign policy notes that are most pressing."
120,"Senator Lieberman, you've heard the president say this week that he would like to see sanctions against Iran within weeks.  But that's still been very--a very difficult road.  Do you worry that the U.S. and the West, more generally, is drifting toward war with Iran in some fashion?"
121,"SEN. LIEBERMAN:  Well, I appreciated the president's statement.  And I'll tell you the truth, I worry more that we're not going to do enough to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon quickly enough.  I, I believe we're at a turning point in history.  Iran with nuclear weapons is going to mean this world will be a lot less safe than it is today, and there are already threats to our safety every day.  We've never--this is an extremist, expansionist power.  There's never been another country like this with nuclear weapons, and we've got to impose tough sanctions
quickly.  I believe Congress will adopt a tough sanctions bill soon, I hope this month of April."
122,"Secondly, they've got to be tough because, frankly, it's the last chance that we're giving Iran and ourselves not to be left with a choice of either accepting them having nuclear weapons or taking military action. In my opinion, we have to be prepared to take military action to stop the
Iranian nuclear program if they refuse to stop themselves."
123,MR. GREGORY:  Congresswoman...
124,"SEN. LIEBERMAN:  And so far, if you look at the last three or four years, we've had threats, we've had engagement, we've had negotiations; and all the while Iran keeps going forward to build a nuclear weapon and the missiles to deliver them, and that will destabilize..."
125,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
126,"SEN. LIEBERMAN:  ...the entire Middle East, threaten Europe and America."
127,"REP. HARMAN:  This past week I was in Yemen, Qatar and Vienna, where we have a new very strong head of the IAEA, a Japanese man named Amano, who has what he calls a more balanced view and has major concerns about Iran. Why am I saying this?  I think the real test will be what the U.N. will do.  And I think it's good news that Chinese Premier Hu is coming here in two weeks to a terrorism summit with 45 countries, and hopefully that will be a chance for him and President Obama to talk about the U.N., where China and Russia support for multilateral sanctions is key. Congress is on board with strong, debilitating sanctions on a bipartisan basis.  The U.S. will be there.  But it has to be multilateral in order to really be truly debilitating.  And that's what we need to do."
128,"But, by the way, Yemen is now ground zero, in my view, for terror attacks against us.  Al-Awlaki, who is an American-Yemeni who had a role in counseling the Fort Hood shooter and also was involved in training Abdulmutallab, the Christmas bomber, is at large in Yemen.  He's targeted by the Yemenis, they're in lead, but we're helping.  And it will be very good news if we're able to take him out and the al-Qaeda presence in Yemen."
129,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, I'm going to, I'm going to leave it there.  I'll make that the last word.  Thank you all very much."
130,"Coming up next, presidential leadership.  Where does Obama stand after the healthcare debate, and how will he lead his party in this election year? Insights from The New Yorker magazine's David Remnick, author of ""The Bridge,"" and Time magazine's Rick Stengel, author of ""Mandela's Way,"" after this brief station break."
131,(Announcements)
132,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We are back with our roundtable this morning, joined by the editors, New Yorker's David Remnick, the author of ""The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama,"" as well as Time magazine's Rick Stengel, the author of ""Mandela's Way:  Fifteen Lessons on Life, Love, and Courage."""
133,"Welcome, both of you.  Interesting opportunity to talk about the president's leadership at this stage and where he stands.  Let's look at his approval ratings as he comes out of this healthcare debate, as measured by Gallup:  47 percent approval, 50 percent approval--or
disapproval, I should say.  This has been a pretty tough debate that he's come through, but he has achieved on health care.  Where is he right now, David?"
134,"MR. DAVID REMNICK:  Well, anytime you have 10 percent unemployment, you're not going to have soaring approval.  Anytime the, the economy is troubled in many areas, you're not going to have soaring approval ratings, despite the personal popularity of Barack Obama.  So I think,
you know, he, he's in--he's, he's not in trouble, but he's not going to be able to lift all Democratic votes in November.  It's going, it's going to be a tough road in November."
135,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet you talk about, Rick, you talk about achievement in the first term.  You go back to July of 2008, a Rolling Stone interview that he gave about what would be the marker, the metric for success for a President Obama.  The question was just that, what would the marker that you would lay down be at the end of your first term where you say if this has happened or not happened, I would consider it a negative mark on my governance?  He says, ""If I haven't gotten combat troops out of Iraq, passed universal healthcare insurance, and created a new energy policy that speaks to our dependence on foreign oil and deals seriously with global warming, then we've missed the boat."" He's on a course to significantly achieve at least a couple of those items."
136,"MR. RICK STENGEL:  Right.  He's ringing the bell.  I mean, a couple of weeks ago, remember, he was going to be Jimmy Carter, right, and then health care passed..."
137,MR. REMNICK:  Mm-hmm.
138,"MR. STENGEL:  ...and suddenly he's revitalized.  But he has a whole line of things that he wants to do, including financial deregulation, energy policy. I mean, he could go and, and swing and run around the bases this whole first year.  And, and basically he said, ""Look, you know what, this is what I said I was going to do, I did it, and now vote for me."""
139,"MR. GREGORY:  The, the flip side of accomplishment--I mean obviously presidents come here to accomplish things; but, ultimately, the--taking the measure of him as a leader, is something obviously you've done in the course of the work on the book.  What have we learned about Barack Obama as president that is informed by his ascent?"
140,"MR. REMNICK:  Well, we've learned what--his political patterns have always been clear.  He's a man of the center left, but a deep pragmatist, and his, his style is conciliation, his style is to put his arms around as many people as possible and try to bring them into a compromise.  We
saw that at its apogee in the healthcare situation.  But the question is, will it apply in some of these other big questions that you raise, like, like nuclear Iran?  I don't think putting your arms around Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is going to work, and he's got to get the U.N. on board. Take global warming.  That's a situation that imperils us all in a very serious way, despite the science deniers.  And we have to get international cooperation on an unprecedented level in order to take the measures that are necessary to reverse global warming.  No single leader
can do that either.  It's going to take a lot of effort and, and a lot of conciliation with other leaders around the world."
141,"MR. GREGORY:  And it's interesting, Rick, Joe Klein, in Time magazine in the last couple of weeks, has said even as we look at the success of health care, we shouldn't minimize some of the shortcomings of his leadership that were in evidence in the course of that very difficult
debate."
142,"MR. STENGEL:  Yes.  Look, a lot of people felt, a lot of voters felt that he took his eye off the ball, which was the economy.  Remember, 80 percent of American voters who have health care like it.  We almost had a financial Armageddon.  The stimulus program helped avert that, but 
remember when voters go to the polls what do they care about?  They care about the economy, they care about the economy, they care about the economy.  Jobs and the economy are the main thing on people's minds.  So I think now he's got to pivot and basically say, ""What I am about for the next year is the economy.  The economy is changing.  It ain't going to come back exactly like it was before.  We're going to have to start saving, we're going to have to start exporting."" And that will be his message.  But it will mainly be a rhetorical message because there's a limit--I mean, Dr. Romer was, was, was trying to defend this--there's a limit to what the government can do to actually create jobs. You know, they're creating 800,000 of them, by the way, with the census, but that goes away in a few months."
143,"MR. GREGORY:  Here's a question about his style of leadership.  To say that President Obama is not an inspirational figure would strike a lot of people, especially defenders, as almost heresy.  But my question is, has he found a way to reach people's hearts when it's not about him and his historic journey, when it's about them and their struggles?"
144,"MR. REMNICK:  Well, I, I, I don't want to get too gooey about this.  He's a president.  You know, he's not--that's what he--he's a politician. He's, he's out to make policy advances, policy victories.  He does not have the same talents as Ronald Reagan, he doesn't have the same talents as FDR. He is himself.  And there's a certain coolness to his affect.  I think a lot of foreign leaders wonder why he's not in closer touch with them.  Where is the love, some, some of the Israelis certainly think in the last couple of weeks..."
145,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
146,"MR. REMNICK:  ...have--and they've been struck by his reticence, his personal reticence.  But the question is, what can he achieve?  What, what are the major victories he can bring?  And he just had a really historic victory, we shouldn't forget, on health care, despite the limitations of the bill itself."
147,"MR. GREGORY:  I thought it was interesting, too, in terms of a political matter, Rick, how he deals with this phenomenon of the tea party movement, which Republicans are trying to figure out, Democrats are trying to figure out.  Here's a portion of what he said to Matt Lauer during the course of his interview about that."
148,"(Videotape, Tuesday)"
149,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  I wouldn't paint in broad brush and say that, you know, everybody's whos involved or, or have gone to a tea party rally or a meeting are somehow on the fringe.  Some of them, I think, have some mainstream legitimate concerns.  And, you know, my hope is, is that as we move forward and we're tackling things like the deficit and imposing a freeze on domestic spending and taking steps that show we're sincere about dealing with our long-term problems that some of that group will dissipate."
150,(End videotape)
151,"MR. GREGORY:  How does he try to make sense of this politically, of this movement that could hurt?"
152,"MR. STENGEL:  I think it's hard.  You know, there's that great famous American bumper sticker, ""I love my country, but I fear my government."" That's what tea partiers are about.  It's--they're mainly Republicans, but there's this disenchantment in the land with government as a whole. The USA Today/Gallup poll the other day showed three-quarters of Americans are basically disenchanted with governmental institutions. They are plucking people from that.  But the issue for Republicans and for Democrats, and for, and for Barack Obama in particular, is how do you lure back those independents?  More and more people are identifying themselves as independents, and how do I, how do I bring them back in? And, and even to go back to your previous question, I mean, remember, you know, Mario Cuomo famously said, you know, ""We, we campaign in poetry and we govern in prose."" He's got to govern with a little bit more poetry, I think, to get some of those folks, too. "
153,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to talk a little bit about his ascent, his ambition, how we understand that and how that's playing out in his presidency thus far."
154,"And, David, your book deals with something that's very central, which is that for Barack Obama to become sort of well-situated as a man and ultimately as a political leader he had to work out his own racial identity and sort of come to terms with that.  And here's a portion where you talk about identity in the book, racial identity.  You write this: ""Even before he announced his candidacy, Obama was selective in talking about race.  As the only African-American in the Senate, it would have been natural for him to be the most constant voice on `black issues': structural inequality, affirmative action, poverty, drug laws.  But he was determined to be an individual with a black identity but a politician with a broad outlook and purpose."""
155,"MR. REMNICK:  And that, and that maintains even now.  You know, I had an interview with him in the Oval Office right before he was going, going to deliver his inaugural address, and we finished our interview and then he came out into the hallway and he wanted to add something very specific, because we'd been talking about race quite a lot.  And he said, ""Look, it's just not worth it for me to talk about race when I have to extemporize, when I have to improvise"" as he did with Henry Louis Gates Jr.  when--that arrest, that arrest drama.  When he's in control of the subject, when he can give a whole speech as he did in Philadelphia during the campaign, and he can get to all the nuances, he will talk about it. But basically he believes, ""Look, I'm the president of the United States. I'm not president of black America.  And I have to lift all boats,"" in, in Kennedy's terms, in terms of economic improvement.  ""I can't just focus my rhetoric or focus my policies on, on any one ethnic group."" And this has caused some problems with some of this former supporters and even supporters now."
156,"MR. GREGORY:  It's interesting, we actually found something from 1990, Rick, where he was elected to president of Harvard Law Review, which is very prestigious, and he gets a lot of pickup in that as, as you write about in the book.  The Associated Press has an interview with him, and this is what he says.  ""`Hopefully, more and more people will begin to feel their story is somehow part of this larger story of how we're going to reshape America in a way that is less mean-spirited and more generous,' Obama said."" Remember this is 20 years ago almost to the week. ""`I mean, I really hope to be part of a transformation of this country.' And the future of black people and of America generally?  `It depends on how good I do my job,' he said."""
157,You talk about somebody who seemed to have his head on about where he wanted to go ultimately.
158,"MR. STENGEL:  Oh, absolutely.  I think even in his memoir he was thinking about that.  And he's looking at--he's in a sort of transformational figure between the melting pot America and patchwork quilt America in the sense that he identifies with both.  Melting pot is we all become
Americans no matter our, our race, religion, creed.  Whereas the patchwork quilt America that we've started drifting towards is we all have our separate identities.  We're not Americans, we're African-American, we're Polish-American.  He does wants to transcend that.  And as, and as David was saying, he's not a black politician, he's a politician who happens to be black.  And he does wants us all to be at the table no matter, no matter where we come from, and say, ""Look, we have to have a more unified purpose.  What, what unites us is, is greater than what divides us."""
159,"MR. GREGORY:  Talk about Nelson Mandela, whom you write about, and the leadership lessons from Mandela.  There have to be obvious comparisons and certainly questions for Mandela about what he thinks about Obama. "
160,"MR. STENGEL:  Well, I did, I was telling David beforehand, I saw him during the election, and it was before there was a nominee, and Barack and Hillary were opposed to each other.  And I asked Mandela, I said, ""Well, who are you going to support?"" And, you know, he's older now, and he smiled at me and he went, ""I'm not going to go there,"" that universal symbol, ""you're trying to get me in trouble."" But I think he--that he looks at, at Obama as, as something that is very positive for the world. I mean, remember South Africa is a place that almost had a racial civil war.  The fact that Nelson Mandela is one of the greatest figures of the century is that he averted Armageddon, and he did it by preaching reconciliation.  Remember, they, they were a majority that was disenfranchised.  But he spent most of his first year as president talking to whites and basically saying, ""You know what, we're in this together."" There's a lot of similarity.  And there's a lot of similarity also in temperament.  Nelson Mandela went to prison when he was almost Barack Obama's age.  He was there for 27 years.  He was a hard-headed, tempestuous revolutionary who went into prison, and he came out as this calm, measured man.  You know, Obama's temperament is kind of amazing. He sort of formed it without having to go to prison for 27 years, which I wouldn't wish for on anybody.  So there's some similarity there."
161,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to end with this, there was a, a New Yorker cover, and we'll put it up here, that the president specifically write--liked, rather. And you write about it in the book.  And so there's the four panes of President Obama walking on water, until the final pane when he actually falls into the water.  And he liked it.  And, and you wrote, David, in the book, that it was a sense that, that he realized that, or that he didn't always believe his own hype.  There's no..."
162,"MR. REMNICK:  Well, I, well, I think he wanted to advertise the fact..."
163,MR. GREGORY:  That he wanted to advertise it in a sense...
164,MR. REMNICK:  ...that he doesn't believe his own hype.
165,"MR. GREGORY:  ...that, right, that..."
166,"MR. REMNICK:  I think he has a, he has a substantial ego."
167,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
168,"MR. REMNICK:  And this, of course, this cover came out before the great victory on health care.  And he--I--we sent him the cover, and Barry Blitt signed it, the artist.  And it said, ""Dear Mr. President, please keep dry."""
169,"MR. GREGORY:  But do you think he recognizes, despite enormous strength that he brings to the office, do you think he's fully aware of what he doesn't know or what his vulnerabilities are? "
170,"MR. REMNICK:  Well, I think there are some people who think that he, he doesn't know what he--that he doesn't know what he doesn't know.  And I don't think that's fair.  I think his style in meetings certainly is of, of listening.  He's not somebody who talks his way through a meeting, that he makes sure that everybody in the room has had their say, and then he processes it in a very deliberate, almost stylized way.  So, no, I think he does take in a lot of information."
171,"MR. GREGORY:  Rick, what do, what do you think is the hardest thing he faces now, post health care. "
172,"MR. STENGEL:  I think he faces--I mean, he has revitalized himself in his presidency, but he has to have a new mission.  He has to basically say, you know what, I'm not just a pragmatic politician.  I'm a moral leader, in a way. And what they've also done, which I think hurt them, is the sausage making process that was display--we all talk about how good transparency is--it wasn't good for them."
173,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
174,MR. STENGEL:  And he has to move past that.
175,"MR. GREGORY:  We will leave it, leave it there.  Thank you both.  We will leave it there, but we're going to continue our discussion with David Remnick and Rick Stengel a little bit more about their new books.  It's in our MEET THE PRESS Take Two Web extra.  It'll be online this
afternoon.  You can also read excerpts of ""The Bridge"" and ""Mandela's Way"" on our Web site, mtp.msnbc.com.  And you can see much more of David Remnick when he appears for a special discussion on the ""Today"" program. 
That is tomorrow morning."
176,We'll be right back here with some final thoughts on a big day in Washington coming up tomorrow.
177,(Announcements)
178,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Finally here, baseball is back.  The season begins tonight, but the real action is right here in Washington tomorrow when President Obama makes his opening day pitching debut.  Now, of course, there's a rich tradition in Washington of presidents tossing the first pitch of the season.  A century ago President Taft did it for the old Washington Senators, FDR in '38, Kennedy and Nixon.  President George W. Bush marked the debut of the Washington Nationals back in 2005.  Last year, and I don't want to sound bitter, but last year President Obama sat out opening day and the Nationals went on to lose 103 games.  What a difference a year makes, we hope.  Go Nats!

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, a shakeup on the Supreme Court.  Liberal Justice John Paul Stevens retires after more than three decades on the court. After a bruising battle over health care, will the president's second Supreme Court vacancy, this one in an election year, mark his next big fight with Republicans?  We'll speak exclusively to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama.
    "
1,"Then, America's role in the world, how will this week's agreement on nuclear disarmament make the country safer?  And why are so many friends and foes alike defying the United States?  Our conversation with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates."
2,"Finally, the roundtable takes on the growing left-right divide over the president's leadership, the congressional elections, and the politics of the court:  Columnist for The New York Times David Brooks; chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times David Sanger; syndicated Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker; and former Democratic Congressman from Tennessee and chair of the Democratic Leadership Council Harold Ford Jr."
3,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  But first, the politics of the Supreme Court.  The president has another big decision to make, the second court vacancy in two years.  How are the White House and Republicans weighing the confirmation battle ahead?  Joining us now to talk about that exclusively, the two members at the heart of the debate, the Senate Judiciary Committee who will oversee the confirmation hearings, Chairman Patrick Leahy of Vermont and ranking member Jeff Sessions of Alabama."
4,Welcome both of you back to MEET THE PRESS.
5,SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT):  Thank you.  Good to be here.
6,SEN. JEFF SESSIONS (R-AL):  Thank you.
7,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Leahy, you've conferred with the president, with the White House, how is he approaching this decision?"
8,"SEN. LEAHY:  I think that he's doing it in a very responsible way, he's doing it very methodically.  He wants somebody who is going to be a solid member of the court.  He has made it very clear he's not looking for somebody who'll be there to represent just Democrats or just Republicans but to represent Americans, to give a voice to Americans who are affected, everyday Americans who are affected by court decisions.  And in many cases, the court decisions have hurt ordinary Americans.  He wants somebody who has a sense of what real life is in America."
9,"MR. GREGORY:  Has he worked out whether he wants someone with political experience as opposed to somebody, as you often say, who's in that judicial monastery like a judge?"
10,"SEN. LEAHY:  Yeah.  Well, I--I've often said I wish we could have some more people outside the judicial monastery.  I think Justice Sotomayor came closest to that, having been a prosecutor and in private practice and a trial judge. But I'll let him, I'll let him speak to that.  I know that he has several extraordinarily good names before him, any one of whom would make a good justice of the Supreme Court, among the names he's considering."
11,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Sessions, when the president spoke about this on Friday, he, he said replacing Justice Stevens would be somebody who, in his mind, had to have an independent mind, who would have all the qualifications to be a judge.  And at the end of his statement he said this, let me play it for you."
12,"(Videotape, Friday)"
13,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  It will also be someone who, like Justice Stevens, knows that in a democracy powerful interests must not be allowed to drown out the voices of ordinary citizens."
14,(End videotape)
15,"MR. GREGORY:  That was described as a fight for the little guy, sensibility to the job.  How does that sit with you? "
16,"SEN. SESSIONS:  I'm not sure exactly what he meant by that.  I would say that any judge that faithfully follows the law, who respects the Constitution and understands that he or she is subordinate to that document really serves the average American.  It's when an unelected
lifetime-appointed judge, or five of them use their power, unaccountable power, to redefine the meaning of the Constitution to effectuate some policy agenda, some empathy, some ideology that they have, that's what threatens the average American.  And, and I'm hearing a lot about that, frankly, all over as I travel my state and in airports, that people believe that we are losing our constitutional respect, that our government is overreaching, and they're concerned about it."
17,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator, as you think about the political climate that this is happening, you've got a bruising healthcare battle that has just been waged, Republicans have said they are not interested in cooperating with the White House or with this president. Do you think this is going to be a big fight with Republicans and the White House?"
18,"SEN. SESSIONS:  You know, the answer to that is in the president's hands. I think Senator Feinstein said it well the other day, she said that she believed the president should nominate somebody that would get a very strong vote, 70-plus votes, bipartisan, that they were a proven and confident professional. That's the kind of nominee I hope that he nominates and that we can support. I would like to be, be able to support this nominee.  But if we have a nominee that evidences a philosophy of ""judges know best,"" that they can amend the Constitution by saying it has evolved, and effectuate agendas, then we're going to have a big fight about that because the American people don't want that."
19,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Leahy, isn't it important that the president select someone who unites the country?"
20,"SEN. LEAHY:  Well, I think that there is--right now, as Justice Stevens himself has said because of some of the decisions of the Supreme Court, they are beginning to lose credibility with the American people. Actually, and not for the reasons you may think, I agree with what Jeff Sessions has said, they have rewritten the law.  This is a very, very activist court, the most activist court in my lifetime.  They rewrote the law to say that--so they said that women could be paid less than men. They rewrote the law to say that age discrimination laws won't apply if corporate interests don't want them to. They rewrote the law to give ExxonMobil a $2 billion windfall.  And they rewrote the law to say that corporations could come in and meddle in elections in this, in this country.  All of those things went against the precedent..."
21,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
22,SEN. LEAHY:  ...and went against the laws of this country.
23,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator, the question I asked is whether you think a nominee should unite the country?"
24,"SEN. LEAHY:  I think a nominee--if, if Republicans and Democrats want to set aside politics, stop listening to the single-issue groups of either the far right or the far left, they can.  Remember, John Paul Stevens was nominated by a Republican president who was facing election.  He was a conservative Republican, and a Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed him in two and a half weeks overwhelmingly.  What has happened between then and today?"
25,"MR. GREGORY:  But I just want to pin you down on this point because back
in 2005 on this program after Sandra Day O'Connor retired, this is what
you--this was your advice to, to President Bush."
26,SEN. LEAHY:  Right.
27,"(Videotape, July 3, 2005)"
28,"SEN. LEAHY:  That's why we're going to meet with the, with the president in about a week.  We're going to urge that he put somebody who would unite the country, not divide the country."
29,(End videotape)
30,"MR. GREGORY:  So yes or no, does that same standard apply..."
31,"SEN. LEAHY:  Yes, of course."
32,MR. GREGORY:  ...to President Obama now?
33,"SEN. LEAHY:  Of course it does.  And, and--but it also requires people to not take a knee-jerk reaction.  One Republican leader's already said, ""Well, we may, we may filibuster."" He doesn't even know who... "
34,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, I'll..."
35,SEN. LEAHY:  ...who this is going to be.
36,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  I'll--we'll get to that in just a moment. Let's put some of the names who are on that short list.  There may be other names that are added, but this is what's thought to be the short list of names so far.  You have Judge Diane Wood, she's on the 7th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals; Elena Kagan, the solicitor general of the United States; Judge Merrick Garland, who sits as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals in the D.C. Circuit; and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano.  Senator Sessions, I want to make a disclosure, my wife Beth worked for Judge Garland at the Justice Department, he also performed our wedding ceremony.  That said, as you look at that list, is there any nonstarter there for you?"
37,"SEN. SESSIONS:  Well, I think that it's premature to say that.  We have a big responsibility to examine their background.  This is the only time in, in the entire process that the American people, through their elected representatives, have an attempt--have the opportunity to confront the nominee who could have a lifetime appointment for 30 or 40 or even 50
years... "
38,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator, you know these jurists, you know these
figures."
39,SEN. SESSIONS:  So I--I'm not going to prejudge that.
40,MR. GREGORY:  But you know these figures.
41,SEN. SESSIONS:  Yeah.
42,MR. GREGORY:  They came up when Judge Sotomayor was nominated.  You know these figures.  Are you prepared to say that they are all well-qualified to be on the Supreme Court?
43,"SEN. SESSIONS:  I think we better look at that.  I'm not prepared to make an announcement before we get into the background on it.  No, I'm not. "
44,MR. GREGORY:  The issue...
45,SEN. SESSIONS:  Let me just say...
46,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
47,"SEN. SESSIONS:  ...I disagree with Pat's analysis and criticism of the court, I don't think this court is an activist court.  I think they've attempted to faithfully follow the law, and just because they reach a decision that he may not like does not mean it's an activist court."
48,MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about procedure.
49,SEN. SESSIONS:  Sometimes Congress wrote the law badly.
50,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Sessions, the only..."
51,"SEN. LEAHY:  So they--so Jeff's--we wrote it badly.  What you're saying is OK, that they rewrote the law?  That's not what the court's supposed to do. They're supposed to interpret the law, not make law."
52,"SEN. SESSIONS:  You're exactly right, the court should interpret the law, not make the law, and should interpret it in a way that's faithful to the Constitution."
53,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Sessions, can you promise an up or down vote on the president's nominee?  Is a filibuster possible?"
54,"SEN. SESSIONS:  I promise a fair hearing, and I, I promise that the nominee will have a chance to explain any criticisms that are raised. But if a nominee is, is one that is so activist like Goodwin Liu that's just been nominated, who's written that, that the Constitution requires
welfare and health care to individuals, if it's somebody like that, clearly outside the mainstream, then I think every power should be utilized to protect the Constitution.  We'll not confirm somebody like that."
55,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  But, Senator Sessions, you're on record, you're on record in the past as saying..."
56,SEN. SESSIONS:  I just hope that doesn't happen.
57,"MR. GREGORY:  OK, you--you're on record in the past as saying filibusters should not be used against judges.  And yet--I want to be clear here--you are not taking a filibuster off the table in this particular case."
58,"SEN. SESSIONS:  We had a big fight over that debate, and Senator Leahy and his side won.  And they set a standard that says that if you have a, a nominee that under extraordinary circumstances a filibuster is appropriate to use against him.  I hope we do not do that.  I voted
against Sotomayor, but that was not a filibuster, and I think we'll just see how it plays out.  Depends on the quality of the nominee. "
59,MR. GREGORY:  But...
60,SEN. SESSIONS:  I think that's the standard the Senate has adopted in recent years.
61,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Leahy, for all the sound and the fury related to Justice Sotomayor--she was called a racist by some on the right, conservative commentators--she was still confirmed handily, and yet it is significant that your colleague here is not ruling out a filibuster.
That's the only area of uncertainty here because, as you know, the election of Scott Brown, Democrats don't, don't have a bulletproof majority."
62,"SEN. LEAHY:  The--they're not--look, the Constitution says that 51 senators can confirm somebody.  It doesn't require 60 senators.  I don't think there's going to be any kind of a filibuster.  You know, this last year we had about 100 and some-odd filibusters that--totally
unprecedented.  Actually, that's the lazy person's way out.  The American people pay us and, and elect us to vote yes or no, not to vote maybe. Every time you have a filibuster, you're saying, ""I'm not going to vote yes or no, I'm going to vote maybe."" That's irresponsible."
63,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, final, final point, Chairman.  When?  When are we going to hear a nomination?"
64,SEN. LEAHY:  I think you're going to hear a nomination very soon because we'd like to get this wrapped up this summer.
65,MR. GREGORY:  Within weeks?
66,SEN. LEAHY:  I think we're going to hear it soon enough so that we can wrap this up this summer.
67,"MR. GREGORY:  And you expect the justice to be in place by the start of
the term?"
68,"SEN. LEAHY:  Oh, there's no question.  It'd be irresponsible to do otherwise."
69,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, to be continued."
70,"Senators, thank you both very much this morning."
71,SEN. LEAHY:  Thank you.
72,SEN. SESSIONS:  Thank you.
73,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up next, America's role in the world.  How will this week's nuclear treaty make the country safer?  And why are so many friends and foes alike defying the United States?  A conversation with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Plus, our roundtable and all the week's political news:  David Brooks, David Sanger, Kathleen Parker, and Harold Ford Jr.  Only here on MEET THE PRESS."
74,(Announcements)
75,"MR. GREGORY:  Nuclear disarmament, the threat from Iran, and America's role in the world.  My conversation with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates after this brief commercial break."
76,(Announcements)
77,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  And we're back.  Last week President Obama traveled to Prague to sign a treaty with Russia to reduce each nation's nuclear stockpile by nearly 30 percent; and this week he will host the leaders of more than 40 countries for a global nuclear summit that begins tomorrow right here in Washington.  On Friday I sat down with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates at the Pentagon to talk about nuclear security, the Iranian nuclear threat, and America's role in the world."
78,"Secretary Clinton, let, let's talk about the nuclear issue.  So you've got critics on both sides of this decision--those who think that it goes too far, weakens America; those who think it doesn't go far enough.  So if this nuclear disarmament decision represents middle ground, is it
enough to make the world safer?"
79,"SEC'Y HILLARY CLINTON:  It certainly is.  And I, I know that this is a, a very important issue that I thank you for discussing with us, because the president's position is very clear.  We will always protect the United States, our partners and allies around the world.  Our nuclear deterrent will remain secure, safe and effective in doing so.  But we also think we will ultimately be safer if we can introduce the idea that United States is willing to enter into arms treaties with Russia to reduce our respective nuclear arsenals, and that we're going to stand against nonproliferation in a way that will perhaps deter others from acquiring nuclear weapons.  And so you have to look at the entire package:  Nuclear Posture Review, the New START treaty, and the nuclear security summit."
80,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Secretary Gates, this is not about the U.S. and the USSR anymore.  It's not about the U.S. and Russia anymore.  And critics, what they've seized on is this idea that American nuclear power, muscle, is ultimately what has deterred aggressors in the past.  So, as you look at this posture review, disarmament decision, how does this deter a country like Iran or North Korea from, you know, a--going away from their nuclear ambitions?"
81,"SEC'Y ROBERT GATES:  Well, first of all, we have still a very powerful nuclear arsenal.  The Nuclear Posture Review sets forth a process by which we will be able to modernize our nuclear stockpile to make it more reliable, safer, more secure and effective.  We have, in addition to the nuclear deterrent today, a couple of things we didn't have in the Soviet days.  We have missile defense now, and that's growing by leaps and bounds every year; significant budget increase for that this year, both regional and the ground-based interceptors. And we have prompt global strike affording us some conventional alternatives on long-range missiles that we didn't have before.  So, believe me, the chiefs and I wouldn't--the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I would not have wholeheartedly embraced not only the nuclear posture review but also the START agreement if we didn't think, at the end of the day, it made the United States
stronger, not weaker."
82,"MR. GREGORY:  But it still doesn't answer the question of if you're in Iran or North Korea and you've been proliferating even after disarmament started between the U.S. and Russia, what's to stop them from continuing down that path just because of this posture?"
83,"SEC'Y GATES:  Well, first of all, I think it puts us in a much stronger position in terms of going to other countries and getting their support for putting pressure on the Iranians and the North Koreans.  I think it also has, potentially, a deterrent effect on other countries who might be
potential proliferaters as they look at North Korea and, and Iran. "
84,"MR. GREGORY:  What is, Secretary Clinton, the bottom line threat of all of these missiles around the world getting into the hands of terrorists?"
85,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  It's a serious threat, David, and that's why the president has convened this nuclear security summit starting Monday.  We often say that the threat of nuclear war, as we used to think about it during the Cold War, has actually decreased, but the threat of nuclear
terrorism has increased.  And by that we mean that there's a lot of nuclear material that is not as secure.  It hasn't been destroyed.  It isn't under lock and key in many places in the world, particularly in the former Soviet Union, but not exclusively there.  We know that terrorist
groups, primarily al-Qaeda, persist in their efforts to obtain enough nuclear material to try to do something that would cause just such mass havoc and terror and damage and destruction that it would be devastating. And we know that a lot of countries haven't, until relatively recently, seen the threat as we see it.  You know, remember, we've been working for 
18-plus years to diminish the threat in a partnership with Russia; and we've worked--when my husband was president, we started working with some of the nation's that were part of the Soviet Union to get their nuclear material out.  But this hasn't been a high international priority, and that's what we intend to make it starting this week."
86,"MR. GREGORY:  Let, let me talk to a related topic, and that is trying to deter Iran from building a nuclear weapons program."
87,"Secretary Gates, is the notion of Iran becoming a nuclear power inevitable at this point?  Is the strategy of the U.S. government becoming more and more containment?"
88,"SEC'Y GATES:  No, we have not, we have not made that--drawn that conclusion at all.  And, in fact, we're doing everything we can to try and keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons.  We have--we're probably going to get another U.N. Security Council resolution, and that's really, I mean, it's important, but it's all--in it's own, in it's own right, in terms of isolating Iran, but it's also important in terms of a legal platform for organizations like the E.U. and individual countries to take even more stringent actions against Iran.  At the end of the day, what, what has to happen is the Iranian government has to decide that its own security is better served by not having nuclear weapons than by having them.  And it's a combination of economic pressures, it's a combination of more missile defense and cooperation in the Gulf to show them that any attack would--we can defend against and react against.  So I think it's a combination of, of all of these different options in terms of trying to convince the Iranians that, that they're headed down the wrong path."
89,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Secretary Clinton, it raises to me a larger question about the U.S. role in the world.  This president tried engagement as he came into office--engagement with the Iranians, engagements with the North Koreans.  It hasn't worked.  They don't want to talk.  They don't want to dance with this president.  So what is the next phase then?  What is America's influence in the world?"
90,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  Well, David, I would argue because the president was willing to offer engagement, we actually have more support vis-a-vis North Korea and Iran than was certainly present when he became president. The fact that Iran and North Korea have not responded makes our case, in a way.  And if you look at North Korea, for example, we now have a very 
clear understanding with the other members of the six party talks, led by China, that North Korea cannot be permitted to just go on its own course, that it has to be pressured to come back into this framework to try to get to the denuclearization of the peninsula."
91,"With Iran, a lot of countries were on the sidelines.  Their attitude was, ""Well, you know, the United States, you know, they're just hurling insults. They're not really, you know, willing to have any diplomatic engagement."" We said, ""OK, fine.  We're willing."" We, we stretched out
our hand.  The president made extraordinary efforts.  It was the Iranians who refused.  That has brought more people to the table.  We have unity in what's called the P5-plus-1, the permanent members of the U.N. plus Germany.  They are meeting in New York as, as we speak, to begin the hard process of coming up with the language of a resolution."
92,"MR. GREGORY:  So you don't think the U.S. would have to go, go it alone on sanctions before bringing others?"
93,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  No, not at all."
94,MR. GREGORY:  Before going to the United Nations?
95,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  No, I think..."
96,"MR. GREGORY:  Because you don't have results yet.  You say there's been all this unity, but there's been missed deadlines and you still don't have results."
97,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  Well, but, you know, David, I have--I'm a big believer in strategic patience.  I mean, you know, if we, if we could wave the magic wand and get everybody to move like we could.  But that's never been the case in the world.  You, you work through persuasion.  You present evidence.  We have been consistently doing so.  And, as Secretary Gates just said, the Security Council resolution will not in any way forestall us or the E.U. or other concerned countries from taking additional steps. But it will send a really powerful message.  The Iranians have been beating down the doors of every country in the world to try to avoid a Security Council resolution.  And what we have found over the last months, because of our strategic patience and our willingness to keep on this issue, is that countries are finally saying, ""You know, I kind of get it.  I get that they didn't, they didn't cooperate. They're the ones who shut the door, and now we have to do something."" "
98,MR. GREGORY:  Is a nuclear-capable Iran as dangerous as a nuclear state of Iran?
99,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  Well, clearly, weapons are more dangerous than potential. Potential is troubling, too."
100,MR. GREGORY:  Are they capable now?
101,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  They're, you know, that, that's an issue upon which intelligence services still differ.  But our goal is to prevent them from having nuclear weapons."
102,"MR. GREGORY:  Secretary Gates, I want to ask you about..."
103,SEC'Y GATES:  I'd say it's our judgment here...
104,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
105,SEC'Y GATES:  ...they are not nuclear capable.
106,MR. GREGORY:  They are not nuclear capable?
107,SEC'Y GATES:  Not yet.
108,MR. GREGORY:  And is that just as dangerous as being a nuclear state to your mind?
109,"SEC'Y GATES:  Only in this respect:  how you differentiate.  How far, how far have they gone?  If they--if their policy is to go to the threshold but not assemble a nuclear weapon, how do you tell that they have not assembled?  So it becomes a serious verification question, and I, I don't actually know how you would verify that.  So they are continuing to make progress on these programs.  It's going slower, slower than they anticipated, but they are moving in that direction."
110,"MR. GREGORY:  We've been talking about our foes.  I want to talk about our friends because I think a lot of Americans are troubled by some of our relationships with our friends in the world right now.  Hamid Karzai, who is the leader of Afghanistan, has done some things recently.  He's tried to establish control over what was supposed to be an independent election commission.  He invited the Iranian leader to Afghanistan in a move that seemed to try to embarrass the U.S.  He talked about the U.S. trying to dominate Afghanistan.  And now he made threats, apparently, to join the Taliban.  I think a lot of people are, are, are fair in
wondering why the American forces should fight and die for people represented by a guy like this."
111,"SEC'Y GATES:  Well--oh, go ahead."
112,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  No, go ahead, Bob."
113,"SEC'Y GATES:  I, I, first of all, I think you have to see this guy as, first of all, the president of Afghanistan and of a sovereign country. And when there are attacks on him, on his family, and what he perceives to be on Afghanistan itself, or insults to the sovereignty of Afghanistan, he's going to react and he's going to react strongly.  The fact is, on a day-to-day basis, speaking from our perspective, he has a very effective working relationship with General McChrystal.  He has cooperated with General McChrystal in going down to Kandahar to begin to
set the stage as the Kandahar campaign gets under way and talking to the local tribal leaders and, and so on.  So I think, I think we have to understand the pressures he's under, but, at the same time, understand their sensitivity.  This is a country that has been at war for almost two generations.  They have had armies come in and leave and, and--who have paid no attention to Afghan sovereignty.  We are working very hard at that.  We have to work as hard in our rhetoric as we are in our actions. "
114,"MR. GREGORY:  So do we--is the message here, don't overreact to some of this?"
115,SEC'Y CLINTON:  Absolutely.  You know...
116,MR. GREGORY:  Did you not overreact when you spoke to him on the phone?
117,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  I certainly didn't overreact.  You know, I think, David, some of what is said is, is not true, and a lot of others who make claims are, you know, short on evidence and very long on rhetoric.  This is a, a, a very difficult situation, and we are working very closely with, not only the president, but there's a whole government that is there.  I mean, we work well with a lot of the ministers who are, you know, dealing on a day-to-day business with our civilian and military leadership.  We have an international presence that each of our allies are working in different parts of Afghanistan.  And I personally, you know, have a lot of sympathy for President Karzai and the extraordinary stress he lives under every single minute of every day.  And, you know, I, I have a little experience in what it's like being, you know, in the political arena.  And in our country, you kind of know it goes with the territory. You put your toe out there.  This is new, this is something that Afghans don't have any experience with, a lot of countries around the world. He's not alone in wondering that if he's attacked by some newspaper in the United States, ""Is our government behind it?"" And that's not unusual for us to encounter.  I see it all the time in leaders that I deal with."
118,"MR. GREGORY:  So if there's a--if there's--people who get worried about our allies, frankly, not listening to the United States, take Israel for example. Was the United States blindsided by the fact that the Israeli prime minister abruptly decided not to come to this nuclear conference?"
119,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  No.  I mean, that's, that's a decision for a head of government, a head of state.  You know, Gordon Brown is not coming from Great Britain, Kevin Rudd is not coming from Australia, King Abdullah's not coming from Saudi Arabia.  There are many things.  It's like when President Obama had to cancel his trip to Indonesia and Australia.  There are all kind of things."
120,"MR. GREGORY:  This seems abrupt, though.  I mean, this seems there were a couple of abrupt things."
121,SEC'Y CLINTON:  Well...
122,MR. GREGORY:  At a low point in the relationship with Israel.
123,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  I'm sure that--well, the Indonesians and the Australians thought it was kind of abrupt when the president called up and said... "
124,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
125,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  ...""Oh, by the way, I'm not coming on this long-planned trip."" But the Israeli government will be represented at a very high level.  And, you know, they are--they share our deep concern about nuclear terrorism, and they want to be at the table as we try to figure out how we're going to make the world safer."
126,"MR. GREGORY:  This doesn't make the relationship even, even more difficult at a difficult time?"
127,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  No, not at all.  I mean, we have a deep and, and very close relationship between the United States and Israel that goes back many years. That doesn't mean we're going to agree on everything.  We don't agree with any of our friends on everything.  We have a special relationship with Great Britain; we have close relationships with France, our oldest ally.  Doesn't mean we agree on everything.  And I, I think that somehow since we're living in a 24/7 news cycle with, you know, things popping every minute, a lot is made of a little instead of trying to step back and see the forest instead of the trees.  And that's what, you know, I try to do every day.  What are the long-term consequences of what we're doing?  And, you know, you just can't react to every little event that some, you know, media outlet wants to blow up, you can't do that."
128,"MR. GREGORY:  Final point, a domestic matter.  There is this image, which I'm sure you've seen, of, of you embracing President Obama when health care was accomplished.  And, as you might imagine, people in the media could read in a lot to that given the history between you and the president and your history with the issue of health care.  And I just wonder, at the end of that process of healthcare reform being accomplished, whether you viewed that and said ""This is what I, this is what President Clinton ultimately hoped to accomplish, that healthcare reform in this form."" Is that how you feel?"
129,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  I was thrilled that we finally got healthcare reform passed. I mean, it's been a high priority of mine for many years, I often say I have the scars to show for it, and it was a wonderful historic accomplishment for the American people and I was thrilled that..."
130,"MR. GREGORY:  It's what you would have wanted back in '93, '94?"
131,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  Well, you, you know, everything that was done up until this time added to it.  You know, we--a lot of people made contributions going back to President Johnson and President Nixon and, you know, certainly my husband, and even, you know, the--President Bush.  There, there were building blocks, but getting it across the finish line with the kind of comprehensive reform that our country deserved to have didn't happen until this year, and I'm thrilled by it."
132,MR. GREGORY:  We'll leave it there.  Thank you both.
133,SEC'Y GATES:  Thank you.
134,SEC'Y CLINTON:  Thank you.
135,"MR. GREGORY:  And up next, our roundtable takes on the questions of presidential leadership, the upcoming congressional elections, and the politics of picking a new Supreme Court justice.  With us, David Brooks, David Sanger, Kathleen Parker, and Harold Ford Jr., after this brief
station break."
136,(Announcements)
137,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We are back, joined now by our roundtable with David Sanger of The New York Times, former Democratic congressman and chair of the Democratic Leadership Council Harold Ford Jr., David Brooks of The New York Times, and syndicated Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker."
138,"Welcome, all of you.  So much to get to.  Let's start with the politics of the Supreme Court."
139,"David Brooks, you, you heard Senators Leahy and Sessions.  News here this is going to happen fast, they said this morning, and you've got Republicans who are not taking a filibuster out of the equation, which is really the only level of uncertainty in all of this.  Size this up for me."
140,"MR. DAVID BROOKS:  Well, I think you--first of all, you've got a guy, you've got--what you see in Justice Stevens is the change in the way America's changed.  This was a guy--my favorite story about him, he was in Wrigley Field when Babe Ruth called the shot and hit his home run.  So he's from a different era.  He gets nominated at a time when he's sort of a moderate and he sails right through, and then the conservative establishment rises, we get a polarized era.  And so we get a period where everything is fought over.  And my sense this time is that they're--what the administration is doing, and we heard it here today from Senator Leahy, is cutting--trying to cut through that left-right by going ""man of the people"" vs. ""the powerful."" And so you're going to have a Supreme Court where every single member is Harvard or Yale, and a lot 
of the people talked about for the court are Harvard and Yale.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if they went outside that fraternity and tried to get somebody who reflects where the country is right now--extremely hostile to Washington, extremely hostile to the power establishment--and that will make it hard for Republicans to filibuster."
141,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you think--Harold Ford, you've heard a lot--the president say, ""Well, maybe I need somebody with some political experience."" He's somebody who's got a very well-developed sense of the Constitution and, and judicial philosophy, but does he want to move in
that direction where you get somebody who can really build consensus as a politician?"
142,"FMR. REP. HAROLD FORD JR. (D-TN):  He'll need to.  I think David's points are right.  I think, in addition, I heard Senator Leahy, the chairman, say that they--look--looking for someone with a broader set of experiences.  When you consider the kinds of cases--the business cases,
regulatory cases, cases involving patents and technology--I think it's likely that the names we've heard, all spectacular candidates, are not the complete list."
143,MR. GREGORY:  Mm.
144,"Interesting, Kathleen Parker.  If you look at where Republicans are right now--as I said, the only uncertainty has to do with the use of the filibuster. That's why elections matter, and Scott Brown's election matters again here. This is how Politico describes some of the strategic
thinking on the right right now:  ""Conservative activists say they won't ask their Republican allies to go to the mat over the president's nominee to replace Justice Stevens by pressing for the ultimate weapon - a filibuster.  Instead, they say the nomination of a Democrat to the court will be an opportunity to cement the support of the tea party movement, broaden their base, and motivate supporters to turn out to support Republicans in the mid-term elections in November."" So how?  How do they do all of that?  How do they accomplish that?"
145,"MS. KATHLEEN PARKER:  Well, the Republicans are in a real bind because, you know, they, they are now established as, as the party of not ""no,"" but ""hell, no."" In fact, that was played up in New Orleans again just recently."
146,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
147,"MS. PARKER:  And, you know, they, they want to appear to be open-minded and, and accepting of somebody who would be mainstream.  And yet, you know, their, their base is fired up, and they are very angry right now. And so you've somehow got to harness that anger and direct people to the polls.  So they're, they're, they're really in a, in a, in a bind.  I don't think they're likely to do the filibuster.  I think that's a very unlikely event.  But they're also--they've--there are some other little complications that come into play for them.  The 29 who voted against Sotomayor..."
148,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
149,"MS. PARKER:  ...are now kind of stuck with, ""Well, now if we vote for this one, are we going to look like we didn't vote for Sotomayor just because she was Latina?"""
150,MR. GREGORY:  Hm.
151,MS. PARKER:  So it all gets very complicated.
152,"MR. GREGORY:  You know, the question of judicial philosophy, David Sanger--and we covered the White House together, and these questions came up all the time with, with Roberts and Alito.  There is--and you heard it from Senator Leahy--among liberals, a sense that this court has moved far to the right.  Indeed, Justice Stevens said that he didn't change, the court changed. And they want a progressive pushback here.  Is that where the president's heart is?"
153,"MR. DAVID SANGER:  You know, it may be where his heart is, but it may not be where his mind is by the time he's done making this selection.  He's thinking that this is going to be the dominant domestic political issue between now and the November elections, and he's got to decide how big a fight he wants.  And I think that's why you heard him lay out his four criteria yesterday for who the next Supreme Court justice should be, but also why he played up what David pointed out, which was that Justice Stevens really does come from a different era where ideology did not seem to be the dominant issue in a, in a confirmation battle."
154,MR. BROOKS:  Right.
155,MR. SANGER:  And I think he'd like to get back to that.
156,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, and just to return to that point, David, you, you recall back during the State of the Union when the president references the Citizens United vs. the FEC case.  This was a 5-to-4 decision.  The court rules that the government can't ban spending by corporations in candidate elections. More money can, you know, get into the political system.  And this is what he said during the State of the Union to really take that on."
157,"(Videotape, January 27, 2010)"
158,"PRES. OBAMA:  With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the flood gates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections."
159,(End videotape)
160,"MR. GREGORY:  That was a striking commentary from, from that particular position, but also gets to this idea of what the president thinks the court needs and what a justice ought to have beyond being qualified. "
161,"MR. BROOKS:  Listen, there's a social context here.  We have become a divided society based on college education and non-college education. People without high school--without college degrees, much lower incomes, much higher divorce rates, much less social trust.  They take a look at people running Washington and running corporations, and they say, ""Those people don't get me."" And that's behind a lot of the anger we see in the country.  And every single issue reflects that in some way.  And so what the White House is doing right now is saying, even on the court, which is sort of an elite, highfalutin organization, ""We somehow want to tap into that.  We somehow want to play to that anger and that anxiety of people don't get us, and so we're going to maybe nominate somebody who will at least reflect the common experience."""
162,"MR. GREGORY:  Let, let me move on to the question of foreign policy now. And the president this week in Prague, he signs this disarmament agreement with the president of Russia.  So we see the president on, on the world stage at an important time with an important agreement.  I want to get to some of the particulars about nuclear strategy, about Iran, and even relationship with allies."
163,"But, David Sanger, let me ask you the larger question, which is how is this president trying to recast America's role in the world and how is that working?"
164,"MR. SANGER:  You know, David, he came in recasting it on the issue of engagement, which you raised with secretaries Clinton and Gates.  And he spent the first year basically saying, ""I am not George Bush.  And as a result, I'm going to reach out with a policy that suggests that America does not necessarily have to be the exceptional nation where everybody does it our way."" What's happened a year later than that?  The North Koreans and the Iranians, as you pointed out in the interview, have not exactly reciprocated. The Obama administration has not been able to get a U.N. resolution yet--I think eventually they will--against Iran.  The
Bush administration at least did get three in its second term.  So I think that the next few years for President Obama are going to be all about how does he deal with irreconcilable states that the rest of the world doesn't want to take on?  And that's what makes Iran such a fascinating test case."
165,"REP. FORD:  We have picked off more--I would agree with David.  We've picked off, under Obama's leadership, more terrorists in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border than we did--in the last year than Bush was able to in his last term. So if you think about George Bush and Condi Rice, he sent Condi Rice over to meet with her counterpart in Russia to say, ""We're going to build that big radar system with or without your approval."" This president decided to go a completely different tack, as David has laid out."
166,"You can't underestimate the power of engagement.  I think Secretary Clinton's point is--needs to be taken in context and should be amplified. The fact that you're able to go and sit with allies and erstwhile allies and say, ""We're doing things differently.  I'm not George Bush,"" would 
sound simple, but really is a powerful statement on the global stage.  I would agree with you fully.  Israeli-Palestinian talks, what happens this week with regard to nuclear proliferation, the talks on that front, and clearly the success we have in Afghanistan.  I thought the comments 
around Karzai were most fascinating between--with your interview with both Gates and Clinton."
167,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but... "
168,"REP. FORD:  But I think the engagement issue cannot be, cannot be understated."
169,"MR. GREGORY:  But talk more specifically now, Kathleen, about the nuclear disarmament questions related to proliferation.  There'll be this summit here in Washington.  So the president's really putting this on, on the agenda. What does this really mean in terms of safety in the world, in terms of America's power, and, most importantly, America's influence?"
170,"MS. PARKER:  Yeah.  Well, I'm not quite as optimistic as, as the folks on that side of the table.  I think engagement is very nice.  It's lovely to sit down at the table and chat.  And--but engagement is, is a tool, it's not a foreign policy.  And I think that is where the concern comes in among conservatives, and, and particularly when you talk about this, this issue of exceptionalism.  We're not, we're not the last word.  But most Americans do think that we are exceptional, and, and we have operated traditionally and historically and successfully from a position of strength.  And I think the concern is that we're compromising our, our role as--and, and that profile, particularly in the eyes of weaker nations who have always relied on us to, to be the big dog and to... "
171,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
172,"MS. PARKER:  ...and, and to be someone they can count on."
173,"MR. GREGORY:  You, you have a situation with foes, as I said at the beginning, where we're simply not being listened to.  Secretary Clinton said, ""Hey, this--we've tried our best now, and so now we have more unity in being able to act."" But how much unity really?"
174,"MR. BROOKS:  Well, I mean, it's--you--Obama has a great presence.  He's pretty good at engagement.  But it's--that is, as Kathleen said, that's a process, that's not an end.  And so you can, you can engage people, but if they are stuck in their views the way the Iranians are, the way the Hamas is, the way North Korea is or the Pakistanis are, you're just not going to get very far.  So you have to have a further view about what end state you want, some ideal vision.  And so I've always thought the problem with our Iran policy, we focus too much on the nuclear regime and the weapons, which everybody in Iran sort of wants; we don't focus on
the nature of the regime. And the nature of the regime is a lot more fragile than, than the weapons system.  That day--the day that woman Neda was shot, that was the day the regime lost its legitimacy.  And everything we should, we should be doing in a careful way is to undermine the legitimacy of that regime."
175,"MR. GREGORY:  David Sanger, what, what are the big questions, though, about disarmament, about this question with Iran that came up, you think, in the course of the interview and in the course of what you've talked to the president about recently?"
176,"MR. SANGER:  Well, what I thought was interesting about what Secretary Gates said to you and, and what President Obama said when we went in to interview him last week on, on this issue was that the distinction between an Iran that builds itself right up to the edge of having a weapon and an Iran that declares itself to have a weapon may not be all that big.  Most people think the Iranians are, at this point, way too sophisticated to come out and say, ""We've got a weapon,"" which is what the North Koreans did.  But instead, to do what Israel, what Japan and others have done, which is assemble all the technology so the world simply knows that they have the nuclear power.  And Secretary Gates said to you we wouldn't know, necessarily, when they had actually gone and assembled a weapon.  Well, this raises a really hard question, to the point that David raised before, which is what's your plan B? Because if
you get to the moment where the Iranians have all the pieces together, do the Israelis feel that they have to act at that moment?  Do the--does the U.S. feel that they have to step in and help the Israelis act? Is that the moment when engagement ends?  And the president has not yet said what his red line is out here.  And I'm not sure that this administration yet knows what its red line is."
177,"MR. GREGORY:  Kathleen, you, you write in a column this morning about this, this complicated relationship with allies like Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan. And, again, you saw that exchange.  What was noteworthy is a shift in the administration.  Here you had the secretary of Defense and the secretary of State saying, ""We're not going to react to some of these things.  We're going to be more sympathetic toward Hamid Karzai.  He's the guy that we have to deal with."" That was, that was a significant change."
178,"MS. PARKER:  Yeah, that was a shift as of right  his minute, right? We've been pretty hard on him, and he is the guy that was elected and he is the--he is our man.  We, we created Karzai.  And he's been under siege from everyone. I mean, Obama pretty much came out swinging during the--during his campaign, and he's had, you know, every European parliamentarian's coming after him. Everybody is on Karzai's back.  And, and naturally, he's going to react.  This is the testosterone axis of the world, and you don't insult a leader in public and then expect  him to just sit back and take it.  So he's..."
179,"MR. GREGORY:  And, in fact, Karzai met with General McChrystal today, and Secretary Gates made a point of saying that that's the level of cooperation that's important and that exists.  I mean, this is our commander on the ground leading our forces..."
180,MS. PARKER:  Right.
181,MR. GREGORY:  ...and you've got Karzai...(unintelligible).
182,"MS. PARKER:  Well, it's hard on our troops as well."
183,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
184,"MS. PARKER:  Let's just throw that in.  I mean, this happened in Vietnam. I heard from a, a Vietnam vet a couple days ago saying, you know, we--our morale was very badly hurt when we felt like we were fighting for a loser.  So if the United States is not supporting Karzai, then how do we expect our troops to feel enthusiastic about what their mission is?"
185,MR. GREGORY:  Hm.
186,"REP. FORD:  And clear articulation probably is needed, and I would expect the White House to get closer to that.  But let, but let, let's be, let's be clear.  The engagement issue is not a bad thing.  If you look at where we are with China, it is likely in the coming weeks, if not coming 
months, we will get closer to market forces determining the the true value of their currency, which will have a direct and immediate impact on our economic stability and growth here in our country.  We can make the point that there's, again, on the Iranian front, we may not have all that we want, but President Sarkozy was here last week declaring his support for our positions for sanctions or positions for further steps.  And even president--he has made clear and the Chinese leaders made clear, that he's more open to these ideas.  Deputy Secretary of State Steinberg last week articulated again our support for China in a, in a one China policy, our support for them vs. Taiwan, not vs. Taiwan, but Taiwan and Tibet not having greater force and credibility in the United States government, or for that matter the Congress.  So I think, as much as I'd like to have the clear articulation, the reality is what would that be?  That we're
going to go to war?  That we're going to take steps beyond where we are today?  I think the way they're going about this may not be ideal, but I think we're making steady, steady progress.  It's..."
187,MR. GREGORY:  I...
188,"REP. FORD:  It's likely, David, they're going to have to be clearer to, to--there's so many Davids on this set here--Sanger, Brooks..."
189,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah, right."
190,REP. FORD:  ...and Gregory here.
191,MR. GREGORY:  Well...
192,"REP. FORD:  It's likely they'll have to clear.  But to suggest that this engagement thing is not working to some extent, I think, I, I think slights them somewhat."
193,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let me, let me go a little bit larger here and talk about presidential leadership and put it in, in the political context, because there is an opposition party, and the Republicans, and they're trying to figure out how to mount that opposition, as we are in an
election year.  And there was a gathering of Republicans that got a lot  of attention, the Southern Republican Leadership Conference.  And you heard two prominent Republican voices, Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin, talking about how, again, Republicans position themselves to  counter President Obama.  Let's watch that."
194,"(Videotape, Thursday)"
195,"FMR. REP. NEWT GINGRICH (R-GA):  What the left wants to do is say we're the party of ""no."" ...  And so here's what I want to ask you to encourage every candidate you know, every incumbent you know, every staff person you know, every consultant you know, I think we should decide that we're going to be the party of ""yes."""
196,(End videotape)
197,"(Videotape, Friday)"
198,"MS. SARAH PALIN:  There is no shame in being the party of no if they're proposing, the other side, proposing an idea that violates our values, violates our conscience, violates our Constitution.  What's wrong with being the party of no.  ...  Or better said by the good governor of this state, he said, ""The party of `no'?  Nah, we're the party of `Hell, no!'"""
199,(End videotape)
200,"MR. GREGORY:  David Brooks, assess the GOP right now in terms of mounting this challenge, figuring out where it's going to be in 2010 and 2012. "
201,"MR. BROOKS:  You're turning to the party of ""maybe"" over here.  So this is a bad move for you.  Listen, Palin is great TV.  She's really attractive. Gingrich is sort of great TV.  He's got a billion ideas, 600 of which are really good.  But the fact is the, the Republican Party is
not Palin and it's not Gingrich.  The Republican Party is Rob Portman, who's running for Senate in Ohio.  It's Mark Kirk, who's running for, for Senate in Illinois.  It's Governor Christie in New Jersey.  These are the people who are actually governing.  And I happen to feel we pay a
little too much attention to people like Palin, who's sort of a sub reality figure on some TV show.  But these are the people that are actually running, and they've actually got it figured out. They're against a lot of what Obama's doing, but they're the party of ""yes."" They've got a whole series of policies.  Paul Ryan from Wisconsin has--can wonk your ear off.  And so that's the real party.  Palin, the tea parties--listen, the tea party movement is a movement without a
structure, without an organization.  No, no party, no movement like that lasts."
202,"MR. GREGORY:  Kathleen, about 20 seconds here.  Is, is President Obama a different figure for the Republicans to try to challenge after health care? Is he changed in some way?"
203,"MS. PARKER:  I don't think so.  I mean, I think he has presented himself as someone who is not afraid to fight.  And I think the Republicans now have recognized that they have a true foe in, in Barack Obama.  They're not going to be able to run over him, and he's formidable."
204,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Thank you all very much. We'll be right back.
205,(Announcements)
206,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Before we go, a sad note.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Poland this morning as the bodies of the Polish president and his wife and other top officials who died in that terrible plane crash in Russia were returned home to Warsaw this  morning. President Obama issuing a statement yesterday saying it was a tremendous loss for Poland, the United States, and the world."
207,"That is all for today.  We'll be back next week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

0,"
        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, an exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Big questions about new rules for Wall Street. Will reform really mean the end of bailouts?  And big questions about jobs. Wall Street rallies, but companies are still slow to hire. What will change that?  Plus, will the president ultimately have to raise taxes to tackle the debt?
    "
1,"Then, our political roundtable weighs in:  Pennsylvania governor and former DNC chair, Ed Rendell; Tennessee Congresswoman and tea party supporter Marsha Blackburn; political director of Atlantic Media, Ron Brownstein; and host of the new public affairs program ""Enfoque,"" airing on Telemundo, José Díaz-Balart.  They will debate the politics of the economy, which party stands to gain in this midterm election year, and what role the tea party will play in November."
2,"Finally, a look back during our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE.  Astronaut John Glenn defends the race to explore space."
3,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  But first, the outlook on the economy, the pace of recovery, and new rules for Wall Street.  Yesterday I sat down for an exclusive interview with the president's top economic adviser, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner."
4,"Mr. Secretary, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS."
5,"SEC'Y TIMOTHY GEITHNER:  Good to be here, David."
6,MR. GREGORY:  Always good to have you.
7,"Big developments at the end of the week, have to do with Goldman Sachs, the investment firm, in a civil fraud case that has been brought against the firm for allegedly misleading investment--investors, essentially selling products that they would never themselves buy.  If you take a step back, what is the broader significance of these charges?"
8,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  You know, David, I can't comment on the details of that investigation or on the merits, but I can tell you that I am very confident that we're going to have the votes for a strong package of financial reforms that'll bring derivative markets out of the dark, help protect taxpayers from having to fund future bailouts, and trying to make sure we're giving Americans some basic protection against fraud and abuse.  I think it's--we're very--I'm very confident we're going to have a strong bill because this is about the basic financial security of the
country, about the financial security of all Americans.  And I think we're going to see Republicans and Democrats come together and pass strong reforms."
9,"MR. GREGORY:  And we'll get into some of that reform.  Do charges like this, does a case like this--you won't talk about the specifics, I understand--does it help your case, getting financial reform?"
10,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Yeah.  Why would you need a case like this?  You've had eight and a half million Americans lose their jobs, you had millions of Americans lose their house, tens of thousands of businesses fail, worst financial crisis in generations.  That is a powerful case for reform. And, again, that's why I'm so confident we're going to see Americans come together and pass reform."
11,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, you had all of those things, sure.  And in this case, as it's alleged, you have somebody who apparently makes a billion dollars by betting against the market; and a firm, Goldman Sachs, denying wrongdoing but accused of, again, selling a financial product that it would itself not buy. I mean, doesn't this feed what America really resents about how Wall Street is operating?"
12,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Well, again, I can't comment on the merits of this case. But, again, in this financial crisis you saw a range of just terrible things happen--catastrophic failures in judgment by people running these institutions, catastrophic failures in basic protections governments have to provide--and the consequences were devastating."
13,MR. GREGORY:  Is it time to start teaching some people lessons on Wall Street?
14,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Oh, I think, again, the best thing we can do for the country is to make sure we put in place strong protections, rules of the game, reforms with teeth.  You want a system that acts pre-emptively to prevent these things from happening.  You don't want a system where we have to come in and clean up the mess later.  The best way to protect Americans from these things happening is to put a stronger system in place where people were able to act ahead of the storm, ahead of the abuse, ahead of the crisis."
15,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk more broadly, then, about financial regulation. Earlier this year President Obama issued a declarative statement, and let me play it for you."
16,"(Videotape, January 21, 2010)"
17,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  Never again will the American taxpayer be held hostage by a bank that is ""too big to fail."""
18,(End videotape)
19,"MR. GREGORY:  And so, at the heart of financial reforms, new rules for Wall Street.  Can you guarantee that these rules will guarantee no more bailouts?"
20,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  What we can guarantee is that if Congress joins with the president in passing the reforms we've proposed, reforms that passed the House, now working their way through the Senate, then taxpayers will not be on the hook for bailing out these large institutions from their mistakes in the future."
21,"MR. GREGORY:  Who will be, then?"
22,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Well, the banks are going to be on the hook for paying the cost of any future crisis.  That's a simple, basic proposition.  And, again, I think that's something you're going to see Democrats and Republicans agree on because it's a basic, fair--thing of fairness, which is why should we put the American taxpayer in the position ever again where they have to use a penny of their money to pay for the mistakes of large institutions?"
23,"MR. GREGORY:  But it's not like the government wanted to use their money this go-around.  The problem is that if a bank or a firm, a financial firm gets into trouble, what do they need?  They need cash to stay afloat.  So even if they put some cash on the table, what if they need
more?  Aren't the markets going to expect, aren't the firms going to expect that the government's going to be there? "
24,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Yeah, of course.  And that's why it's so important to put in place reforms.  Because, you know, it's not just we still have in place today the same system that caused the crisis.  Because of the actions we had to take, that we were forced to take to protect the
economy, that will leave people, if we don't reform the system, with the expectations..."
25,"MR. GREGORY:  But I don't see what will be different.  You say that they'll have to pay for it, but what if they need more cash still? "
26,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Again, the, the two most important things we are going to do and the reforms will do is make sure we can constrain risk taking by these large institutions, prevent them from taking on too much leverage, writing hundreds of billions of dollars in commitments they can't meet with capital, move derivatives out of the dark so that we can bring oversight to them."
27,MR. GREGORY:  Right.  You have to stop and tell the people what a derivative is.
28,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  A derivative is a way to buy insurance against some risk or to bet on some financial outcome.  You can do it in lots of complicated ways, but it's a form of insurance or it's a way to make a, make a bet on some particular financial outcome."
29,"MR. GREGORY:  Critics of, of you..."
30,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  But, but, David, I want to come back to your..."
31,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Yeah, please, I'm sorry."
32,SEC'Y GEITHNER:  I want to come back to your central thing again.
33,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
34,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  What these bills will do, they will make sure if a large institution ever again managed itself to the point where it can't survive on its own and has to come to the government for support, then the government will put its in--put it into receivership, it will wipe out shareholders, it will replace management and board, and we'll make sure that we wind that firm down.  We dismember it.  We sell it off so it cannot exist again to make those kind of mistakes in the future.  And we'll make sure while we're doing that that the taxpayer themselves are, are not exposed to a penny of loss."
35,"MR. GREGORY:  But Republican critics, including Minority Leader McConnell, says in fact these reforms amount to, in his words, ""an endless taxpayer bailout of banks."""
36,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Well, you know, some..."
37,MR. GREGORY:  Why isn't that true?
38,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  It, it's absolutely not true.  And as some of his members say, it was a bit over the top.  I've spent a lot of time with Republicans over the last several months and the last few weeks, even last week, end of last week, and I believe that we are very close on
this, that we agree on the vast bulk of the things necessary to end ""too big to fail,"" protect taxpayers in the future, and that's one reason why I'm so confident.  Now, we're not together on everything.  I think on derivatives and on consumer protection we're still some ways apart.  We may not get there.  But on too big to fail, on making sure we protect the taxpayer, I think we're very close and we're in broad agreement."
39,MR. GREGORY:  Do you have any Republicans who will vote for this?
40,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Oh, I, I'm very confident you're going to see Republicans vote for this. Again, you know..."
41,MR. GREGORY:  Do you have anybody now?
42,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Well, again, that's something that you're going--you'd have to ask them.  You got to ask the minority about that."
43,"MR. GREGORY:  But you're working them, right?  You're trying to bring them along."
44,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Yeah, but I spent a lot of time with them.  And that's--again, that's why I'm so confident.  I mean, you know, how can anyone look at this crisis, look at the damage caused and say that we're going to leave this system in place, not support a strong set of reforms?"
45,"MR. GREGORY:  You, you have been on different sides of this financial crisis, at the Fed and now as Treasury Secretary.  I'm curious to note, do you believe there are any rules for Wall Street that could prevent the kind of collapse that we saw?"
46,SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Absolutely.  Absolutely I do.
47,MR. GREGORY:  That could have prevented it?
48,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Absolutely.  You know, we made a series of devastating mistakes as a country.  We let large institutions, taking on enormous risk, operate in the dark outside of any basic constraints on risk taking, completely untenable.  We let the country come into this crisis
without basic tools to put a bank, put a bank into bankruptcy, large institutions like AIG into bankruptcy.  Those were terrible mistakes, and they are preventable mistakes.  And I'm confident, again, with this bill--this is a very strong bill Senator Dodd has put together.  It
incorporates a lot of Republican ideas.  And I'm very confident with those protections we can reduce the risk of a crisis like this happening again, prevent this kind of thing from happening again."
49,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you think you can really change the culture of Wall Street? Can you change the risk taking, all of the, you know, the, the search for profits that lead to the sort of excesses we saw?  Can you really change the way they do business?"
50,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Look, if you allow a system to create enormous opportunities for return where people can get the upside without being exposed to the risk, it's going to attract lots of people--not the, not the best kind of people--to that business.  You can't run a system on the
expectation that firms are going to act in any way other than what they think is their best interest.  What you have to do is to make sure that the government is setting rules with teeth that prevent them from taking risks that could imperil the economy as a whole."
51,"MR. GREGORY:  But you--but you're sometimes criticized as a containment guy instead of a more hard-charging, roll back Wall Street kind of guy. And I go back to a question I asked in regard to the SEC charges, which is is it time to start teaching some people lessons?"
52,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Well, again, the best lesson we can teach and the best thing we can do for American people is to put in place rules that will prevent firms from taking these risks again, make sure we protect the taxpayer, bring derivatives out of the dark.  That's what we can do.
That's the best thing we can do for people.  And again, the American people deserve that.  I mean, you've seen a devastating loss of trust and confidence in this financial system, and we have to work very hard to restore their basic sense of trust and confidence that the system's going to provide protections they need."
53,"MR. GREGORY:  There are some on Wall Street who have worked with this administration, and some who are critical, who say the view from you, from the president and others in the administration, largely driven by politics, is it's open season on the banks.  It's beat up on the banks time.  Is that the smart thing to do politically or for the economy?"
54,SEC'Y GEITHNER:  There's no politics in this.  This is not a partisan thing. This is a basic proposition.  Things that are important...
55,MR. GREGORY:  It's not good politics to beat up on the banks?
56,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  I don't know if it's good politics or not, but we're going to do what's good for the country, what's good policy.  That's what the president asked me to come do and..."
57,MR. GREGORY:  But you know there's a populist wave in the country against the banks.  Jamie Dimon was criticized for going to speak at Syracuse. And a lot of the statements of the administration can contribute to that. Do you think that's unhelpful for the economy?
58,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Again, what the president is going to do and what he's asked me to do is to make sure we are designing reforms that are going to change what was broken, protect the American people better in the future. Our judgment is--he governs this way, David, the president governs this way.  You focus on doing the right thing, you let the politics take care
of themselves. Now, it's not always going to be popular, people are going to fight you on these kind of things, but we're going to focus on doing the right thing."
59,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk about the broader economy and really some encouraging news.  This was The Wall Street Journal headline this week, ""Dow Breaks Through 11,000.  Stocks Rise on Outlook for the Economy, Corporate Earnings; Individuals Still on the sidelines. You're out  there talking to people; you see so much.  What gives you a reason to be optimistic right now?"
60,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Well, again, you're seeing in the numbers, and if you talk to businesses across the country in all industries, you see much more confidence today.  The economy's growing.  It's the private sector that's growing, private investment is increasing, exports are stronger. Americans are spending a bit more of their income.  These are very encouraging signs, and I think they should--they allow us to be much more confident today that we're going to come out of this stronger.  But, you know, we have to deal in reality too.  And the reality still is that this crisis caused a huge amount of damage.  It's going to take a long time to heal that damage.  Americans are still facing enormous pressure, enormous financial challenge.  And we're going to keep working to make sure we're healing what was broken, reinforce this recovery; and we got some work to do still."
61,"MR. GREGORY:  So--and that headline refers to individuals still on the sidelines.  You have 8.5 million jobs lost in the course of the recession.  In March, and something that the, the Fed chairman was concerned about, 44 percent of those unemployed in March have been unemployed for six months or more.  Is this a jobless recovery? "
62,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  I think the economy's just starting to create jobs again. That's going to continue.  Just remember, a year ago the economy lost three quarters of a million jobs in one month of March.  And last month the economy created 160,000 new jobs, and I think we're now on a path where you're going to see sustained job creation.  You're going to see the work week extended, people add hours to their payroll, incomes start to rise again, more people come back to work.  And, again, we have more work to do, though, to help reinforce that process."
63,"MR. GREGORY:  You don't see the unemployment rate climbing again to, say, over 10?"
64,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  No, I'm not an economist, David, but if you see that happen it'll be because you have more people come back into the work force now because there's hope again.  But, again, I think that we're in a much stronger position than--now today than we were three months ago, six months ago, stronger than we thought, faster recovery than many people expected because of the actions the president took."
65,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet you said recently, you told Matt Lauer on the ""Today"" show recently that the unemployment rate will be unacceptably high for a long period of time.  These are the administration's projections--we'll put them up on the screen--for unemployment, all the way out to the fourth quarter of 2012 at 7.9 percent, which is still pretty high.  I assume you'd think that would be unacceptably high.  So what would incentivize companies to build a new factory now or to look ahead and start adding workers to change and improve upon that outlook?"
66,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  We're going to work to improve on those numbers.  That's what we're working hard to do.  And we're trying to get Congress to move to put in place a series of new tax incentives for hiring, for business investment. We're trying to work to make sure you can--states can keep teachers in the classroom, that we're working to fix schools, fix our roads and bridges, improve infrastructure.  There are a range of things we can do like that that'll help make this recovery stronger.  And, as we grow again, we see more job creation, not less."
67,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to ask you about housing because this is an important area.  It's critical in terms of the overall rebound of the economy.  The administration had a big program to modify mortgages, to be able to keep people in their homes.  You had a congressional oversight
committee this week say that the Treasury Department has lagged behind the, the pace of the crisis.  And the USA Today reported this on Thursday:  ""Foreclosure filings rise in spite of aid program's efforts. Home foreclosures are accelerating - and many more people are losing
their homes - more than a year after the government launched a program to aid financially distress borrowers."""
68,"Mr. Secretary, I've heard you say, ""Look, you have to remember how bad things were."" Nevertheless, this is a results problem, is it not?"
69,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  No, I don't think so.  The president's program did the necessary vital essential thing, which is to bring stability to house prices that were falling off the cliff.  Now, as you know, for most people in the country, their house is the most important financial asset.
So, by helping stabilize house prices, we made an enormous difference in people's basic financial security.  The president did that by working with the Fed to help bring down mortgage interest rates, which were at historic lows.  Four million Americans have been able to refinance
because of that, and we've also--and this program we currently refer to is designed to help the innocent victims of the subprime crisis.  And a million Americans today are getting lower monthly payments on their mortgage debt on average $500 a month because of the president's program. And we are working very hard to make sure that program reaches more Americans.  We announced a series of programs over the last several weeks..."
70,MR. GREGORY:  But...
71,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  ...that will help the unemployed, help people..."
72,"MR. GREGORY:  Right, but you're trying now to get, get lenders to reduce their principal for people because you have, and this was always the warning about a mortgage remodification, that people redefault..."
73,SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Well...
74,MR. GREGORY:  ...and end up getting foreclosed on.
75,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Again, but you're right to say that the, the changes we made recently are to help the unemployed, help people who are underwater refinance, help make sure that more of the relief comes in the form of principal reduction.  And we're--also gave the 10 hardest-hit states, states at the epicenter of the crisis, the subprime crisis, with high unemployment, we give them a significant amount of resources to help incent pilot programs that'll help address just those problems.  And we're going to keep working to make sure we reach more people.  But hold on, David, one more thing. "
76,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
77,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Very important to recognize that we are not going to help, not going to be able to help, and it's not a--would not be fair for us to ask the American people to help, people who are speculating on resources, on, on real estate or who are just basically irresponsible in
their financial decisions.  But we're going to reach more people, and this program has been very effective, and bring a measure of stability to a housing market that was in crisis and in reaching Americans who are the, the greatest victims of the subprime mess."
78,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think the worst of the foreclosure crisis is over?
79,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  I think it's going to be very hard still.  I mean, realistically again, unemployment is very high, as you said.  That's the biggest risk now in terms of what's driving foreclosures ahead.  And that's why, again, it's so important that we work with Congress to
strengthen the recovery and make sure we're creating more jobs more quickly."
80,"MR. GREGORY:  This past week was tax day, and I want to talk about taxes and spending.  But first I want to ask you what is your level of concern about inflation as you look ahead perhaps to next year? "
81,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Again, our biggest challenge now--and this is a challenge not to just the United States but in all the major economies--is to make sure that growth is stronger, we have a recovery  led by the private sector that could be self-sustaining.  That's our biggest challenge. "
82,"MR. GREGORY:  When we talk about taxes and spending, the debt is a huge concern right now.  Right now, America's debt is 53 percent of the total economy.  And deficit hawks like Robert Bixby, quoted in the Washington Times on Wednesday, says this:  ""The basic challenge is political in that we've gotten to a situation where the spending promises we've made can't
be financed with the levels of taxation we've agreed upon.  Getting out of that dynamic require either cutting back on the spending promises or raising taxes.  Those are politically explosive choices."" Will the president have to consider raising taxes on the middle class if he's going to be serious about taking on the debt?"
83,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  David, as you know, the president does not support raising taxes on people making less than $250,000 a year, and the president recognizes that our deficits are too high and they're going to have to come down over time.  But look what he's done when he came into office.  He came in and cut taxes, as he should have, on 95 percent of working families.  He provided substantial tax incentives to businesses to help stimulate private investment. He's committed to bring these deficits down.  He's outlined a very hard, ambitious set of proposals
that'll cut our deficits by more than half as the share of our economy over the next four years or so.  And he's convinced Republicans to join on a bipartisan fiscal commission to make sure that we can propose reforms, identify policies that will take us back to where we're..."
84,"MR. GREGORY:  But is it enough?  First of all, he is cutting taxes for 95 percent of Americans.  He's also raising taxes.  The Bush tax cuts will expire.  There are tax hikes included in healthcare reform.  Look, as Pete Domenici..."
85,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Well, health, healthcare reform..."
86,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
87,SEC'Y GEITHNER:  ...healthcare reform is enormously important and will be enormously important and effective in helping bring down our long-term deficits.
88,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, OK, but there's some--there's debate it about even though that's certainly the assertion..."
89,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  No, but, no, but..."
90,MR. GREGORY:  ...about how it was passed.
91,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Again, in our country we turn to the independent..."
92,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
93,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  ...budget analysts in the CBO to make those judgments. And their judgment--and this is why we have healthcare reform today, because the president wouldn't have it any other way--in their judgment, healthcare reform will bring down our long-term deficits dramatically over time."
94,"MR. GREGORY:  Why don't you have to consider additional tax hikes when you've got the likes of Alice Rivlin who worked for President Clinton, Republican Senator Domenici, and Chairman Bernanke saying, ""Look, something's got to give here, and tax hikes have to be on the table in
this environment."""
95,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  But, David, you, you said the important thing, which is the president is going to extend the middle-class tax cuts.  But he is also going to let expire the tax, the tax cuts that President Bush put in place for the 2 percent of the most fortunate Americans in our country. That will provide more than $1 trillion--around $1 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years.  That's very important.  In addition to that, the president proposed a range of other measures to help close tax loopholes, reform international tax, tax treatment of international companies in the United States.  He proposed a fee on banks on risk to help make sure we cover any losses on the TARP, and he proposed a substantial freeze on discretionary spending, reimposed the basic budget rules, PAYGO, that were in place in the '90s, helped deliver services..."
96,"MR. GREGORY:  But our, but..."
97,SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Those are--but those are necessary...
98,MR. GREGORY:  ...but are any of these serious enough to really tackle the trajectory that our debt is on? 
99,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Absolutely.  And, you know, David, let me just step back for a second.  this is something we can manage as a country.  Again, just think about it this way:  A--even a moderate recovery and a moderate recovery along with the president's commitment to make sure the recovery act expires, the emergency acts we took expire when the, when the economy strengthens. Those two actions themselves will cut our  deficits in half as a share of the economy.  Bring them down from 10 percent of--as a share of GDP to around 5 percent of GDP.  Now, that's not far enough.  The other measures that you've just identified will take
us down below 4 percent of GDP, and we've asked the commission to--which is a very talented group of people..."
100,MR. GREGORY:  This is your debt commission?
101,SEC'Y GEITHNER:  ...to step back from politics...
102,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
103,SEC'Y GEITHNER:  ...and recommend additional measures to make sure...
104,MR. GREGORY:  But do you believe painful choices will be necessary by the government?
105,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Well, of course they will."
106,MR. GREGORY:  Without a doubt?
107,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  But these--but of course.  These are the things we can do as a country.  Again, we are in a much stronger position to deal with these challenges, and it's true for any major economy across the..."
108,MR. GREGORY:  What's a painful choice you would advocate to the president if he wants to be really serious about tackling the debt?
109,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Well, the president has, has made some very important, and I think, good policy proposals to the Congress already to consider that are very substantial, and we hope they act on them."
110,"MR. GREGORY:  Any specific thing, though, that you would advocate?"
111,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Just the ones, again, the ones I highlighted.  It's
very..."
112,"MR. GREGORY:  Anything with regard to entitlement spending, Medicare, Social Security, that you would advocate?  Tax reform, broad-based tax reform?"
113,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  We're going to look at all those things, and the commission, of course, the commission and its, its basic mandate is this, is to step back from politics, take a look at all those things, and, and come forward with recommendations..."
114,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
115,SEC'Y GEITHNER:  ...that'll help return us to the point when we're living--where we're living within our means again as a country.
116,MR. GREGORY:  Two quick points before we're out of time.  Would the president support a gas tax if it were part of an overall climate change piece of legislation?
117,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  David, that's not something I can address today.  As you know, he's working with a number of senators to try to make sure we can put in place the kind of energy reforms our country needs.  If you talk to businesses across the country, one thing many of them agree on is we need to bring certainty to what the rules of the game are and how we, how 
we use energy, make sure we're encouraging greater energy efficiency, not just for climate change but because it's important for energy independence, and the president's going to keep working on that."
118,"MR. GREGORY:  So is he looking at a, at a gas tax?"
119,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Again, not..."
120,MR. GREGORY:  Is he considering it?
121,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  ...not something that I can help you on today.  But we are working on making sure we change how we use energy in this country, both for energy independence and to make sure we're using it more efficiently for climate change."
122,"MR. GREGORY:  Finally, before I let you go, as I mentioned, it was tax day. You also saw these tea party rallies around the country.  And it seems that their biggest grievance, those that show up to these rallies, have to do with taxes, with government spending, with the size of the deficit.  How serious do you take those concerns?  How viable a political force to you consider the tea party to be? "
123,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Let, let me do the positive side of this, OK?  We've just been through eight years where people said, many people said, ""Deficits don't matter.  We can, we can pass huge tax cuts, pass huge, new programs without paying for them."" That debate has changed fundamentally.  Now, you don't hear people say anymore deficits don't matter.  You don't hear people saying that we can pass enormously--enormous expenditures of government without paying for it. That's an important change.  I think all Americans understand that our deficits are unsustainable, and I think that'll be helpful as we move to try to make the hard choices to bring them down again."
124,"MR. GREGORY:  Mr. Secretary, we'll leave it there.  Thank you very much. Appreciate it."
125,"SEC'Y GEITHNER:  Good to see you, David."
126,"MR. GREGORY:  And up next, our roundtable.  Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, Atlantic Media's Ron Brownstein and Telemundo's José Díaz-Balart tackle the economy, the midterm elections, and the impact of the tea party.  Plus our MEET THE PRESS minute, defending the race to space, only here on MEET THE PRESS."
127,(Announcements)
128,"MR. GREGORY:  The politics of the economy, what role will the tea party have on the midterm election?  After this brief commercial message."
129,(Announcements)
130,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We're back now with our political roundtable, joined now by Republican Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee; Democratic Governor Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania; host of the new public affairs program ""Enfoque,"" Telemundo's José Díaz-Balart; and political director of Atlantic Media, fellow Washington Capitals fan, Ron Brownstein."
131,Welcome to all of you.  I want to talk about this left-right political divide over the economy.
132,"But let's talk first, Congresswoman, about Secretary Geithner.  You heard what he said."
133,"REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN):  Yes, I did."
134,MR. GREGORY:  New rules for Wall Street mean no more taxpayer-funded bailouts.  Is it case closed?
135,"REP. BLACKBURN:  No, it is not closed at all.  And what the American people want to be certain that we do not do is take boom and bust and replace it with fraud and bailout.  And they are tired of the bailouts, they want this to end."
136,MR. GREGORY:  But he said the banks are going to pay for it now.
137,"REP. BLACKBURN:  This too big, this ""too big to fail""--and they know better than that."
138,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
139,"REP. BLACKBURN:  They know that this financial regulatory reform bill in its current form that is working its way through is going to institutionalize the bailouts.  And this is something that they do not want.  Everyone is for reform, but..."
140,"MR. GREGORY:  But I have to stop you, Congresswoman.  What you heard him say, the banks would actually pay for this.  Just tell me, why don't you believe that?"
141,"REP. BLACKBURN:  Into a fund.  Into a fund.  Because you can look at history and see that it always gets passed.  It's the Reagan thing. Corporations don't pay taxes, people do.  They know that they're going to see fees go up. The way community banks are treated..."
142,"MR. GREGORY:  They could pass it on, in other words, yeah."
143,"REP. BLACKBURN:  ...through this consumer financial protection agency is horrendous.  It would be the demise of community banking.  I know everyone is working to get to reform that is going to be as tough on Wall Street as it is on Washington.  And Washington has some responsibility to bear in this, also. And, David, that's what they're wanting to see.  They want to see real reforms.  Just like they did in health care, they wanted to see reform, what they got was control.  They don't want more Washington control coming out on this regulatory reform bill."
144,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor, are these rules that can really prevent what we've gone through?"
145,"GOV. ED RENDELL (D-PA):  Sure.  I think the key thing you heard Secretary Geithner say is that if a bank gets in trouble, they get dismembered, they get taken over, they get--essentially, they go away.  They do away because they're punished for what they do.  And I think that's the biggest incentive of all. You know, what the Republican Party is doing now is like the death squad stuff.  They think if they say it often enough, ""this doesn't end,"" ""too big to fail,"" people will believe it. But it's not true.  And this is a real test for the party of ""no."""
146,MR. GREGORY:  And wait...
147,GOV. RENDELL:  And they have to say yes to something.
148,REP. BLACKBURN:  We're the party of K-N-O-W.
149,GOV. RENDELL:  They have to say something.
150,REP. BLACKBURN:  Of K-N-O-W. We want people to know what's in this bill.
151,GOV. RENDELL:  They have to do something.  They can't keep taking money from these Wall Street companies...
152,"REP. BLACKBURN:  Oh, Governor, you know that's wrong."
153,"GOV. RENDELL:  ...and then do their bidding.  We have to pass a strong
financial reform."
154,"REP. BLACKBURN:  Governor, you know that's wrong."
155,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Well, what's fact and fiction here?"
156,REP. BLACKBURN:  You know that's wrong.
157,"MR. GREGORY:  Whats fact from fiction here on new rules for Wall Street, Ron?"
158,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Well, there are two separate issues.  First is how you regulate these large, systemically risky institutions.  And the bill does establish--both bills, the House and the Senate bill--for the first time, distinct federal oversight of the largest institutions whose failure
could put the entire financial system at risk.  And that is something--when you said that the public does not want more Washington control, I think the polling is pretty clear that on this front the public does want more Washington oversight of these large institutions which is not available now and would now be through a council of federal regulators in the Fed."
159,"The second issue is what you do when one of these behemoths fall over anyway and collapse, and, and that is what we went through in 2008.  And if you think of the 2008 as your template for a bailout, where you put a lot of money in a, in an institution and it continues to exist--same management, stockholders, and so forth--the, the version of the Senate bill that was negotiated by Democrat Mark Warner and Bob Corker of Tennessee is designed to prevent that. What they both say is that the resolution mechanism in the bill is designed to eliminate the management, wipe out the stockholders, force the creditors to take a haircut, and
then that bank would be--or financial institution would be dismembered. Now, Bob Corker has raised the concern in the last few days that around the edges of that there are other provisions that may allow for more federal intervention without that kind of draconian response.  But he has also said that those differences could be resolved in ""about five 
minutes"" if there was good will on the part of the two parties, which Mark Warner has said as well."
160,MR. GREGORY:  José...
161,REP. BLACKBURN:  Well...
162,"MR. GREGORY:  José, one of the issues, you hear about this SEC filing..."
163,MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  That's right.
164,"MR. GREGORY:  ...and Goldman Sachs has denied any wrongdoing, but, I mean, the way this goes is essentially they're accused of being a middle man on a transaction where you have all these bad--all this bad debt... "
165,MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  Right.
166,"MR. GREGORY:  ...that's part of a financial product that Goldman Sachs wouldn't itself buy, and this, this charge of, of misleading people.  I mean, this is what drives people crazy around the country."
167,MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  Absolutely.
168,MR. GREGORY:  And are we really going to change any of that?
169,"MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  Well, you know, I--we hear ""reform with teeth."" We hear about ""too big to fail."" We've been hearing this for so many years.  And you know what?  A lot of people are watching what's going on in Washington and New York and their eyes are glazing over because it doesn't affect or it doesn't benefit them at all in their communities, you know?  We continue with high unemployment.  The Hispanic community, almost 14 percent of the men in the Hispanic community are unemployed. And what they see is more investment in government and less investment in small towns and in small businesses.  And a lot of people are saying, ""You know what?  Maybe the government shouldn't be so worried about funding government agencies and government programs, and let's start taking care of the small and large businesses that are in the community, and they're the ones that hire."" You know, we hear all this money going into, for example, construction projects.  For the Hispanic community, something very important.  Then you have E-Verify.  E-Verify limits, in certain ways--because of its--by the way, it has a high error rate--the amount of Hispanics that feel that they are in some way drawn into those businesses and into those projects.  You know what?  Government
investment is important, but government investment also has to recognize that the people who generate jobs in this country are the small businesses, are the bodegas or the supermarkets, are the gas stations. And those people find absolutely no help out of Washington or New York."
170,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, so here's a larger political question for everybody. Ron, I want to start with you, because you've, you've looked at this
analytically."
171,MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Mm-hmm.
172,MR. GREGORY:  Who is winning politically...
173,MR. BROWNSTEIN:  That's a great question.
174,"MR. GREGORY:  ...on the economy?  Whether it's regulation, whether it's jobs, whether it's stimulus, who's winning, Republicans or Democrats, in this election year?"
175,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Well, by and large it feels as though Republicans are driving the argument, and that they--look, they're--the construct that Republicans have made is that what is impeding recovery is primarily big government at this point.  After--which--and to a large extent, they have succeeded in that argument.  You look at all the trend lines--Democratic advantage over Republicans on the economy, Obama approval on the economy--those are all declining.  I mean, this is rather striking after the largest failure of the market economy in 2008 probably since the Great Depression.  Democrats, I think, have been losing control of the macro argument here.  Wall Street, though, is a place that really--and the, and this financial regulation is a place where these two contending visions collide. Because I think the--as you heard from the congresswoman, the Republican argument primarily is that more government intervention is the problem.  And Democrats, I think, want to make the case that what led to this disaster was the hands-off approach that the Republican administration took, the Bush administration, the low tax, low regulation approach that their agenda was built around led to this.  And I think you are going to see these contending both policy and political visions very clearly on display if this bill comes to the Senate floor next week."
176,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor, on the economy, taxes are a big piece of this. And here was a provocative thought.  It was, it was reported by the Los Angeles Times this week.  ""A key question in this closely contested midterm election year is whether Democrats will get cold feet over raising taxes during hard economic times.  `They are in a push-pull situation,' said Roberton Williams, a tax policy analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.  `They really want the money [from raising taxes].  But they don't want to quash the nascent recovery.  How do you thread that needle?'"" At a time when they're preparing to let the Bush tax cuts expire."
177,"GOV. RENDELL:  Well, I think the most important thing--and I think what was said about small business is, crucial.  The tax cuts in the stimulus were one-third of the stimulus bill.  Nobody knows that.  In Pennsylvania 2.7 million taxpayers got cuts because of the stimulus bill.  Small
businesses have received a ton of incentives both in the original stimulus bill and in the recently passed jobs bill.  I think you've got to take your tax cuts and target them to job creation.  And I think the Obama administration has done a good job and is doing a better job of that recently, and I think we can do more to do that."
178,"In terms of the Bush tax cuts itself, the focus, again, has to be directed to the people who are--we're letting the tax cuts expire.  Those people can afford to pay more taxes.  After the Bush tax cuts expire, the tax rate will still be the same as under Ronald Reagan."
179,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, Congresswoman, before, before we move on, make the case for why, as Ron suggests, the Republican Party is on the right side of this economic debate in this election year."
180,"REP. BLACKBURN:  The reason the Republican Party is on the right side of this economic debate is simply this:  The election is going to be about freedom, and the American people know that being dependent on the federal government for home loans, for your health care, for your education, for your jobs, even for the kind of lightbulb that you want to put in the fixture, is not the aspirations of a free people.  And because of that, we are on the right side of this argument.  Everything that we're discussing here affects every..."
181,"MR. GREGORY:  What--but hold on, Congresswoman.  What did freedom get the American people during--that led to the financial collapse?  Is that not a fair question about the limits of, of the free capitalist system? "
182,"REP. BLACKBURN:  We know, we know that if you let free markets work--there is no expiration date on the free market.  There is no expiration date on the American economy.  What the American people do not like is the overreach of government, and they are seeing it time and
again. "
183,"MR. GREGORY:  I'm sorry, Congresswoman, my question was what did the free, what did the free market get us, what did freedom get us in the economic collapse?  You had an absence of government regulation, and you had the free market running wild.  Look what the result was."
184,"REP. BLACKBURN:  And you need, and you need more oversight.  We all agree
with that."
185,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
186,"REP. BLACKBURN:  And the financial bill that Senator Corker and them are working on would lead to more oversight.  The Goldman charges that have come forward now, David, they have come forward under existing SEC rules."
187,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
188,"REP. BLACKBURN:  More oversight, which I have always been a proponent of, would have helped us with this."
189,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let me just move on for a second.  I want to--I'm going to--I want to get another piece of this in here, José, which is the tea party movement.  It was just tax day, a big tea party rally on the mall here in Washington, and tea party rallies across the country. The
focus here, taxes, spending, the deficit."
190,REP. BLACKBURN:  Right.
191,"MR. GREGORY:  The question is, what is the political impact of the tea party come fall?  Ron Fournier writing for the Associated Press wrote this:  ""The tea party's making a lot of noise, but the angry-at-government movement has yet to establish itself as a force that can determine the outcome of November's congressional elections.  The key could be forging alliances with GOP candidates, but tea partiers in nearly every state are leery of that if not downright opposed.  `The day there's an organized tea party in Wisconsin,' says Mark Block, who runs tea party rallies in the state, `is the day the tea party movement dies.'"""
192,"Politico did some exit polling after the, the rally that we just showed you in Washington on Thursday, and a couple of interesting views of what tea partiers at this particular rally believe.  Seventy-five percent scared about the direction of the country, 73 percent want to send a
message to both parties. And then look at this, in terms of views of President Obama himself, 76 percent agree that Barack Obama's ""pursuing a socialist agenda."" What's the impact?"
193,"MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  Yeah.  I don't think a lot of people, for example, in the Hispanic community, to be very specific, think that Barack Obama's a socialist.  I do tell you this, that there is a lot of anger and rejection after what Washington's been doing.  And I think that this feeling that we sense throughout the country is the exact same feeling that I'm sensing in my community.  They are sick and tired of government taking them for granted. And politicians owe their jobs to our votes and they've gotten them, and now it's time for them to say, ""This is what
we're doing for you--not for us, not for the big corporations, and not for government."""
194,"MR. GREGORY:  I, I should say that, that poll from Politico will be available in its entirety on Monday at politico.com. "
195,Speak to that.
196,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Yeah.  I--well, I'm going to say, when the congresswoman said this election is going to be about liberty, there is probably about 40 percent of the electorate for whom this election is about liberty. And one of the things we know is that there is going to be a big turnout of conservatives who are antagonized and animated by what the Obama administration has been doing.  But for most of the electorate, this election is going to be about results.  And that's why even though I said that the Republicans have won the economic debate, I think, over the past year, there are more rounds left in this fight.  What the administration is hoping is that there will be enough good news of the sort that Secretary Geithner was talking about that by November they can make the case that ""Look, things have been tough, but we are beginning to move the economy in the right direction.  And do you want to go back?"" Because there is a tremendous amount of overlap between the policies that
Republicans are advocating now and those that were implemented by Bush, George W. Bush, during his two terms that produced, you know, one quarter as many jobs as under the eight years as Clinton and a decline in the median income over a two terms of a president, which we haven't seen for any other two-term president in modern times.  So even though I think 
Republicans, all the polls suggest that amid these hard times, because they have, I think, had the upper hand, the argument isn't over.  And, and there are beginning to be some positive economic signs that I think Obama is going to be able to marshal to argue that even if times are still tough, at least he has, he has begun to turn the corner."
197,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, Governor, let's take a case of--a real-live case of potential tea party impact, the Senate race down in Kentucky. Congressman--your district there on the line with Kentucky.  There you've got Trey Grayson seen as more of the establishment candidate endorsed by Mitch McConnell and Dick Cheney, the former vice president.  He is the
secretary of state.  And Rand Paul is the opponent.  He's an eye surgeon, he's the son of Ron Paul, the former presidential candidate.  He's been endorsed by Sarah Palin and Jim Bunning.  He's actually ahead in the primary race.  This is going to be a test for whether a tea party
sentiment or movement has real political power."
198,"GOV. RENDELL:  I think, David, the first thing that we have to define is, well, what's the tea party itself?  If you say it's the anger that people feel about the economy, etc., that's giving the tea party too much credit.  We had two recent tea party demonstrations in Washington.
One, a week before the healthcare vote, drew about a thousand people. The tax day rally by the organizer's own estimate was 1,500 people.  If I organized a rally for stronger laws to protect puppies, I would get 100,000 people to Washington.  So let's--I think the media has blown the tea party themselves out of proportion. That's number one.  Well, and what about those attendance figures?  Secondly, secondly..."
199,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We'll let you respond to that in a minute.
200,"GOV. RENDELL:  Secondly, there is anger out there at Washington, at Wall Street, and it's anger that's justified.  We, the American people, were handed a bad deal by Wall Street.  Washington didn't do it..."
201,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Well, you may diminish the tea party, but there's a real thing here, whether there's the culture wars being replaced by the government wars, and people really angry about whether government can manage its own affairs when a lot of governments are broke around the country, and whether it can really deliver on whether, you know, competently fight wars, protect the American people, do these kind of things.  I mean, this, this is a driving sentiment, is it not, Congresswoman?"
202,"REP. BLACKBURN:  Yes.  Tea parties are very loosely knit organizations. I describe it as kind of like an amoeba the way that they work, Governor. And if you came with me to one of the tea parties, what you would see is bill-paying moms and dads who are hardworking, and they finally have said, ""You know, we are going to do something about this."" The nation is on the right track.  And it's not just directed at the president or this administration or this leadership, it's directed at both parties.  What they want is leaders who are going to say, ""Look, you may not agree with us.  We're going to tell you the truth.  We're going to tell you where we stand.  We're going to stop spending taxpayer dollars on programs you don't want."" People know they're overtaxed and government says...(unintelligible)."
203,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about, let me ask you about some of the sentiments, though."
204,REP. BLACKBURN:  Yeah.
205,"MR. GREGORY:  Because we--earlier, we talked about this view that Barack Obama is a socialist.  Michele Bachmann, who is a colleague of yours in the House, from Minnesota, was at that tea party rally on Thursday, and she talked about that anti-government sentiment, and this is one of the things she had to say:"
206,"(Videotape, Thursday)"
207,REP. MICHELE BACHMANN (R-MN):  We're on to them!  We're on to this gangster government.
208,(End videotape)
209,"MR. GREGORY:  Gangster government, Congresswoman."
210,GOV. RENDELL:  It's disgusting.  Disgraceful.
211,"MR. GREGORY:  Are those, are those views that you would stand behind, that kind of rhetoric?"
212,"REP. BLACKBURN:  You know, I choose a different rhetoric, and I choose to address this--to address the issues a little bit differently, David.  But I am very concerned about..."
213,"MR. GREGORY:  But, are--so listen, is that over the line?  Because it's--that's important.  I mean, this is a rally, this a politician.  Is that over the line?"
214,"REP. BLACKBURN:  Those are, those are words that she chose in statements that she made.  What we have to focus on is tea party individuals. Individuals who are activists, who are coming to these tea parties are very, very, very concerned about what is happening with this country. They know that their taxes are high; they know that government has overspent.  They're not looking at government today.  They're looking at what's going to happen 20, 30, 50 years from now with our unfunded liabilities."
215,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Congresswoman, is that--do these kinds of words, we are--April 19th is coming up, is the anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, where an anti-government, you know, person, who was arguably a sociopath..."
216,REP. BLACKBURN:  Absolutely. 
217,"MR. GREGORY:  ...attacked the federal government.  When you describe a gangster government, do you think that's over the line and inappropriate in our political discourse?"
218,REP. BLACKBURN:  It would not have been a choice in words that I made.
219,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
220,"REP. BLACKBURN:  And what we have to realize is anytime you have large public gatherings, whether it is a group from the left or the group from the right, you're going to have lots of individuals with different opinions that show up."
221,"MR. GREGORY:  José, let me get you into this.  Broader perspective here, then, in terms of the, the overall impact of this kind of discourse right now. I mean, it says something about what's resonating... "
222,MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  Yeah.
223,"MR. GREGORY:  ...for some people in the country in terms of their views of what Washington is doing, right or wrong."
224,"MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  Can I interrupt you, David..."
225,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
226,"MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  ...because there's something that's resonating in our community that I don't hear enough about here, and I thank you for the opportunity.  Immigration reform.  Immigration reform is fundamental for the Hispanic community.  Let me tell you something.  You don't have to be an undocumented alien or an illegal immigrant, however you want to call them, to want immigration reform in this country.  It's something that everybody in the Hispanic community is asking for.  And we want to know what the conservatives and what the liberals and what the tea party and what the Democrats are thinking and saying.  Because you know what, words do matter.  And I've got President Obama, 19--in 2008, saying, ""I can guarantee you we will have an immigration reform proposal during my first year."" Words matter, we haven't seen it.  Then we have on the right, people that trash Hispanics by saying, for example, that Hispanic--what we see in Arizona, what we're seeing in Arizona, for example, that, that if you look like you could be an illegal worker, you could be..."
227,GOV. RENDELL:  Who are these...
228,"MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  Well, yeah, but both sides.  Both sides have..."
229,GOV. RENDELL:  Who are those people out there trashing...
230,"REP. BLACKBURN:  Yes, yes."
231,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  You know, one thing to keep in mind about the tea party is that it is an overwhelmingly white movement."
232,"MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  You talking, you talking about immigration reform right
now?"
233,MR. BROWNSTEIN:  And about the tea--no.
234,"MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  OK, because that's what I wanted to bring up."
235,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Tea party, the tea party--yeah, talking about the tea party in general is overwhelmingly white.  John McCain, almost 90 percent of his votes in 2008 came from whites.  We are living through a fundamental demographic change.  Hispanics were 2 percent of the vote when Bill Clinton first got elected, they were 9 percent of the vote in 2008."
236,MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  That's right.
237,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  And not only is their absolute number growing, they're dispersing.  It's not only in Miami, Phoenix, LA anymore.  There are now 99 congressional districts in which at least 20 percent of the vote is Hispanic. And one of the questions I think the Republican Party faces is not only on immigration but, more broadly, on the role of government. The nonwhite community, the Hispanic community, the African-American community, is much more open to an activist role for government. "
238,MR. GREGORY:  I think you're right.
239,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Thirty percent of Hispanics do not have health insurance, 30 percent, and that..."
240,"MR. GREGORY:  So let me, though..."
241,"MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  When we focused on immigration, and all of a sudden..."
242,"MR. GREGORY:  But, José...."
243,"MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  I'm sorry, it's just that it never gets talked about. Can we focus on it for a second?"
244,REP. BLACKBURN:  I want to go back to it at some point.
245,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Hey, I'm..."
246,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, hold on.  We're talking about it."
247,MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  I know you are.
248,MR. GREGORY:  OK.  But my point about immigration reform.
249,MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  Yeah.
250,MR. GREGORY:  How much of this has been sidelined by all of the concentration on health care?
251,"MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  That's exactly right, and that's the question we're asking on, on ""Enfoque"" today, later on Telemundo.  A gentleman from Casa de Maryland, who was meeting with President Obama at the White House on the afternoon where they were talking about immigration reform, and at that same time, they were picking people up in different places in...(unintelligible)...or you know, they pick them up for deportation, says that.  He says, ""We understand that he's got other priorities.  But when you promise something, you have to at least deal with it."""
252,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  But, but how can we..."
253,REP. BLACKBURN:  They...
254,MR. BROWNSTEIN:  ...how can you argue that health insurance reform is not a significant priority?
255,MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  I'm not arguing that.
256,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  If 30 percent of the Hispanic community, according to the census..."
257,"MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  Sure, you're absolutely right."
258,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  ...lacks health insurance, much more than--double the
share among whites."
259,MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  You're absolutely right.
260,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  So, I mean, in terms of a material impact on the Hispanic community, it's hard to think of anything that could be more direct than that. Now, the issue of whether immigration reform comes up, Harry Reid has said in the last few weeks he does intend to bring a bill to the floor."
261,MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  Right.
262,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Unlikely to have 60 votes to get through in this kind of quasi-parliamentary, parliamentary system without majority rule that we live in.  But certainly no community had more of a stake.  And if you look at the polling, Hispanics are much more likely than whites to say that healthcare reform will personally benefit me and my family."
263,MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  Why are those things...
264,MR. GREGORY:  Final words.
265,MR. BROWNSTEIN:  They're not incompatible.
266,"MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  Yeah, they're not incompatible at all."
267,MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Right.  But...
268,MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  I don't know why we can't talk about them...
269,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  No, I'm just saying..."
270,MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  ...at the same time.
271,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  ...that to say that, to say that the Hispanic community
was ill-served by putting health care in front of immigration reform, I
think, is..."
272,REP. BLACKBURN:  I was...
273,MR. DÍAZ-BALART:  (Unintelligible)
274,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  I'm going to have to make, I'm going to have to make that the last word.  There's so much more to discuss, but we're out of time.  Thank you all very much."
275,"We're going to have more with José, the soft-spoken José, about his new program and important issues facing the Hispanic community in the U.S. and around the world in our MEET THE PRESS Take Two Web extra.  It's on our Web site this afternoon at mtp.msnbc.com."
276,"Up next, our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE.  President Obama defends his new plans for NASA this week.  We look back nearly a half a century ago to a very similar debate on the race to space with Colonel John Glenn, right after this brief station break."
277,(Announcements)
278,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  And we're back.  President Obama visited the Kennedy Space Center this week to defend his decision to revamp American's space program.  His ideas included sending an astronaut to an asteroid by 2025, while at the same time ending government-funded missions to the moon. Critics accused the president of shortchanging NASA, which they fear could undermine the country's competitive edge in space.  Questions over funding the space agency and the need for space exploration were also raised at the dawn of the space race when astronaut John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, appeared right here on MEET THE PRESS in 1963."
279,"(Videotape, April 21, 1963)"
280,"MR. LAWRENCE SPIVAK:  Colonel, as you know, there's a growing controversy in and out of Congress over the question of whether it is really worth the time and the money, the $20 billion to $40 billion to get a man to the moon.  Have you ever had any doubts about the importance of getting to the moon?"
281,"COL.  JOHN GLENN:  I don't think we know really until the exploration is completed whether it's going to be completely worthwhile or not.  I, I certainly think it will be, but I don't think we can really pinpoint every answer until we complete the exploration."
282,MR. SPIVAK:  You risked your life and you've devoted your energy and your time in this race to get to the moon.  Are you yourself convinced beyond question that it's worth doing and why?
283,"COL.  GLENN:  Well, yes, I, I am or I wouldn't be in the position I'm in."
284,(End videotape)
285,"MR. GREGORY:  On July 16th, 1969 Apollo 11 hurtled toward the sky.  Four days later Neil Armstrong, followed by Buzz Aldrin became the first men to set foot on the moon.  Aldrin traveled with President Obama Thursday to show support for the administration's new plans, while his fellow astronaut Armstrong has remained one of the administration's most vocal
critics."

1,(Videotape)
2,PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  A free market is never meant to be a free license to take whatever you can get however you can get it.
3,(End videotape)
4,"MR. GREGORY:  ...Washington vs. Wall Street.  Is a deal near on financial reform or is it the healthcare debate all over again?  What will pass and what will it really mean to how the financial system works in America? We'll ask the two men trying to shape an agreement, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, Democratic Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama."
5,"Then, the growing political divide, Arizona's Republican governor signs the nation's toughest immigration law, but President Obama calls it misguided."
6,"Plus, populist anger against Wall Street as the CEO of Goldman Sachs prepares to face questions on Capitol Hill this week and at the same time deepening distrust of government's role in the economy.  How will voters sort it out in November?  Our roundtable weighs in:  The New York Times' David Brooks, CNBC's Erin Burnett, NPR's Michele Norris, and Newsweek's Evan Thomas."
7,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  But first, an exclusive interview with the two men at the center of the debate over financial reform, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Chris Dodd and Senator Richard Shelby."
8,"Welcome, both of you, back to MEET THE PRESS."
9,SEN. CHRIS DODD (D-CT):  Thank you.
10,"SEN. RICHARD SHELBY (R-AL):  Thank you, David."
11,MR. GREGORY:  Good to have you here.  This is high noon for financial reform.
12,"So, Senator Dodd, the big question is do you have a deal?"
13,"SEN. DODD:  Well, Richard and I spent a lot of time together over the last year and--working on this bill, and we're getting there.  We're close; we've got some more work to do.  We're going to be meeting, I think, later today, in fact, to talk about it.  We're not there yet, but I would hope that, that we could the votes tomorrow on--when we have this motion to proceed to the bill to start the debate.  And, again, I think Richard and I have a pretty good understanding of where we are on these matters.  We can't take care of everything in the bill.  Obviously, our colleagues are going to want to be heard.  But we've been through an awful lot now.  We've lost almost $11 trillion of household wealth in the last 17 or 18 months, seven million homes in foreclosure, eight and a half million jobs have been lost, retirement incomes have declined by 20 percent, housing values declined by 30 percent, this morning's news obviously about Goldman Sachs.  Here we are 17 months after someone broke into our house, in effect, and robbed us, and we still haven't even changed the locks on the doors, and we need to get it done."
14,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, Senator Shelby, I mentioned this is high noon, you've got Democrats saying, ""This is it.  You're either with us or against us."" OK? You've got Senator Reid on--talking on Capitol Hill on Thursday saying this:"

HARRY REID (D-NV):  We have--we worked for more than, more than two months with Shelby trying to come up with something.  We worked for over a month trying to come up with something with Corker.  Now, this is very simple, if they're willing to go forward with reform, that's, that's what we'll do; but I'm not going to waste anymore time of the American people until they come up with some agreement. "
17,(End videotape)
18,MR. GREGORY:  So is there something Republicans can vote for here? 
19,"SEN. SHELBY:  Not yet, but we're getting there.  Like Senator Dodd said, we--we're working closely together.  I think we're conceptually very, very close.  This is a very complicated piece of legislation, over 1,300 pages as the Dodd bill now stands.  But we're--what we're trying to do is improve two or three things in it.  It's, it's very, very tedious.  We're going to continue to work today, as Senator Dodd said.  I think we're closer than we've ever been.  And will we get a bill by tomorrow?  I, I doubt it.  I would always hope so because there's so, so much  involved. But I think we will get a bill.  If the Democrats want a bill and will give us some things that we think that are substantive in nature, like make the ""too big to fail,"" send a message that nothing is too big to fail in this country and tighten up the language.  There's some
flexibility in the language there that we're talking about is--and..."
20,MR. GREGORY:  But this is inches you're talking about.
21,"SEN. SHELBY:  Well--but inches sometimes are miles, but I'm hoping they're half-inches."
22,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  I want to go through some of the substance...
23,SEN. SHELBY:  Go ahead.
24,"MR. GREGORY:  ...that, that are sticking points, but I just want to nail down this point.  A vote goes down tomorrow to begin the debate.  Will Republicans try to block that or will they vote to let that go forward? "
25,"SEN. SHELBY:  Oh, I think that tomorrow that nothing happens between now and tomorrow, that the Democrats will not get cloture, but we'll continue to work. That's the first vote, we'll--don't know when there'll be another vote and so forth, but if Senator Dodd and I and our staff
continue to work, we can get a bill."
26,"MR. GREGORY:  But you, you heard what Senator Reid said.  Are the politics just too difficult for Republicans to stand in the way and to oppose reform?"
27,"SEN. SHELBY:  Oh, no.  Not, not the Dodd bill.  I think the Republicans sent a letter out as--what came out of the banking committee that 41 said they were going to oppose the legislation as it now stands.  Now, that doesn't mean that they're not encouraging me as the ranking Republican to continue to negotiate, because most people believe we can get a bill."
28,"MR. GREGORY:  OK.  I want to talk--before we get to some of the issues like ""too big to fail,"" bailouts--you may be getting a call of somebody who can make a deal here, we don't want to stand in the way of that, Senator.  But on the front page of The Washington Post today, more news about Goldman Sachs. They have denied wrongdoing, they're facing civil fraud charges.  But the headline had to do with some internal documents that were leaked from a Senate committee about internal discussions about the housing market.  We'll put it up on the screen.  This is how The Washington Post reports it this morning: ""As the U.S. housing market began its epic fall nearly three years ago, top executives at ... Goldman Sachs cheered the large financial gains the firm stood to make on certain bets it had placed, according to newly released documents.  The documents show that the firm's executives were celebrating earlier investments calculated to benefit if housing prices fell, a Senate investigative committee found.  ..."
29,"""Lawmakers said the internal e-mails, released Saturday by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, contradict what they said are Goldman's assertions that the bank was not trying to profit from the decline of the house market in 2007 and was merely seeking to protect itself if prices collapsed."" Isn't this what really fuels the anger at Wall Street?  That, in effect, you appear to have elements within a company betting against the market, betting against the economy to make money in a way that does not seem to create jobs or create commerce?"
30,"SEN. DODD:  Frank Rich in The New York Times this morning, and I may not quote him exactly, but I think he has it exactly right, and this is there's something terribly wrong about a system in a country of ours where you make billions of dollars by making nothing or producing nothing, but merely taking advantage of an economic situation.  Now, again, these investigations going on and the legal matters involve Goldman Sachs, and I suspect others will come as well, just heighten the point.  And again, I--Richard and I are working closely together.  This doesn't end the debate tomorrow; it begins the debate. And Richard and I both know, as Richard's a former chairman of the committee as well, you don't get resolution of matters ultimately until you're at the table and have to do so.  So I, I hope tomorrow we can get those votes.  We may not, but I hope we do because we need to move forward.  We only got about 40 or 50 legislative days left, David, in this session of Congress.  Can you imagine if we left town, tomorrow if another crisis occurred in the country, we're no better off than we were in the fall of 2008.  We have no cops on the beat, major sectors of our, of our economy are unregulated entirely.  We have all of this going on out there, could happen again, ""too big to fail"" could happen again if we don't change the law.  Richard and I agree on this point."
31,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, but let's stick to Goldman Sachs here.  Senator Shelby, you, you..."
32,SEN. SHELBY:  Can I say something about Goldman Sachs? 
33,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
34,"SEN. SHELBY:  First of all, from my perspective and, and the perspective of a lot of people in America, we've got to end once and for all the casino atmosphere of Wall Street where they're gambling, basically, on synthetic ideas and so forth."
35,SEN. DODD:  And with someone else's money.
36,"SEN. SHELBY:  And, and--with somebody else's money, putting banks and our whole banking system at risk and producing nothing."
37,"MR. GREGORY:  How--a lot of people in the public, though, they hear that kind of rhetoric and then they also look at the record of contributions from a firm like Goldman Sachs and the securities industry and investment industry.  Let's put up on the screen for the two of you and for President Obama as well what some of the contributions were from employees and family members.  For the president, you see over a million dollars just from Goldman, over--nearly 16 million in securities and investment industry.  And for both of you as well, significant amounts,
certainly, from the industry as a whole."
38,"Senator Dodd, how is that relevant?  How do you separate all of that out when you've got firms that have significant--making significant contributions to you?"
39,"SEN. DODD:  Well, again, look, as someone who's a strong supporter of public financing of federal elections, I think the system is deeply troubled.  But I also happen to believe that most members of Congress that I know don't sell their votes for contributions.  Now, what we do
see going on, putting aside the contributions, a story this morning, literally millions and millions are being spent on lobbyists, particularly in the last few weeks realizing this bill may actually get done, to try and stop the legislation from happening, want to kill this bill if they can, they like the status quo.  Richard and I share the goal of getting a bill done here.  We both understand the value and importance of it.  We just would like to get the debate going.  If we don't get the debate going..."
40,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  But, but, but, but there--people I talk to on Wall Street say that kind of rhetoric is totally over the top, that they want stringent regulation but that there are details that are very important that, frankly, a lot of senators and congressmen and women
don't understand because of their complexity and yet they're willing to just, because of this political atmosphere, pass sweeping regulation that could hurt competitiveness, that could send jobs overseas and all the, all the rest."
41,"SEN. DODD:  David, I was born at night but not last night.  With all due respect to those arguments, those are red herrings.  We understand the complexity of it, that's why we spent so long at this.  Richard and I have spent the last two years basically, 39 months, going through hearings, working at this, listening to people, countless conversations with experts in the field.  And there are some disagreements here.  Not on ""too big to fail."" We're going to shut that down forever.  We want consumers to get some protection.  We'd like an early warning system so we don't end up getting into trouble in the first place.  And then making sure that no financial institution's going to be unregulated in our country.  We won't...(unintelligible)."
42,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, Senator Shelby, let, let's talk about the issue of bailouts because this is really important.  You've heard Senator Dodd say this will guarantee no more taxpayer-funded bailouts.  The president, speaking on Wall Street on Thursday, made his case.  This is what he
said:"
43,"(Videotape, Thursday)"
44,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  What's not legitimate is to suggest that somehow the legislation being proposed is going to encourage future taxpayer bailouts, as some have claimed.  That makes for a good sound bite, but it's not factually accurate.  It is not true."
45,(End videotape)
46,"MR. GREGORY:  OK.  So what's the substance behind that argument? Secretary Timothy Geithner was on the program last week and I asked him specifically that question, how they could make that kind of guarantee, and he said what the bills would actually do substantively."
47,"(Videotape, April 18, 2010)"
48,"SEC'Y TIMOTHY GEITHNER:  They will make sure if a large institution ever again managed itself to the point where it can't survive on its own and it has to come for the government for support, then the government will put its in--put it into receivership, it will wipe out shareholders, it will replace management and board, and will make sure that we wind that firm down.  We dismember it.  We sell it off so it cannot exist again to make those kind of mistakes in the future."
49,(End videotape)
50,MR. GREGORY:  Senator Shelby?
51,"SEN. SHELBY:  That, that, that would be our goal, too..."
52,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
53,SEN. SHELBY:  ...to make sure that any failed institution is wound up. But this--the language in the Dodd bill doesn't say that.  It's not there yet. It's--we're tightening it up.  I believe that he will work with us. But...
54,"MR. GREGORY:  But let's get past some of the legislative speak.  What, what is it that is, is not there, you think, that still has taxpayers on the hook?"
55,"SEN. SHELBY:  Too, too much flexibility with the Fed and also with the FDIC. It's in..."
56,"MR. GREGORY:  In other words, the FDIC can get access to a lot more money."
57,SEN. SHELBY:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.
58,MR. GREGORY:  The Fed can issue loans.
59,SEN. SHELBY:  Absolutely.  And we need...
60,MR. GREGORY:  So the taxpayers still could be on the hook.
61,"SEN. SHELBY:  We need to tighten that up to make sure that it doesn't happen. The message should be, unambiguously, that nothing's too big to fail.  And if you fail, we're going to put you, put you to sleep."
62,"MR. GREGORY:  So, Senator Dodd, let me try to break that down a little bit. If the notion is that the government sees a firm taking excessive risks, they're looking through the window a little bit at how the business is being run, they may make comment, regulators saying, ""That's
excessive risk, you shouldn't do that.  That's systemic risk.  We're going to--you know, we're going to move in.  You have--brink of insolvency here.  You, you prefunded a fund that can pay for that, that banks would pay for, but there's still a lot of access to government cash that taxpayers pay for if they get in trouble and if they need more cash. "
63,"SEN. DODD:  Well, no.  First of all, even beginning before that, the systemic risk council just doesn't give advisory rules, they instruct the Fed with institutions that are engaging in excessive risk.  They can go so far as to break them up.  Now, that's a--an action of last resort."
64,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
65,"SEN. DODD:  But that power exists in our bill.  Now, regarding access to, to, to resources out of the Fed under that, that 13(3) provisions here, that is so tight here, in fact, we're down to the point of insisting that Congress be involved in determining whether not it can go forward.  We've never done that before.  So it, it's very, very tight, in our view.  And whether or not you have approval or disapproval, that's really the argument.  So this is very, very tight."
66,"MR. GREGORY:  But here's--but isn't the bigger question about the role of government here?  I mean, we had a lot of regulators on the job who missed what was going on.  We had warnings to the likes of the head of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, about the bubble in the housing market and impending collapse.  You have bureaucrats who work in the government, who, who warn about really big things that could happen.  There wasn't the political will or people didn't have the judgment to intervene the last time.  How is that different now?"
67,"SEN. DODD:  Well, because a couple of things.  First of all, we don't have unregulated--a lot of the problems occurred in the unregulated part of our economy.  Richard Shelby and I are not going to allow that to happen again. There's every financial--major financial service is going
to be potentially--or regulated under this bill.  Secondly, you're going to put resources to work here, put cops on the beat watching all of this, stopping too big to fail.  Consumer protection is a major part of this bill.  In the past we didn't watch out for consumers.  Safety and
soundness is critically important, but what happens with credit cards and mortgages, people lured into arrangements they knew they could never afford..."
68,MR. GREGORY:  But there...
69,SEN. DODD:  ...people who would allow that to happen?
70,MR. GREGORY:  ...there's still the same question:  Is the government up to this job of regulation when it hasn't proven to be...
71,"SEN. SHELBY:  That, that's an excellent question.  They haven't been. The regulators failed us.  The Fed, all the regulators failed the American people. The question is, will they--what have they learned?  We hope they've learned a lot.  We should never go back to 18 months ago when we're--everything was at risk.  Now, what we're trying to do is tighten this language to make sure there's just not so much flexibility for the regulators to go back again."
72,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let me challenge, then, you on a point then."
73,SEN. SHELBY:  OK.
74,"MR. GREGORY:  If the, if the, if the, if the complaint is government's not up to it, we had regulators before, can they do it this time, and we're so worried about bailouts, look at the track record of bailouts so far.  The president was boasting yesterday that GM and Chrysler have paid off their debts, not completely, but, but, but way ahead of schedule. TARP is now $186 billion back.  The overall payment is supposed to be around $87 billion.  The record's been pretty good that the government's and the taxpayer have done OK so far in bailouts, have they not?"
75,"SEN. SHELBY:  First of all, the payback by General Motors and Chrysler will never happen, not all of it.  That's misleading, even what the president said there.  And they paid back some money that they were already given by the TARP money.  They haven't paid back the other, and they won't.  Some of the banks have paid back the money, and that's good. But we should never go down that road again.  If the regulators do their job and if we tighten this legislation, we won't have to visit it again."
76,"SEN. DODD:  Let me--I'm going to go back to your previous question for a second, David, because I think it's important.  What we're trying to do is put--make sure what happened can never happen again, provide the tools--there'll be another economic crisis, it's silly for us to argue otherwise.  The question was, will we have the tools to respond to it before it gets so out of hand it puts our entire economic system at risk,  with the job losses and all the other items I mentioned?  But thirdly, our goal here is we don't want to so strangle a system that we can't create jobs, have credit flow and capital form to benefit--and to lead the world.  What happened in Greece ought to remind us, it's not just locally--domestically located where problems can occur.  There was a failure in the Shanghai Exchange a few years ago that represented less than 5 percent of the volume of the New York Stock Exchange.  It declined
by 12 points.  Around the world, within about 24 hours, markets reacted to this.  We're in a global economy.  The United States needs to lead on financial services.  That's also part of our goal in this bill."
77,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but isn't this still the central question, that you're trying to manage the downside instead of trying to prevent it beforehand? In other words, who, who is it in the government who's going to call the head of a major multinational bank and say, ""We've been watching.  You're taking too much risk, and this is potentially systemic risk.  We""--who, who is going to do that?"
78,"SEN. DODD:  Well, what Richard, Richard and I do in this bill, I think we agree on this point, the systemic risk council is made up of the prudential regulators, chaired by the secretary of the Treasury with, with a vice chair by--out of Federal Reserve, with a team of also collecting data in real time. This is something that Bob Corker and Mark Warner insisted in our bill.  It's a very good provision.  Real-time data so we know on a daily basis what's happening, rather than waiting for some good investigative reporter to point out something.  So you watch these either by product line or by institution getting so large, so  interconnected it puts us at risk.  That's a great advantage this bill has that we don't have today."
79,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet, Senator Shelby, there are Democrats who are saying if you want to prevent ""too big to fail,"" don't allow banks to get too big.  Do some of the biggest banks responsible for so much money in, in the country, should they be broken up?"
80,"SEN. SHELBY:  Well, that's a, a good question, and that's one that Dr. Volcker's talked about for years.  And he says if you're too big to regulate, maybe you're too big to, to exist, in other words, because you will cause systemic risk.  Being big, in my judgment, is not necessarily
bad.  But it's bad, bad when the perception is that the big is going to be bailed out and the small are going to be gobbled up by the regulators. "
81,MR. GREGORY:  But you're--so you're not for that.
82,SEN. SHELBY:  I'm not for it per se.
83,MR. GREGORY:  You don't see a need for it.
84,"SEN. SHELBY:  But I do believe that any regulator ought to have the power, if they see a bank is getting so risky and into things and maybe so big, and if they don't have the capital and they don't have the management, to make them do things, whatever it is, is shrink or whatever."
85,MR. GREGORY:  You think banks should be broken up?
86,"SEN. DODD:  Well, I, I--Richard and I sort of agree on this point. I--it's the regulation of these institutions and what they're doing, and whether or not they're able to conduct and engage in excessive risk at our expense. That's why the Volcker rule is important."
87,"MR. GREGORY:  Right, you guy--so the Volcker rule would say to the banks, ""There's certain things you can't do,"" what they call proprietary trading, to..."
88,SEN. DODD:  Gambling with my money.
89,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
90,"SEN. DODD:  With low interest rates.  Having, having their banks or holding companies..."
91,MR. GREGORY:  What would it actually mean?  Because a lot of people on Wall Street say you guys can't even define exactly what it would mean. 
92,"SEN. DODD:  Well, they can't start--they can't be engaging in hedge funds and venture capital and these kind of risky, overly risky behaviors."
93,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But, you know, I--in some of my research, I read in 2007 that you, you wanted to make sure that hedge funds could still prosper in the country."
94,SEN. DODD:  I'm not opposed to hedge funds prospering.  I want them registered.  I want to know what they're doing so they're not putting us at risk.
95,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
96,"SEN. DODD:  This is the point, striking this balance.  You're going to have David Brooks on in your panel in a few minutes.  David's written about trying to strike this balance, and he's right.  We do need to have good cops on the beat doing a good job so we don't allow this stuff to
get out of hand."
97,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
98,"SEN. DODD:  But simultaneously, not to stifle the innovation and creativity that have been the source of our great success as a country. "
99,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Final point on this, just quickly from both of you. What, in the end--so people are really clear on this--what, in the end, is going to pass?"
100,SEN. DODD:  The Dodd bill.
101,MR. GREGORY:  So the top three points are?
102,"SEN. DODD:  The Dodd bill:  ""too big to fail,"" put an end to it; good consumer protection, early warning system, and shining the light on these exotic instruments.  We didn't talk much about the derivatives, the, the over-the-counter..."
103,MR. GREGORY:  Our bets on a financial outcome in the future.
104,"SEN. DODD:  Yeah.  Went from $91 billion to $591 billion in 10 years.  It was, it was the Wild West.  We've got to stop it.  You got to..."
105,MR. GREGORY:  Do you...
106,SEN. DODD:  That was...(unintelligible).  Those are the four points.
107,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you fundamentally agree, those, those several points, that that's what will pass?"
108,"SEN. SHELBY:  I don't believe the Dodd bill as now constituted will pass. Now, it might be the Dodd bill as we rework it, which we're, we're doing. Which we're doing..."
109,SEN. DODD:  Dodd-Shelby bill.  Dodd-Shelby bill.
110,"SEN. SHELBY:  ...we--as we're doing, will--I hope will pass."
111,"MR. GREGORY:  In the end, do you think you're a yes vote as you sit here today?"
112,SEN. SHELBY:  Only for a substantive good bill.  Not for the bill that exists.  I'd be a yes vote if it's a good bill. 
113,MR. GREGORY:  And you think you'll get there?
114,SEN. SHELBY:  I think we'll get there.
115,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
116,"I want to add something, a couple, a couple, this immigration debate..."
117,SEN. SHELBY:  Yeah.
118,"MR. GREGORY:  ...is now really flaring anew because of this law in Arizona. The president said that the Justice Department will take a look at.  And now, Senator Dodd, you see immigration reform by the Democrats is going to be on the front burner.  What is the, the, the impact then of the Arizona law on the debate that we'll see take place?"
119,"SEN. DODD:  Well, only this much, I think.  And putting us--I mean, I think Arizona law is outrageous, the idea that we go around asking people for documentation and put you in jail if you don't have it.  The idea that state by state would start developing its own immigration laws in the country, imagine what a patchwork that might look like.  Last year 48 states passed 222 resolutions and like 140--220 laws and 140 resolutions on the issue of immigration.  This is a--it's demanding a national answer to immigration policy.  So before this even gets further out of hand, we've got to step up and do the job."
120,"SEN. SHELBY:  Well, I agree with that.  States are frustrated.  People are frustrated because they believe that the federal government, the immigration people, have not enforced the laws.  We have 12, 15 million illegal immigrants in this country.  You say why?  So I think that begets
what's going on in Arizona."
121,MR. GREGORY:  You think youll see comprehensive immigration reform legislation passed this year?
122,"SEN. SHELBY:  Maybe.  We've seen it before, but it hasn't passed."
123,MR. GREGORY:  You think it'd be a good idea?
124,SEN. SHELBY:  I think we have to look at the details.
125,"MR. GREGORY:  But it's the right time, is your view?"
126,"SEN. SHELBY:  Well, timing is now.  I think the first thing we better do is enforce our, our borders and know who's here and who comes and who leaves. That's number one, and then go into the rest. "
127,"MR. GREGORY:  Finally, Senator Dodd, the political outlook for your party in the fall.  You're not running."
128,SEN. DODD:  Yes.
129,"MR. GREGORY:  Is President Obama an asset or a liability, and what do you, what do you project for the Democrats in the fall?"
130,"SEN. DODD:  Oh, I think he's an asset, without any question.  I think the--getting the healthcare bill done, the arms control agreement with, with Russia.  The country's getting--we're better off.  We're obviously moving in the right direction economically.  A lot has not happened yet on Main Street with high unemployment and the rest, but certainly the worst is behind us. He's showing real leadership.  Richard and I are going to get this bill on financial reform with colleagues.  That's going to be a major achievement for our country.  I, I think having the president on your side is going to be a great asset."
131,"MR. GREGORY:  OK.  When do you think you'll have a deal done on this, by the way?"
132,"SEN. DODD:  I think in the, the next few days, weeks, we'll get it together, maybe even, maybe even by tomorrow possibility get this done. We need to get on with this."
133,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
134,"SEN. DODD:  I, I, we spent a whole week last week on five nominations in the Senate, all of whom were confirmed almost unanimously."
135,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Final word.
136,"SEN. SHELBY:  I think if we keep working together, we'll get a bill.  It might be later this week.  It may mean a night, might be next week.  But the main thing is to get a good bill."
137,SEN. DODD:  Yeah.  I agree with that.
138,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, Senators, we'll leave it there."
139,SEN. DODD:  Thank you.
140,SEN. SHELBY:  Thank you.
141,MR. GREGORY:  Thank you both very much.
142,SEN. DODD:  Thank you.
143,MR. GREGORY:  Appreciate it.

158,"MR. DAVID BROOKS:  Right.  First of all, I think this bill in Arizona is an invitation to abuse.  You're going to have the government making decisions on the basis of race.  And at what level are they making these decisions?  At the cop level, in the worst possible circumstances, when
people are angry?  It's an invitation to sort of racial profiling and abuse.  So I think it's terrible.  But the worst effect is happening back here because now we have the Democrats promising to have a comprehensive immigration bill before any of the preparatory work has been done,
pushing aside a lot of other stuff, like cap and trade and energy.  And why are they doing it?  For purely political reasons because a lot of Democrats, including Harry Reid who is trying to get re-elected in Nevada, need to really fire up Latino voters to get them to come out to
the polls."
159,"MR. GREGORY:  And to that point, Michele Norris, this was how The Hill reported the political pressure on Democrats, in the White House and in Congress.  Here it was.  ""A congressman from the president's home state is threatening that he will urge Latino voters to stay home this November if the party does not make a concerted effort to pass comprehensive immigration reform."""
160,"Representative Gutierrez, ""arguably one of President Obama's biggest Democratic critics in Congress.  ...  He's strongly criticized the administration's policy on deportation and questioned its commitment to far-reaching reform."
161,"""Some Democrats have felt little urgency in pursuing the controversial issue,"" partially because--partially--""partly because they see no risk that Hispanic voters will bolt the party for the GOP.  But Gutierrez says they're missing the real political consequence of inaction."
162,"""`We can stay home,' Gutierrez said in an interview with The Hill.  `We can say, ""You know what?  There is a third option:  We can refuse to participate.""'"" That would hurt Democrats."
163,"MS. MICHELE NORRIS:  That would hurt Democrats and that would make people in, in, in the DNC crazy because they had made significant inroads in the--among Hispanic voters this year..."
164,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
165,"MS. NORRIS:  ...in, in the presidential election.  You know, I, I think when push comes to shove, I doubt that the representative will be making that kind of claim and pushing people to stay home.  I mean, David is right, though, that this is going to create a real problem.  And if you actually look at what's going on in Arizona and if you spent some time talking to the police chiefs in Arizona who are actually going to be, you know, forced to make these calls, they're really uncomfortable with this. I mean, there are some basic questions that haven't been answered.  How do you define someone who is said to be suspected of being in this
country illegally?  You know, does that just include someone who happens to speak--be speaking Spanish?  Does that include the, the British student who overstayed their visa?  Does that include the, the Irish pub worker who, you know, is, is here on a tourist visa?  There's a lot of discomfort in this."
166,"MR. GREGORY:  But the, but the, but the argument, Evan, from the governor is, look, you're going to be in a situation where if somebody's being investigated for a crime, then you can ask for documentation.  It's not as if they're just going to be pulling--I mean it's--the argument is they would not be pulling people over because they look like they could be an illegal immigrant."
167,"MR. EVAN THOMAS:  Well, she says no racial profiling, but what do you think is really going to happen here?"
168,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
169,"MR. THOMAS:  Racial profiling.  It's--I--if you leave individual police, however well-intentioned they are, they're going to be in situations where they're--it's going to create abuses.  I think it's without, without question. The issue is how quickly it will get to the courts.  I think it's going to get struck down because it's going to be applied in some very abusive way.  But, in the meantime, it's polarizing and chaotic."
170,"MR. GREGORY:  You have--you--Erin, a debate over the merits of this, whether there should be comprehensive reform.  Senator Mitch McConnell is saying the time is not right to pursue this kind of reform.  And you heard Senator Shelby say, well, maybe it might be right.  What's
interesting for Democrats is do they want immigration reform when, if you have a lot more people who are here legally, that could have an impact on healthcare reform.  If you're trying to make the numbers work and you have all these people who could get additional health insurance benefits from the government, doesn't that make it hard to rein in costs?"
171,"MS. ERIN BURNETT:  Oh, it certainly does.  I mean, it comes right to the heart of the healthcare issue.  I mean, when you look at the numbers here, what are the numbers we always hear, 20 million people are in this country illegally and that would, according to a lot of insurance executives, that's really the lion's share of the, the people who are currently uninsured.  So there is a clear link to be made on that front. In terms of the, the other side of this, I would say just from the business perspective you would expect real pushback on a bill like this from business.  They want more immigration, but what's interesting is that you're talking about doing this in a state where your, your problem is Hispanic immigration.  You're not going to get a lot of business support to fight against that, the immigrants that they want in the country are the Indian immigrant, the Chinese immigrants, Korean immigrants.  That's where you get a fight.  But, but you're going to--you're not going to get a big push on the business side to try to protect Hispanic immigrants."
172,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Evan, look at the politics of this, Senator John McCain came out in support of the governor's bill.  This was the same Senator McCain who with Senator Kennedy fought for comprehensive immigration reform.  It says something about the political mood and the landscape politically of the country."
173,"MR. THOMAS:  It makes me sad.  I mean, McCain..."
174,"MR. GREGORY:  He's facing a tough primary fight, I understand."
175,"MR. THOMAS:  And I'm sympathetic for that, a politician's got to get re-elected.  But this was a guy who really knew how to get to the center and to reach across the aisle, and he came close a few years ago in getting this done.  Now here he is pandering like crazy to get himself
re-elected and endorsing a bad bill.  I--people who know McCain are disappointed by him.  I mean, you understand, he's a politician, but really."
176,"MR. GREGORY:  Let, let--David Brooks, I want to talk--so the president's talking about taking on immigration reform, but let's also talk about financial reform.  And I want to talk about the president's approach to this, his performance through this and how it's different from some of
the other fights.  He went up to Wall Street, he had, he had talked about the fat-cat bankers in the past, he had gone after AIG bonuses and all the rest, and yet this is what he said in part on Thursday:"
177,"(Videotape, Thursday)"
178,"PRES. OBAMA:  I'm here today specifically when I speak to the titans of industry here because I want to urge you to join us instead of fighting us in this effort.  I am here--I'm here because I believe that these reforms are, in the end, not only in the best interests of our country but in the best interests of the financial sector."
179,(End videotape)
180,"MR. GREGORY:  Much different tone.  A senior White House official told me this week they felt a public flogging of Wall Street would have been counterproductive.  Take a step back and, and assess how the president has approached this as compared to different fights he's faced."
181,"MR. BROOKS:  Well, first of all, it's a different fight, but I think this is who he authentically is.  There's, there's always a temptation when Democrats are, are doing poorly in the polls, which they are now, to take the Huey Long route, to bash business and try to shin up some popular
support, but that's genuinely not who the president is.  You know, I have some arguments with my colleagues on the right, ""Is the guy a socialist?"" And I think if you look at the range of his behavior over this last 15, 16 months, he's a moderate, pragmatic liberal, but he is not a socialist. And his instinct, if you talk to him, or if you read his book, it's always ""on the one hand, on the other."" His mental formulation is always this and that, and it's always a balance in his mind.  And so that's why I may be six notches to the right of him but I still think he's always open to argument, he always wants to talk to people even if they're on Wall Street, and I think that's just the general temperament of the man, which has a very wonderful effect on curbing what would be, I think, a polarizing effect of a lot of presidents, even if you disagree with him on issue after issue."
182,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  And there are disagreements, Erin, on Wall Street in terms of his approach to financial regulation.  You heard Senator Shelby and Dodd.  What do you take away with in terms of what's actually going to be passed and what it's going to mean?"
183,"MS. BURNETT:  It, it--it's, it's a fascinating process I have to say.  My concern is that a couple of crucial things are not in this bill really at all. You raised one of them which is we had a lot of regulators and a lot of these institutions which failed--Lehman, Bear among them--were regulated.  So this bill says we're going to have more regulation and a council of regulators, but it doesn't necessarily deal with how we're going to get them to be smarter and better and more on the ball.  SEC has 3,700 employees and 35,000 regulated institutions, they're only going to get more as a result of this.  So it doesn't deal with that, and it doesn't deal with the ratings agencies which, of course, were at the core.  What it does try to do is say, ""When an institution fails, we're not going to put the taxpayers on the hook, and you are also right there in the court.  They haven't really solved how they're going to avoid
that.  They have a $50 billion number they're putting in this bill, the assets of the biggest bank in the country, Bank of America, are north of two trillion.  So the amount of what we're putting in and the substance of how we deal with it is, is not there yet."
184,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet, Michele, it's so interesting, here comes Goldman Sachs..."
185,MS. NORRIS:  Mm-hmm.
186,"MR. GREGORY:  ...and, and, and it strikes me that a lot of people dislike Goldman Sachs, and they really don't understand what Goldman Sachs does, but they just know that they dislike them."
187,MS. NORRIS:  Right.
188,"MR. GREGORY:  And then there are people who know what Goldman Sachs actually does, and they dislike them for different reasons."
189,MS. NORRIS:  Right.
190,MR. GREGORY:  And yet you have these e-mails come out today...
191,MS. NORRIS:  Mm-hmm.
192,"MR. GREGORY:  ...that, that talk about kind of celebrating the fact that they were betting against the housing market, sort of betting against the economy and making a lot of money.  This is a wholly different question from whether there was--whether the securities laws were violated in terms of some of those other matters that the SEC is looking at.  But what do they face as they come to Capitol Hill this week?"
193,"MS. NORRIS:  Oh, I, I, I..."
194,MR. GREGORY:  Lloyd Blankfein's going to testify.
195,"MS. NORRIS:  ...I, I, I think it's, it's--you know, it makes you think of the tobacco executives coming and raising their right hand and the auto executives coming and raising their right hand.  I think they're probably going to take a grilling, you know, in the Senate.  But more important than that, and that's, that's--they're going to take a, a grilling when they come to Capitol Hill, but they're--more importantly than that, the, the public..."
196,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
197,"MS. NORRIS:  ...as, you know, they're, they're held in very bad odor right now in, in, in many, many places.  And we talk about reform and what reform is, we're seeing in some ways, though, that the wheels of reform are already working in the, in the evidence that we see in the Goldman Sachs case.  I mean, this, this is evidence--the SEC for many years was outgunned.  They didn't understand the industries that they were supposed to regulate, and, in this case, they've created a new division.  They have someone--Robert Khuzami, who is..."
198,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
199,"MS. NORRIS:  ...is heading this division, who's, who's hired many people that will--that really now understand what goes on within places like Goldman Sachs.  He hired former executives and... "
200,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah."
201,MR. BROOKS:  I'd like to defend Goldman Sachs.
202,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
203,"MR. BROOKS:  I mean, we had a mania.  Everybody thought housing prices were going to go up forever.  Who was going to stop that?  Well, it wasn't the Fed, it wasn't the guys at Fannie and Freddie, it wasn't the great and the good, the people leading Citigroup and all those.  It was a bunch of arrogant scuzzballs who said, ""Everybody else in the world is a bunch of idiots.  I know better, I'm going to put a lot of money betting against that, betting against this bubble."" And they happened to be right and they happened to be intelligent."
204,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
205,"MR. BROOKS:  And they are scuzzballs, but frankly..."
206,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
207,"MR. BROOKS:  ...a lot of people who were going long on the market were scuzzballs, too."
208,MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Well...
209,MR. BROOKS:  And so...
210,"MR. GREGORY:  ...whether that's true or not, I mean..."
211,"MR. BROOKS:  ...they were, they were doing the right thing."
212,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.  And they--and you--to further that argument, the argument, Evan, is that, that they could--they thought the market was too hot. That's, that's the reason why you, you short the--I mean, Erin, you can correct me if I'm wrong and--because it's all written down here in this Journal of Derivatives that Erin Burnett brought to the program this morning. But they were shorting the market, betting against it because they thought it had gotten out of hand.  And--but it was a way to make money.  But the follow-up question is, is that good for society?  Are they creating wealth for anybody besides the firm?"
213,"MR. THOMAS:  The problem for Goldman is that they were once known for taking care of their clients, ""You come to Goldman, and we take care of you."" They evolved into more of a gambling casino, a very smart gambling casino..."
214,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
215,"MR. THOMAS:  ...as David said, they made some smart bets.  But the idea that they're not serving their client has crept in a way that makes it feel like they're playing everybody for suckers.  And I don't think that's entirely fair..."
216,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
217,"MR. THOMAS:  ...but the perception is that they got the inside information, you don't, you're the sucker where they're the smart guys and they're getting rich.  It's more complicated..."
218,"MS. NORRIS:  Yeah, but..."
219,"MR. GREGORY:  Let, let me just get a reaction from Erin, though, on
the..."
220,"MS. NORRIS:  ...what is, what is right..."
221,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
222,MS. NORRIS:  ...and what is good are two different things.
223,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
224,"MS. NORRIS:  And particularly in a, in a time where the banks came Washington, hat in hand, asked for bailouts, needed to be pumped up by the federal government.  Sure, they may have done the right thing.  They may--there may have been, you know, the smartest people in that universe in that room making smart decisions.  But was it good for the American economy?"
225,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to get Erin in on this, and I want to, I want to add Mayor Bloomberg from New York and his view on this.  He was--it's reported by the New York Post this week where he thinks this has gotten--this criticism has gotten out of hand.  ""[Mayor] Bloomberg, who's been critical of Democrats for trashing Wall Street to score political points, said the courts should determine whether Goldman is guilty of securities fraud.  He cautioned Democrats against trying to make too much political hay at the expense of Wall Street."
226,"""`Being an elected official, I think you have an obligation to do what you think is right, not what you think is politically popular at the time.'"" His concern is not only sales tax receipts and other kind of taxes that help New Yorkers in the city..."
227,MS. BURNETT:  Right.
228,"MR. GREGORY:  ...and in the state, but also America's competitiveness, whether you, you, you really make it open season on the banks and on derivatives and on credit default swap..."
229,MS. BURNETT:  Mm-hmm.  Right.
230,MR. GREGORY:  ...and that market will go overseas and the jobs will go with them.
231,"MS. BURNETT:  You know, they've made that argument before.  Now, some would say, ""Look, we've heard that before with hedge funds, and everyone was going to go to London,"" and they didn't.  And now they're saying if we regulate derivatives they'll go to Singapore.  They probably won't. But when it comes to Goldman, I, I think there's a very crucial point here.  Goldman's argument is going to be, ""We weren't smarter than everyone else in the room.  We didn't get it right in 2007.  We might have,"" which is what the committee's going to talk about, ""but in 2008 we didn't.  We lost billions of dollars, and we weren't smarter than everybody else,"" which is going to really impact their reputation as a firm.  They feel that it would have been better if they failed.  They're saying, ""We did risk management.  You wanted to go along the housing market.  We didn't want to take the risk, so we hedged it, and therefore our firm survived.  And now the country wants to punish us for doing what we were supposed to do."""
232,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we're going to take a quick break here, and we're going to go onto a different subject when we come back, which is have the government wars replaced the culture wars?  More with our roundtable right after this break."
233,(Announcements)
234,"MR. GREGORY:  We are back now with the roundtable.  And a big question that I've been thinking about this week, whether it's health care and its intervention into the economy, whether it's economic stimulus or whether it's financial regulation, it is about this debate between the role of government in society, in the economy, in our lives generally."
235,"David Brooks, you have been thinking about this a lot and you wrote this in your column on Friday:  ""In the first year of the Obama administration, the Democrats, either wittingly or unwittingly, decided to put the big government-versus-small government debate at the center of American life."" How's that playing out?"
236,"MR. BROOKS:  Not well, I don't think.  I don't think it's good for the country.  You know, we had a bitterly divisive culture war for a bunch of years, then we had a bitterly divisive debate about Iraq.  And I think a lot of people, including President Obama, were hoping we could get to other debates about opportunity, about productivity, about fiscal problems.  And that will--those would have been debates which would have structured some bipartisan cooperation.  But for whatever reason, we fall into a big government vs. small government debate.  And this is like a social script that puts all the Republicans on the anti-government mode, very polarized; strengthens the libertarian, more polarized part of that party; puts the Democrats on a more ""let's use government to do this and that"" mode.  And so you get this intense polarization which we've seen over the past year.  It also tends to help Republicans, by the way.  But
it's created, not only an end to the polarization, but it's magnified it, I think."
237,"MR. GREGORY:  And in fact, you saw this week, Evan Thomas, Pew Research Center comes out with a poll that says just 25 percent expressed a favorable opinion of Congress, virtually unchanged from March, prior to the passage of the healthcare reform bill.  And there was this from the Pew's analysis: ""Rather than an activist government to deal with the nation's top problems, the public now wants government reformed and growing numbers want its power curtailed.  With the exception of greater regulation of major financial institutions, there is less of an appetite for government solutions to the nation's problems--including more government control over the economy--than there was when Barack Obama first took office.  A lot of people think, ""Government can't get it done. They're broke and they can't do things well."""
238,"MR. THOMAS:  And Obama, you would think he'd get some points for first he passes health care, looks like he'll finance--pass financial reform.  But he doesn't.  He sort of floats around low in the polls.  People are really down on government.  It--I--to me, it's a deflection from the real issue, which is how we're going to pay for government.  That's the big thing looming out there.  That's what we ought to be talking about.  And, unfortunately, both sides have got to give on something because we're going to--you can't deal with it unless, one, you raise taxes, which people don't like; and, two, you cut benefits.  Both sides got to give. That's what Obama needs to be talking about because that is the real  challenge facing us."
239,"MR. GREGORY:  It's also, Michele, a challenge for Republicans as well. We've got an economy now where you have 53 percent of our economy is--our debt is 53 percent of our total economic output, and it's expected to go yet higher.  Kim Strassel, writing in her column in The Wall Street Journal, talked interestingly about the kind of opposition that Republicans are mounting and what the real Republican civil war is about. She writes, ""The Republican Party is split.  But the real divide is between reformers like [Florida Republican US Senate candidate Marco] Rubio and Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan, who are running on principles and tough issues, and a GOP old guard that still finds it politically expedient to duck or demagogue issues.  As Republicans look for a way out of the wilderness, this is the rift that matters."" Marco Rubio has talked about raising the retirement age for Social Security. Paul Ryan has talked about fundamentally restructuring Medicare in a way that's controversial and probably not politically popular.  But it goes to Evan's point, there's some reform-minded thinking out there.  Is that going to win out in terms of how Republicans oppose the administration?"
240,"MS. NORRIS:  Well, you know, you talk about this being a challenge for Republicans.  I mean, for--many people see this as--in an opposite way, they say this is actually an opportunity for Republicans.  Because, as David said, it pushes it--it actually, it motivates the people that are
on the far right. It's possible for them to do this.  But in order for them to talk about reform, as long as a Democrat is sitting in the White House, there has to be the kind of bipartisanship that we have not seen in the past 18 months and that we don't necessarily see on the horizon beyond the banking bill.  It, it is--there's opportunity for this, but unless there's a way that they can move forward and actually start working across the aisle, I think it's very hard to have any kind of meaningful reform that is pushed for and that is, is championed by Republicans."
241,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet, is the challenge for President Obama managing so much government expansion that he has to still be talking about a way--about, you know, the economy is improving, how they're creating jobs over the next two years, rather than looking backward and looking, you know, for the villains on Wall Street?"
242,"MS. BURNETT:  Right.  And, and look, part of it is our economy's growing, and it's growing at a very rapid rate right now.  Now, a lot of that is stimulus-fueled.  We don't know exactly how much of it's stimulus now and how much of it's real.  But we're just coming off an earnings
season where companies actually grew revenue for the first time since this crisis began. That may sound sort of, oh, Wall Street to people, but that's what America's about.  If you're selling more things and revenue is going up, people are buying more things.  So if the economy improves, a lot of this fiscal situation will improve.  Tax revenues will go up. Now, not in any way all of it."
243,MR. THOMAS:  But here's the thing...
244,MS. BURNETT:  But that will help him politically.
245,"MR. THOMAS:  Here's the thing.  This idea that we're going to grow our way out of it, which has been the great American way for a long time, you look at those long-term numbers, that's just not going to happen.  The gap between what--the revenues we have coming in and the expenditures we have going out in the next 10 years are not going to be bridged by growth.  We're going to have to do something about that situation.  It's the thing that just nobody wants to talk about, but there it is."
246,"MS. NORRIS:  And, yeah, two words:  baby boomers."
247,MR. BROOKS:  But...
248,"MS. NORRIS:  You know, as they start to..."
249,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
250,MS. NORRIS:  ...march into retirement and really put a drain on both Medicare and Social...
251,MR. GREGORY:  And entitlement issues.  Yeah.
252,"MR. BROOKS:  Can I just say something about the Republican mounting strategy, which is people like me would like there to be centrist, like Governor Crist, people like that.  But the center has so far proved unprincipled, and people like Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan have shown
they're principled.  And when you're disgusted by government, you congregate toward people like that.  And so the evidence shows overwhelmingly, so far, that the further right the party gets, as long as they're principled, the better they do.  Has any party had a worse year than the Democrats have had politically this year?  Democratic favorability rating has dropped 22 points in a year.  The Democrats a year ago had an 11 point party ID advantage over the Republicans.  All that's gone. So the Republicans are surging at the point they're moving to the right with people like Rubio.  And so that's where the data is. People like me would wish, you know, go for the middle.  But the data supports the idea that people like Rubio are driving the party to victory."
253,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, OK, but the, if your desire is for the center, where, to come back to your original point, is there a more centrist big government argument to make?  In other words, does President Obama have to win the argument that government is actually helpful?"
254,"MR. BROOKS:  Yeah.  Well, the, the, he won election because he won independents.  The tea party movement is like really big and sort of interesting, but the core movement in politics has been in the center. He's lost independents.  And so he has to go being sort of the way he was
on Wall Street this week, which is a pragmatic intelligent guy who talks about the things Evan talked about, that we need to have this, this--these things on both sides.  And if he can embody that, he'll, he personally will be able to recapture the suburban voter.  Whether the Democratic Party in the House can do it I'm really doubtful."
255,"MS. NORRIS:  If the party moves, if the Republican Party, though, moves further to the right, do they capture those voters that are in the middle?"
256,"MR. BROOKS:  Well, I, personally I'm dubious.  But I'd love to see some evidence to suggest that the Republicans I sort of like would do well.  I don't see any evidence of that.  I see the Rubios doing really well. "
257,MR. THOMAS:  But can the Rubio people ever get the 51 percent?
258,"MR. BROOKS:  Right.  I, I think the Republicans will do phenomenally well this year."
259,MR. THOMAS:  Mm-hmm.
260,"MR. BROOKS:  But it would be tough to see a Rubio-type candidate winning
in 2012."
261,MS. NORRIS:  Mm-hmm.
262,"MR. BROOKS:  But remember, the politic, the politics of the country are unprecedented, the disgust is amazing, and so I think we'd be hesitant to predict something like that."
263,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, and, Evan, how does Charlie Crist, Governor Crist down in Florida now thinking about becoming an independent to get out of this primary fight."
264,MR. THOMAS:  Yeah.
265,"MR. GREGORY:  You know, he embraced the stimulus with President Obama and has suffered politically.  As you, the question I asked Senator Dodd, how does President Obama play in an election year for Democrats?"
266,"MR. THOMAS:  Well, he's, he's--you know, he's appealing, he's reasonable, but nobody's listening.  I mean, it's like he's, he, I don't think he's really getting any, any real, real traction.  I think he's in a way too reasonable. In an era that we live in where everybody is kind of loud and dramatic, his very reasonableness means that he kind of floats along and doesn't have much impact one way or the other.  Now, maybe a few victories will help him, but I don't see that.  It's just like he's drifting.  I don't see the move to the center for him that would, that
would really help him.  I just--I don't think he's a force."

9,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
10,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
11,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  July is now the deadliest month for U.S. troops in the nearly nine-year war in Afghanistan.  With us, our lead newsmaker interview this morning, the president's principal military adviser, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen."
12,Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
13,"ADM. MULLEN:  Good morning, David."
14,"MR. GREGORY:  We just played for our viewers very strong comments by you this week about these leaks.  You indicated those who are responsible for making these secret documents public may already have blood on their hands, a strong statement.  What specifically do you mean?"
15,"ADM. MULLEN:  These--the, the, the scope and the volume of these leaks are unprecedented, and, and the specifics of them, and I've been through some of them, but we've still got a lot of work to do to, to really put the details together.  But I think the, the leaks themselves don't look clearly at the war that we're in.  There is an ability to put this kind of information together in the world that we're living in and the potential for costing us lives, I think, is significant.  I said, when it first occurred, I was appalled--I remain appalled--and that the potential
for the loss of lives of American soldiers or coalition soldiers or Afghan citizens is clearly there."
16,MR. GREGORY:  But how can that happen based on this?
17,"ADM. MULLEN:  Well, I would speak to--actually the Taliban spokesman has come out in the last day or so and said that they're looking at the names, and I think that's evidence of what that potential is.  So... "
18,MR. GREGORY:  These are Afghans that they're looking at?
19,"ADM. MULLEN:  These are--there are Afghan names that are, that are listed in the documents and specifically the Taliban spokesman said that they're going to look at that.  I think people that aren't..."
20,MR. GREGORY:  They could be killed is the point.
21,"ADM. MULLEN:  They--exactly.  And people that aren't in, in a fight like this, that don't do this for a living, don't understand what the potential is for something like this in terms of the kinds of information.  And a piece of information may seem very innocent in and of itself, and a lot of this is old information, but being able to net it together is--there's potential there that it could have a much bigger impact than just as is evident on the face of, of a piece of information."
22,MR. GREGORY:  What endangers you as troops?
23,"ADM. MULLEN:  The, the fact that they would look at what our tactics are, how we report, where we're fighting, who's involved, the, the kinds of things that we do.  And, and yet, there's--the volume is such that we really haven't put it all together to be able to say this is exactly what the potential is in terms of that."
24,"MR. GREGORY:  You are looking at a suspect, a private who you believe may be responsible for obtaining this information, ultimately leaking it. What should happen to those responsible?"
25,"ADM. MULLEN:  I think anybody in our--in the, in the national security apparatus has, has got to take full cognizance of their responsibility for the safeguarding of classified information.  I mean, I wouldn't go into the specific details of this investigation or of the case, the case
of this private..."
26,MR. GREGORY:  But is it treason?
27,"ADM. MULLEN:  Again, I'll let the investigation run its course, and we'll see where it goes, specifically.  But the concern, obviously, is for the leaking of classified information that is going to endanger people, operations and potentially, depending on how serious it is, outcomes."
28,"MR. GREGORY:  There, there are some who have argued that the fixation about the leak perhaps is a distraction from the larger point of these documents, and that is that it goes in an unvarnished way to the core question of whether the strategy is actually working.  The New York Times, as part of its reporting, made this piece of analysis--and I'll put it up on the screen--on Monday:  ""The documents--some 92,000 reports spanning parts of two administrations from January 2004 through December 2009--illustrate in mosaic detail why, after the United States has spent almost $300 billion on the war in Afghanistan, the Taliban are stronger than at any time since 2001."" Don't you think the public gets a look at these documents, and the bigger concern here is, not the leak, but the fact that this war may be a lost cause?"
29,"ADM. MULLEN:  I don't think that the Taliban being stronger than they've been since 2001 is, is news.  I mean, I've been concerned about the growing insurgency there for a number of years.  We really are at a time in Afghanistan, after the president's review, where we've got the right strategy, the right leadership, and the right resources.  And, and we really are in the second year of that aspect of Afghanistan.  I certainly understand it is the ninth year, it is a long time, the sacrifices have been significant, and yet, at the same time, I think the strategy'sright.  And the release of these documents, best that I can tell, have not affected the strategy.  Many of them were very, very old.  That said, it's still--I think we've got to work our way through exactly what the potential impact would be; and I think, from my perspective, we're headed in the right direction."
30,"MR. GREGORY:  But the reality is still the same, whether it's news or not, the disillusionment with the--among the American people about the fact that the Taliban is stronger and not weaker--go back a year ago, nearly, you were on this program, and I asked you about the mission, and here's a portion of what you said."
31,"(Videotape, August 23, 2009)"
32,MR. GREGORY:  We're rebuilding this nation?
33,"ADM. MULLEN:  To, to a certain degree, there is, there is some of that going on."
34,MR. GREGORY:  Is that what the American people signed up for?
35,"ADM. MULLEN:  No, I'm--right now, the American people signed up, I think, for support of getting at those who threaten us, and, and to the degree that, that the Afghan people's security and the ability to ensure that a safe haven doesn't recur in Afghanistan, there's focus on some degree of making sure security's OK, and making sure governance moves in the right
direction, and developing an economy which will underpin their future."
36,(End videotape)
37,"MR. GREGORY:  The problem with that a year on is that, again, the Taliban is stronger and there appears no evidence that they're willing to do the core thing, which is to turn their back on al-Qaeda.  Isn't that the case?"
38,"ADM. MULLEN:  Well, I think, again, that is the main mission is to make sure that, that Afghanistan can't become a safe haven again.  They are indeed stronger.  And yet the president approved additional forces, most of which are there, but there are still additional forces yet to come this year.  So we've said for many, many months this would be a very
difficult year; you pointed out the, the losses that have occurred in the month of July, the highest ever. We recognize that this is a tough fight, but we think we've got the resources right, the strategy right.  There's also a regional piece of this, a lot of effort gone on the Pakistan side, a significant effort on the part of Pakistani leadership, Pakistani mil to address that--military to address that as well.  But we're not there. We're at a point now where, over the course of the next 12 months, it really is going to, I think, tell the tale which, which way this is going to go."
39,"MR. GREGORY:  But another problem area, in terms of achieving the goal, is indeed Pakistan.  I've talked to people who say the strategy, in effect, boils down to this, with General Petraeus on the scene:  Bloody the nose of the Taliban to the point that they are willing to turn their
back on al-Qaeda, Pakistan can broker a deal where there is some power-sharing in the country where the, the Taliban have a seat at the table and control some part of that geography, and in return, al-Qaeda's out of the picture.  That's still a big ""if,"" and here's one of the reasons why:  Look at Pakistan's record; start with this Pew Research Center survey poll from this week:  ""How do Pakistanis view the U.S.?"" Nearly six in 10 see the United States as an enemy.  We know that the Taliban is operating from within Pakistan, from safe havens, and
escalating their attacks.  David Cameron, the conservative leader now of the U.K., prime minister said this, as reported by the Financial Times on Wednesday:  ""The U.K. prime minister used his first public appearance in Bangalore to warn Pakistan to stop `promoting terror' or face isolation in the international community."" And these, these documents demonstrate 
what a lot of people knew, which was the intelligence service for Pakistan was helping the Afghan Taliban.  Is Pakistan working against our interests there?"
40,"ADM. MULLEN:  I've said for a long time, clearly the--a, a critical key to success in the region is going to be Pakistan and our relationship with Pakistan, which was one that was broken in the late '80s and which we've worked hard to restore.  That there are elements of the Pakistani intelligence agency that are connected or have had relationships with
extremists is certainly known and that has to change.  I just came back from, I think, my 19th trip to Pakistan since I've been in this job, spending time, particularly with military leadership, General Kayani.  And he has, he has actually directed his military to take on the, the
insurgent threat in his own country. We--and he's made great strides.  We recognize that part of that is to focus on the Haqqani network and--as well as the other Afghan Taliban."
41,MR. GREGORY:  They operate in that tribal area?
42,"ADM. MULLEN:  They do.  And they, and they have a safe haven there, and that causes us great problems in Afghanistan as well.  That we are anxious to have that addressed is, is well known to him.  So this isn't going to turn overnight.  And you, you laid out one possible outcome.  I think it's a little early to say exactly what the outcome would look like
specifically.  Suffice it to say, I think we have to be in a stronger position in Afghanistan vis-a-vis the insurgency overall.  We have to continue to develop this relationship and evolve this relationship with Pakistan.  There's a regional approach here, and certainly India, which
is where Prime Mi nister Cameron spoke from, India is certainly more than just concerned with the overall outcome here."
43,"MR. GREGORY:  But true or untrue, the big fear is that Pakistan is working against us and not with us?"
44,"ADM. MULLEN:  In many ways Pakistan is working with us.  I mean, their, their military, their intelligence agency.  I mean, we've got a very strong relationship in the positive sense with, with their intelligence agency.  That doesn't mean there aren't some challenges with some aspects of it."
45,MR. GREGORY:  They are actively supporting elements killing U.S. soldiers.
46,"ADM. MULLEN:  But they have, they have shared intelligence with us, they've killed as many or more terrorists as anybody, they've captured them.  And certainly, the, the focus on changing the strategic shift, if you will, in that agency so that that doesn't happen at all, is a
priority for us."
47,MR. GREGORY:  Fair to say that among the outcomes you would look at would be a scenario where the Taliban would have some power in the country? 
48,"ADM. MULLEN:  I think in any of these kinds of insurgency over history, in the political solution, those who have been insurgents at some point in time have been in a position of political influence at some point down the road. But I think we're way too early to say how--what that looks like or when it might happen."
49,"MR. GREGORY:  It--it's--it seems to be an important point, if you look at the cover of Time magazine, which has a pretty striking photograph of a young woman whose nose was cut off by the Taliban, a--just one indication of how brutal and horrific these people are.  And, and they've done this when they were in power and, indeed, even when they've been out of power. The grim reality, if that's an argument for why the U.S. should not
leave, is that our central mission, the central mission of the United States is not to protect the women of Afghanistan.  Is that fair? "
50,"ADM. MULLEN:  I think the central mission in Afghanistan right now is to protect the people, certainly, and that would be inclusive of everybody, and that in a, in an insurgency and a counterinsurgency, that's really the center of gravity."
51,"MR. GREGORY:  But you said a year ago our central mission was to get at those who threaten us.  Our central mission is not to protect the women, who could still be brutalized if the Taliban comes into power in any fashion."
52,"ADM. MULLEN:  Well, the Taliban are incredibly unpopular with the Afghan people, even as we speak, and they have--as they have been for a long period of time.  The mission--the overall mission is to dismantle and defeat and disrupt al-Qaeda.  But we have to make sure there's not a safe haven that returns in Afghanistan.  Afghanistan has to be stable enough, has to have enough governance, have to--has to create enough jobs, have an economy that's good enough so that the Taliban cannot return to the brutality of the kind of regime that you just showed."
53,"MR. GREGORY:  However, the United States could still withdraw and, and do so having achieved the mission, and yet women like, like those on the cover of that magazine could still be in danger."
54,"ADM. MULLEN:  Certainly, the, the, the long-term goal is to make sure that the--with respect to the population in Afghanistan, that there's a governant--governance structure that treats its people well.  And I--but to say exactly how that's going to look and what specifics would be involved, I think it's just way too early."
55,"MR. GREGORY:  I just want to ask you a couple of questions about Iran, another threat that this administration is facing.  The consequences of Iran developing a nuclear weapon are vast, and something that the administration certainly wants to prevent.  This is what you said back in April of 2010, I'll put it up on the screen, at Columbia University:  ""I think Iran having a nuclear weapon would be incredibly destabilizing.  I think attacking them would also create the same kind of outcome."" Keen analysis, but my question is, which is worse?"
56,"ADM. MULLEN:  Actually, when I speak to that, I talk to unintended consequences of either outcome.  And it's those unintended consequences that are difficult to predict in what is a, an incredibly unstable part of the world that I worry about the most.  What I try to do when I talk
about that is, is identify the space between those two outcomes, which is pretty narrow, in which I think the diplomacy, the kind of sanctions, the kind of international pressure that, that is being applied, I am hopeful works.  I, I, I recognize that there isn't that much space there.  But, quite frankly, I am extremely concerned about both of those outcomes."
57,"MR. GREGORY:  But leaders have to make a decision.  You're a leader, the president's a leader.  Which is worse, Iran with a nuclear weapon or what could happen if the United States attacks?"
58,"ADM. MULLEN:  Well, certainly for our country, the president would be the one making those decisions, and I wouldn't be one that would, would pick one or the other along those lines.  I think they both have great downside, potentially."
59,"MR. GREGORY:  The president has said he is determined to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.  He doesn't just say it's unacceptable, he says he's determined to stop it.  Is force against Iran by the United States on the table in a way that it has not been even in our recent
history, past six months, a year?"
60,"ADM. MULLEN:  No, I, I think the military actions have been on the table and remain on the table, and certainly in that regard it's, it's one of the options that the president has.  Again, I hope we don't get to that. But it's an important option, and it's one that's well understood."
61,"MR. GREGORY:  There was a concern among Israelis, among Americans, that there weren't very many good options when it came to attacking Iran, should it come to that.  Is that still the case?"
62,ADM. MULLEN:  I think that's the case.
63,MR. GREGORY:  There aren't very many good options.
64,"ADM. MULLEN:  No, no.  I mean, there aren't--it depends on what you mean by that.  None of them are good in a sense that it's certainly an outcome that I don't seek, or that, that we wouldn't seek.  At the same time, and for what I talked about before, is, is not just the consequences of the action itself, but the things that could result after the fact."
65,"MR. GREGORY:  But the military has a plan, should it come to that?"
66,ADM. MULLEN:  We do.
67,"MR. GREGORY:  Admiral Mullen, one final question of something I'm sure deeply troubles you, and that is the rate of suicides in the military. And the concern is not just that they have been increasing, but that commanders in the field have not been attentive enough to the, the
problems that are leading to the suicides.  What should be done about that?"
68,"ADM. MULLEN:  Well, I, I think it was addressed this week very well by General Chiarelli, specifically.  I mean, the purpose of the review, which was widely reported on, was to understand as much as we could about what the problem was.  It is not a problem that exists just in the Army, because the suicide rate is up in all our services.  And we don't have the answers.  I'm one who believes that the pressure of these wars and the repeated deployments is a significant factor, but there's a significant population that have committed suicide that have not deployed.  So it's a, it's an incredibly complex, vexing problem.  I think what General Chiarelli did was, was correctly focus on leaders to be all-attentive to this in every single way and know that we certainly, we're not even close to solving it.  It's an enormously complex problem nationally for us, and certainly we are a microcosm of that.  But our rates now exceed the norm in the country, and it's something we absolutely have to continue to focus on."
69,"MR. GREGORY:  Admiral Mullen, thank you very much."
70,"ADM. MULLEN:  Thank you, David."
71,"MR. GREGORY:  And we will continue our discussion with Admiral Mullen in our MEET THE PRESS Take Two Web extra, up online this afternoon.  Plus, look for updates from me throughout the week.  It's all on our Web site, mtp.msnbc.com."
72,"Up next, the economic outlook.  If this is really recovery, why does it still feel like a recession?  Three key voices weigh in:  New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan, and Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell.  Then, assessing the Obama presidency in this highly-charged midterm election year, analysis from Doris Kearns Goodwin and Mark Halperin.  Only here on MEET THE PRESS. "
73,(Announcements)
74,"MR. GREGORY:  Slow growth and high unemployment, why does Recovery Summer still feel like a recession?  New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, former Fed chair Alan Greenspan, and Governor Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania weigh in right after this brief commercial break."
75,(Announcements)
76,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We are back.  The biggest challenge facing this administration by far is the deep economic hole this country is still in. This week, the government adjusted its economic growth numbers, illustrating that the economic recovery is slower and more fragile than previously thought. Here to shed some light on what the administration calls Recovery Summer, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee and governor of Pennsylvania, of course, Ed Rendell; New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg; and former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan."
77,"Welcome to all of you.  There is so much to discuss, and we'll get to as much as we possibly can."
78,"Mayor Bloomberg, Recovery Summer is how the White House is describing this, and yet, we know that the recovery in the second quarter is slower, we know that unemployment is stubbornly high, that companies have a lot of cash but they're not hiring.  So my question is, why is it that recovery feels so much like recession?"
79,"MAYOR MIKE BLOOMBERG:  Well, you have the public not wanting any new spending, you have the Republicans not wanting any new taxes, you have the Democrats not wanting any new spending cuts, you have the markets not wanting any new borrowing, and you have the economists wanting all of the above.  And that leads to paralysis.  And paralysis, it leads to uncertainty, and uncertainty is not good.  You don't make spending decisions, investment decisions, hiring decisions, or whether-you're-going-to-look-for-a-job decisions when you don't know what's going to happen.  You pass 2,000-page bills, but the regulations are where all the details are.  Everybody's got to lobby up with lobbyists and, and lawyers, and nobody knows what the future is.  That's not good.  We have to end the uncertainty, and until you do that, I don't think you come out of this recession."
80,"MR. GREGORY:  Dr. Greenspan, the Associated Press reported on a survey this week of economists, and we'll put a portion of it up on the screen. ""A bleaker outlook for the economy into 2011.  The U.S. economic recovery will remain slow deep into next year, held back by shoppers reluctant to spend, employers hesitant to hire."" That's according to an AP survey of
leading economists. "
81,"""The latest quarterly AP Economy Survey shows economists have turned gloomier in the past three months.  They foresee weaker growth and higher unemployment than they did before."" The current Fed chairman, Bernanke, said the outlook is ""unusually uncertain."" A little bit of newer generation Fed speak there.  Does that mean--do you think that means the
economy gets worse before it gets better?"
82,"MR. ALAN GREENSPAN:  Maybe, but not necessarily.  I think we're in a pause in a recovery, a modest recovery.  But a pause in the modest recovery feels like quasi recession.  Our problem, basically, is that we have a very distorted economy in the sense that there has been a
significant recovery in a limited area of the economy amongst high-income individuals who have just had $800 billion added to their 401(k)s and are spending it and are carrying what consumption there is.  Large banks, who are doing much better, and large corporations, whom you point out and the--and everyone's pointing out, are in excellent shape.  The rest of
the economy, small business, small banks, and a very significant amount of the labor force, which is in tragic unemployment, long-term unemployment, that is pulling the economy apart.  The average of those two is what we are looking at, but they are fundamentally two separate
types of economy. "
83,"MR. GREGORY:  If you add in the housing crisis, which remains a crisis, do you think it's possible that we get this double-dip recession that a lot of people fear?"
84,"MR. GREENSPAN:  It is possibly if home prices go down.  Home prices, as best we can judge, have really flattened out in the last year.  And while it is true that most economists expect a small dip from here, largely as a consequence of the ending of the tax credit, the data don't show that at this particular stage.  If home prices stay stable, then I think we
will skirt the worst of the housing problem.  But right under this current price level, maybe 5, 7 or 8 percent below is a very large block of mortgages which are underwater, so to speak, or could be underwater, and that would induce a major increase in foreclosures.  Foreclosures
would feed on the weakness in prices, and it would create a problem.  So that--it's touch and go."
85,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor Rendell, one of the things that Secretary Geithner said on this program last week is that we've reached a point, as he said, where we need to make a transition to a recovery led by private investment, led by the private sector.  So, you know, government has to take its foot off the accelerator when it comes to stimulus.  But here's
a reality that we're talking about at so many states where, on the local level, on the state level, huge, huge cutbacks creating more unemployment in states.  Governor Paterson telling The Washington Post earlier this month, we'll put it up on the screen, ""We may be looking at a culture and lifestyle around this country that will start to remind people of the Depression, not a recession, if we cut through these budgets much more."" That's the tension.  Governor of New York, of course, saying, you know, government can't pull back when you have so many people still in need."
86,"GOV. ED RENDELL (D-PA):  Well, first of all, I, I want to piggyback on what the mayor said.  I think the mayor's absolutely right about the paralysis. But I think the paralysis is driven mostly by partisanship and by the fall election.  David Walker of the Peterson Foundation said it
best.  We should still be investing in things that stimulate the economy, and we can do that at the same time that we put together a long-term plan for deficit reduction.  We can do both, and we have to do both.  For example, and you've heard the mayor and I talk about infrastructure, well, the infrastructure part of the stimulus has worked.  There's
absolutely no question about it.  We can demonstrate in Pennsylvania and other states around the union how it's produced good-paying jobs, both on the construction sites and back in American factories.  It has worked. We should be investing more money in our infrastructure right now. We need it, number one, and number two, it's the best job creator."
87,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  You know, if you look back in the 1930s, the money went to infrastructure.  The bridges, the municipal buildings, the roads, those were all built with stimulus money spent on infrastructure.  This stimulus bill has fundamentally gone, started out with a $500 rebate check, remember.  That went to buy flat-screen TVs made in China.  That
didn't exactly help our economy. Then all of this other stimulus money that's been given out to governments, they're using it for operating rather than investment.  And the monies that are going to, to the private sector, they're doing the pet projects for companies that happen to have some influence throughout this country.  And the argument is, ""Well, these people would get laid off if we didn't do that,"" but nobody's directing this money at the people who've already been laid off."
88,MR. GREGORY:  Where do you see unemployment as we move through the rest of this year and beyond? 
89,"MR. GREENSPAN:  I see we just stay where we are.  The--there is a gradual increase in employment, but not enough to reduce the level of unemployment."
90,MR. GREGORY:  We're at or about 10 percent.
91,"MR. GREENSPAN:  Well, we're 9.5, and..."
92,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But I'm saying, is that where we remain, do you think?"
93,"MR. GREENSPAN:  Yeah, yeah.  I, I would say that there's nothing out there that I can see which will alter the, the, the trend or the level of unemployment in this context."
94,"MR. GREGORY:  Interest rates, how long before they start coming up?  Do they need to stay low?"
95,"MR. GREENSPAN:  Well, the problem there implies that the government has control over those rates, meaning the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, in a sense.  There is no doubt that the federal funds rate, that is the rate produced by the Federal Reserve, can be fixed at whatever the Fed wants it to be, but which the government has no control
over is long-term interest rates, and long-term interest rates are what make the economy move. And if this budget problem eventually merges to the point where it begins to become very toxic, it will be reflected in rising long-term interest rates, rising mortgage rates, lower housing. At the moment, there is no sign of that, basically because the financial system is broke and you cannot have inflation if financial system is not working."
96,"MR. GREGORY:  Mayor Bloomberg, let me talk about the tax cut debate which is gripping Washington right now and will for some time.  E.J. Dionne writes this in his column this week in The Washington Post.  ""Political stupidity, U.S. style"" is the headline.  ""Can a nation remain a
superpower if its internal politics are incorrigibly stupid?"
97,"""Start with taxes,"" he writes.  ""In every other serious democracy, conservative political parties feel at least some obligation to match their tax policies with their spending plans.  David Cameron, the new conservative prime minister in Britain, is a leading example."
98,"""He recently offered a rather brutal budget that includes severe cutbacks.  I have doubts about some of them, but at least Cameron cared enough about reducing his country's deficit that alongside the cuts he also proposed an increase in the value-added tax, from 17.5 percent to 20 percent.  Imagine:  a fiscal conservative"" who could--""who really is a
fiscal conservative."
99,"""That could never happen here because the fairy tale of supply-side economics insists that taxes are always too high, especially on the rich."" And yet the administration says economic growth won't be affected if you let the tax cuts expire for the wealthiest Americans."
100,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  I don't think you want to run the risk that they are wrong. I would say let's go on with the tax cuts for another couple of years, but you couple it with long-term solutions.  And you have to look at what's politically possible."
101,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor Rendell, that is not the position of the administration or Democrats, who want to make this a, a big midterm election issue."
102,"GOV. RENDELL:  And, and interestingly, I certainly agree with what the mayor said.  It--what we've got to do is, I think Simpson-Bowles is very important. I think both parties have to get together..."
103,MR. GREGORY:  That's the debt commission's suggestions on how to cut spending.
104,"GOV. RENDELL:  The debt commission.  Both parties have to get together and say, ""We're going to do this together, we're going to make the changes. They're not going to be popular, but they're necessary."" But you have to have increased taxes along with those reductions.  And this fairy tale that increased taxes on the rich is going to hurt the economy, well,
we don't have to look any further than 1993.  What Bill Clinton did, without one Republican vote, was essentially the same thing.  He raised taxes on the top 2 percent in, in America.  That was combined with budget cuts that the president and the Republican Congress did together, and it produced 23.5 million new jobs in the seven years that followed."
105,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  OK, but keep in mind you had that virtuous cycle going. We did not have a war, and a lot of things went perfectly."
106,"GOV. RENDELL:  There's no question.  But there's also no question that that's irrefutable.  If it was going to hurt small business, you would have seen not anywhere close to 23.5 million jobs created."
107,MR. GREGORY:  Well...
108,"GOV. RENDELL:  What I think we ought to do, sit down after the election, because it's our only chance to do this, everyone takes responsibility for cutting the entitlement programs which, as the mayor said, are absolutely necessary.  We maybe phase in the elimination of the tax, tax
cut for the rich over two or three years.  I'd accept that.  But taxes, as you said and Prime Minister Cameron did, you have to do both.  You have to cut spending, and we ought to be doing that, you have to continue the short-term stimulus, as David Walker said, and you've got to raise some revenue."
109,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Well, Dr. Greenspan, it's not often that you hear Democrats and liberals quoting you.  But, in this case they did when it come to--came to tax cuts because of an interview you gave recently with Judy Woodruff on Bloomberg television.  Here was the
question:  ""Tax cuts [that] are due to expire at the end of this year. Should they be extended?  What should Congress do?"" You said, ""I should say they should follow the law and then let them lapse."" Question:  ""So to those interests who say but wait a minute, if you let these taxes go my taxes go up, it's going to depress growth?"" You said, ""Yes, it
probably will, but I think we have no choice in doing that, because we have to recognize there are no solutions which are optimum.  These are choices between bad and worse."" You're saying let them all go, let them all lapse?"
110,"MR. GREENSPAN:  Look, I'm very much in favor of tax cuts, but not with borrowed money.  And the problem that we've gotten into in recent years is spending programs with borrowed money, tax cuts with borrowed money, and at the end of the day, that proves disastrous.  And my view is I don't think we can play subtle policy here on it."
111,MR. GREGORY:  You don't agree with Republican leaders who say tax cuts pay for themselves?
112,MR. GREENSPAN:  They do not.
113,"MR. GREGORY:  Couple of other topics I want to get to.  Financial reform is a big one.  A couple weeks from now a big sequel's coming out to movie theaters, and a lot of people like to watch the movies, and this is greed.  This is the sequel to ""Wall Street."" And here was a clip from that original film, ""Wall Street."" Let's show it."
114,(videotape) 
115,"Mr. MICHAEL DOUGLAS (as Gordon Gekko in ""Wall Street""):  Greed, for lack of a better word, is good.  Greed is right.  Greed works.  Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit."
116,(end videotape)
117,"MR. GREGORY:  Today is Wall Street different, and will financial reform make Wall Street different?"
118,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  The devil's in the details.  A 2,000-page bill that very few people have ever read, but it basically turns over to the SEC and the Fed and other agencies the responsibility to write regulations. This is a dream piece of legislation for lobbyists and for lawyers.  And nobody knows the answer to your question."
119,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me show something, Dr. Greenspan.  David Brooks in his column writes about this bad blood between the Obama administration and the, the business community, which has only gotten worse because of financial reform.  And I'll put it up on the screen, what Brooks writes in his column. ""The psychological war between business and the Obama
administration also is taking a toll.  Business types think the administration is stuffed with clueless professors.  Some administration officials think corporate honchos are free-market hypocrites prowling for corporate welfare."" How did things get so bad?  Because a lot of people
in the business community say a big part of the problem is there's nobody who works in the administration that's actually run anything, that's actually run a business, and that's contributing to their attitude and their policies."
120,"MR. GREENSPAN:  I can't answer that question, and the reason I can't is I've never seen anything like this.  I've been in and out of Wall Street since 1949, and I've never seen the type of animosity between government and Wall Street.  And I'm not sure where it comes from, but I suspect it's got to do with a general schism in this society which is really becoming ever more destructive.  We've got to change it. "
121,"MR. GREGORY:  You see it firsthand, you see that animosity.  Why?"
122,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  The public is upset.  If they haven't lost their job, they know somebody that has.  If they haven't lost their house, they know somebody that has.  What do you do?  When something's wrong, it's government's job to fix it, it must be government that's responsible for causing it.  Government wants to stay in office, they look for somebody else to blame.  And it's much too simplistic to say the banks did everything wrong.  We all wanted to expand the economy, we all wanted to expand home ownership.  We all wanted Wall Street to create the money so we could have all these mortgages.  And then invariably that leads to
excess, and then invariably that leads to a correction, more violent with time.  And then we have to look for villains. And we've got to stop all this.  One of government's jobs is to promote the economy and to promote American commerce and finance and the arts around the world.  And this constant tearing each other apart--we can sit down and we can say, ""What did we do wrong?"" and ""How are we going to fix it?"" But always pointing fingers and finding fault with everybody, we need to find solutions. "
123,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Governor, you--when you are a president at a time of such high unemployment and, and recession, to have such a poor relationship with the business community is a very difficult thing, particularly when you have the Treasury secretary saying, ""Look, it's got--recovery can only be led by the private sector."""
124,"GOV. RENDELL:  Right.  And it's got to be repaired, there's no question about it.  But I, I think it goes to a fundamental question:  Is regulation, per se, bad?  Is better regulation bad?  I think better regulation is good for the business community, and I think that's something we should get together on."
125,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to go around the horn on, on some final thoughts on, on key issues, and I'll start with you, Mayor.  On immigration, what is the impact of what we've seen, the judge's ruling this week, the protests that continue on something that you feel strongly about, which is a more comprehensive solution?"
126,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Well, it, it--there will be a lot of litigation, I think there's no question about that.  And whatever Arizona is allowed to do and does do is not going to have a great impact on the rest of this country.  This is a national problem.  We have to get control of our
borders.  You can only do that if you make companies obey the law and not hire undocumented or illegals.  They can only do that is--if they have a Social Security card that has biometrics so they know whether the person is legal or not.  We have to do something about the 12 million
undocumented here.  Yes, they broke the law, but we can't deport them. Let's get over this pointing fingers and do something about that, whether it--they have to pay a fine, learn to speak English, the history, you can do that.  And then you have to give visas for the skills we need.  Canada sets aside 36 percent of their visas for people with skills they think their country needs.  We set aside 6 percent.  We educate the doctors and then don't give them a green card."
127,"MR. GREGORY:  I'm, I'm almost out of time, so I just want to--Governor, I want to go to you on this point about high unemployment.  When you were here some months ago you said, for the Democrats to keep control, if there's unemployment that's double digits, very hard to do.  Do Democrats hold the House?"
128,"GOV. RENDELL:  I think we hold the House.  We lose significant seats, but we hold.  And I think we hold the Senate only because the Republicans have made a slew of mistakes, PR mistakes like opposing unemployment compensation extension, like going after the president for the BP deal. There weren't 5 percent of Americans who didn't think that was a good
deal."
129,"MR. GREGORY:  Dr. Greenspan, the Dow, an important barometer, as you've said before on this program, because there's real money there, there's real wealth. Are we out of the woods in the sense that Dow 10,000-plus you think is here to stay?"
130,"MR. GREENSPAN:  I wish I could answer that one.  It's a critical issue because, as you point out and as I've always believed, we underestimate the impact of stock prices on economic activity.  Asset prices are having a profoundly important effect.  What created the extent of the contraction globally was the loss of $37 trillion in market value.  It collapsed the value of collateral in the system and it disabled finance. We've come all the way back--maybe a little more than halfway, and it's had a very positive effect. I don't know where the stock market is going, but I will say this, that if it continues higher, this will do more to stimulate the economy than anything we've been talking about today or anything anybody else was talking about. "
131,"MR. GREGORY:  Final political point, Mayor Bloomberg.  Congressman Rangel, do you think he should stay in his job or should he step aside? "
132,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Well, it's very sad.  It's not good for New York.  He was one of our representatives and was going to be a powerful one who could really deliver for New York.  I'll let Congress worry about whether he did the things that he is alleged to have done.  But the whole thing is, I think, symptomatic of we don't have the kind of disclosure, Congress doesn't have the kind of self-policing and openness and visibility that this country deserves."
133,"MR. GREGORY:  2012 is still something that people speculate about, Mayor Bloomberg, and you said something interesting..."
134,MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  We are not going to get the Olympics for 2012.
135,"MR. GREGORY:  The Wall Street Journal reported this, thinking about your future, ""[Bloomberg] suggested the main reason he's not seeking the White House"" in 2012 ""is because he can't get elected.  His only supporters, he joked [in a speech up at Dartmouth]"" in New Hampshire, ""are Diana Taylor, his longtime companion, and his 101-year-old mother, Charlotte."" God bless her."
136,"""`Every one of my positions cuts out half the country,' Mr. Bloomberg explained.  `I'm pro-choice.  I'm pro-gay rights.  I'm pro-immigration. I'm against guns.  I believe in Darwin.'"" Even with so, so many independents in vogue these days, you will rule out a run again?"
137,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  I will rule out a run.  I've got the best job that I could possibly have.  I've got 1,251 days more to do it.  I'm looking forward to every single one of them.  And I will call my mother to check on her political leanings."
138,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Thank you all very much.
139,"And up next, leadership tests for President Obama, ethics charges against Congressman Charlie Rangel, and all the attention over Chelsea Clinton's big wedding last night.  Presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and Time magazine's Mark Halperin are next after this brief station break."
140,(Announcements)
141,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  And we are back.  Joining me now, Time magazine editor-at-large and MSNBC's senior political analyst, Mark Halperin, as well as presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. "
142,"Welcome, both of you.  We'll get to the, to the big story today, a lot of people paying attention to the Chelsea Clinton wedding.  We'll have some of the pictures and talk a little about that in just a moment.  But I want to talk about such difficult subjects, Doris, and the question of how the president is performing under the weight of a war in Afghanistan
that is not going well, that has such significant challenges and that the public appears to be losing support for, and the economy.  Alan Greenspan just saying tragic unemployment is the real challenge here.  These are huge weights on the president."
143,"MS. DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:  And the most important thing for a president, both in the midst of a war and a troubled economy, is to use that bully pulpit. You know, Teddy Roosevelt said it's the unparalleled platform to get your agenda across, and somehow the ""Great Communicator"" has to figure out the right way for him to do that.  When he went to the auto 
companies, it really worked because he showed energy and feistiness and showed that there was success.  You know, the incredible thing is, in 1934 FDR was in a similar condition with the economy.  People were saying it hadn't recovered, that the economy was still stubbornly high
unemployment, just like you said, it was 20 percent; yet, he persuaded the people that he was moving forward, he showed them where the successes were, and he gave them confidence in the future.  He won the midterm elections in 1934."
144,"On Afghanistan, we don't have a sense of any kind of progress over there, which is a real problem.  Again, going back to my buddy FDR, the reason he invaded North Africa in, in 1942 was he had to show progress. Eisenhower didn't want him to do it, Marshall didn't want him to do it, but he said the--and Marshall finally later said, ""I didn't understand in a democracy the people have to be entertained."" Where's the progress that we're going to see in Afghanistan?  You have to keep public support both on the economy and the war or these things will really become troubling."
145,"MR. GREGORY:  And I want to come back to the war in just a moment.  But, Mark Halperin, on the point about the economy, and specifically the auto bailouts, because the White House really made a point of saying, ""Look, there is some success here.  We bailed them out, it was unpopular, and look, they have come back.  We saved jobs.  If we had walked away, it
would have been so much worse."" I was reading Ezra Klein's blog on washingtonpost.com this morning, he made the point that the White House doesn't lack for accomplishments, it lacks for popular accomplishments. The president was out in Michigan on Friday and tried to turn that
around.  I want to show a portion of what he said."
146,"(Videotape, Friday)"
147,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  So the bottom line is this:  We've got a long way to go, but we're beginning to see some of these tough decisions pay off.  We are moving forward.  I want you to remember, though, if some folks had their way, none of this would have been happening.  Just want to point that out.  Right? I mean, this, this, this, this plant, this plant and
your jobs might not exist.  There were leaders of the just-say-no crowd in Washington, they were saying, ""Oh, standing by the auto industry will guarantee failure."" One of them called it the worst investment you could possibly make."
148,(End videotape)
149,"MR. GREGORY:  Mark, what strikes me is that the president is still trying to win the argument on some of these big issues."
150,"MR. MARK HALPERIN:  That--there's a two-part argument.  You saw part of it there.  Look, it's very hard to say--have your message be, ""I'm not as bad as George Bush."" That's not a rousing, optimistic message, particularly when, like George Bush, you're a president with a bad
economy, an unpopular war, and a division in Washington.  That message, to keep reminding people that he's made some tough decisions and he thinks they're going to pay off, is part of it.  Part of it, though, he did at the auto companies last week, he's going back to do another auto event this week, is to say to the American people, ""You've succeeded.
The American people have worked hard through adversity. We're not out of it yet, but we've had success."" He needs right track.  He needs the country thinking things can be better.  He needs some good news. And he's not the best messenger usually about other things than himself.  He's good at talking about what I have done.  That's what got him elected.  He
now is switching, and I think it's smart, to saying, ""Here's what the country can do.  It may not be morning in America, but things can be better because of the hard work of the American people."" That's a, I think, a more effective message."
151,"MR. GREGORY:  And we know that, that some of the reporting this morning indicating the president's going to try to frame this message more from afar, it is striking, Doris, that you think back to the election of 2008, he was going into red states and blue states alike, and he was so popular in these districts.  Now you've got these close districts for Democrats,
and they may not want him there because he's more of a negative.  And then you add to that the situation with Charlie Rangel, the New York congressman who's now facing an ethics trial, charges against him.  The president was asked about, about Congressman Rangel, and he, he--to say the support was tepid was an understatement.  This is what he said to CBS."
152,"(Videotape, Friday) "
153,"PRES. OBAMA:  I think Charlie Rangel served a very long time and served his constituents very well.  But these allegations are very troubling. And, you know, he's somebody who's at the end of his career, 80 years old.  I'm sure that what he wants is to be able to end his career with
dignity, and my hope is that happens."
154,(End videotape)
155,"MR. GREGORY:  The last thing that Democrats need.  They didn't get a lot of support there, Congressman Rangel didn't, from the president. "
156,"MS. GOODWIN:  There's something about this chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee.  When you think of Charlie Rangel, you think of Wilbur Mills and the ""Argentine Firecracker,"" you think of Dan Rostenkowski. They were all there.  And then Rostenkowski's seat is eventually taken by Blago."
157,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
158,"MS. GOODWIN:  So anyway, I think that what needs to be done for the president, even if people say they don't want him in their district, he needs to go into those districts and show those jobs that have been lost. You know, he said on ""The View"" a very good thing.  Maybe people say it doesn't matter if jobs are lost unless it's your job that's lost."
159,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
160,"MS. GOODWIN:  Why not have the police guys out there, the firefighters, the teachers, visually show the success.  He's got to prove that the stimulus worked where it did work.  He's got to prove that the bank bailout is being repaid by interest.  He's got to prove the positives of health care, and he's got to go into the districts, show the energy he did in the auto thing.  He was great there.  He should just do that again and again."
161,"MR. GREGORY:  Back to Rangel, though, Mark.  Can he survive this?"
162,"MR. HALPERIN:  Well, the president was giving him a little shove, it seemed pretty clear.  Both congressional Democrats and people in the White House are hoping that Rangel thinks this through and realizes that this is not a good way to end his career.  I don't think the White
House--this is not the worst thing for the Democrats, the midterms, because they have bigger problems on the economy.  But it does remind people about Washington not working.  And I think there's no doubt there's a racial component to this, as well, that's not good for the
Democratic Party and for the president."
163,"MR. GREGORY:  Finally here, it was back in 1992 we were introduced to the  Clinton family with this image on the cover or People magazine at the governor's mansion in Arkansas in the backyard, the young family. Fast-forward now, young Chelsea Clinton is a married lady.  Looks like a beautiful ceremony with the former president walking her down the aisle.
Doris, as we look at these pictures, what strikes you about the, the, the interest in Chelsea's wedding? "
164,"MS. GOODWIN:  Well, I think we've lived with this family in a very intimate way, given all the troubles and the successes that they've had. And in a certain sense, it shows how far we've come as a country.  When Maria Monroe got married, 34 words in a Washington newspaper, compared to this incredible excitement.  Whatever Democrats and Republicans may say about the Clintons, the legacy in this kid--well-balanced, smart, and, and seemingly in terrific shape--is a great legacy to have. "
165,"MR. GREGORY:  And, and just a few seconds left, it's interesting, it really was about them.  It wasn't about the Clintons and all of their friends and a big, a big to do."
166,"MR. HALPERIN:  Yeah.  First politician I ever covered was Bill Clinton, and I thought, you know, this guys seems pretty interesting.  The country is more fascinated with the Clintons, and the press is more fascinated with the Clintons, than anybody.  And I'm glad that Chelsea got through her wedding with a fair amount of privacy and decorum because it could have been an even bigger circus than it was."
167,"MR. GREGORY:  Absolutely.  All right, both of you, thank you very much."
168,We'll be right back.
169,(Announcements)
170,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  That is all for today.  We'll be back next week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, the hole has finally been plugged in the gulf, but is it really mission accomplished?  How much oil was spilled? Is the environmental crisis over?  How will BP be held accountable? Plus, where do we go from here on energy policy and oil drilling?  I'll ask the president's top environmental and energy adviser, Carol Browner.

5,"Finally, our political roundtable weighs in on the long, hot political summer for the president--ethics scandals, jobs, gay marriage, the war in Afghanistan, and the choice in November."
6,(Videotape)

9,"MR. GREGORY:  With us, former congressman from Tennessee and the author of the new book ""More Davids than Goliaths,"" Democrat Harold Ford; congressman from Indiana and the chairman from the House Republican Conference, Mike Pence; Vanity Fair's national editor Todd Purdum; and NBC's Andrea Mitchell."
10,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
11,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
12,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  It has been 111 days since the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico.  The leak has been plugged, but there are many questions that remain.  Here with us now, live this morning in an exclusive interview, the president's top
environmental and energy adviser, Carol Browner."
13,"Ms. Browner, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS."
14,MS. CAROL BROWNER:  Thank you.
15,"MR. GREGORY:  The split-screen, the before and after, is striking, and we'll put it up on the screen now.  When the oil was gushing, this is what it looked like on the left, and now it has been plugged, on the right.  The headline in The Times-Picayune down in New Orleans really
begs the question, ""End in Sight as Cement Pumped into [the] Rogue Well."" Is the crisis over?"
16,"MS. BROWNER:  Well, I think the first phase is over in that the well is not leaking, it has not leaked since July 15th.  Obviously the relief well still has to be finished.  That's probably another 10 to 14 days away.  But then we have to stay focused on making sure the beaches are clean, the environmental damage is restored, and cleaned up.  And, that BP is held accountable.  So we see this as a phase, but not the end by any means."
17,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let's go through some of those, then, in turn because they are all important.  The question of how much oil is left is one that you have been asked.  You were on the ""Today"" program on Wednesday, and this is what you said.  Because there's skepticism about some of it."
18,"(Videotape, Wednesday)"
19,"MS. BROWNER:  I think it's also important to note that our scientists have done an initial assessment and more than three-quarters of the oil is gone, the vast majority of the oil is gone."

21,"MR. GREGORY:  Three-quarters of the oil is gone.  Again, there are some who are casting doubt about that, the claim that you have made.  Let's look at--the National Incident Command has put together a graphic of where the oil is--and if you put it on the screen--residual, 26;
evaporated or dissolved, 25 percent; 24 percent using dispersant.  So it's dispersed, and that becomes important--burned, skimmed, direct recovery.  So you have roughly 50 percent there that is still residual or has maybe broken apart."
22,"This is how The Washington Post reported on it on Thursday under the headline, ""Scientists Question the Report of Shrinking Spill."" "
23,"""Some outside researchers said that, given the uncertainty about what's happening in the gulf, the administration's assertion that 74 percent of the oil had been accounted for seemed too optimistic.  They saw it another way: About half of the oil is probably gone for certain:
skimmed, burned, siphoned or evaporated.  They said the other half, including the 24 percent that's been `dispersed' but is underwater, is the real total of what's missing.  Despite the largest oil-spill response in history, these 2.5 million barrels of oil will be cleaned up by the
Gulf of Mexico, if at all.  The situation is `being portrayed as ""the oil is out of the environment; it's gone,""' said Michael Blum, professor at Tulane University in New Orleans.  But, he said, all that's certain is that `the form of the oil has shifted.  Dispersed oil is still oil. It's
just in a different form.'"""
24,"So how much is still there and how damaging is it, potentially?"
25,"MS. BROWNER:  Well, I think it's important to understand that this was the largest response to an environmental disaster.  We had over 6,000 vessels, more than 40,000 people, and the goal was to keep the oil off the beaches and out of the marshes and the estuaries.  Now, some of it
did get on the beaches, some of it got into the estuaries.  That has to be cleaned up.  Some of it may continue to come on shore, the residual. It'll come on in tar balls and tar mats, and that can be cleaned up.  But I think, you know, there was the skimming, there was the burning, there was the containing, it was very successful.  Some of it is continuing to
break down naturally in the environment--we're talking about molecules the size of a piece of hair--and we're going to continue to monitor that. The EPA has been monitoring, NOAA is monitoring, the Food and Drug Administration is looking at the fish; and, right now, nobody's seeing anything of concern.  And I think the good news--and I was just down in the gulf.  I was in Florida on Thursday and Friday.  The good news is we're not seeing huge amounts of oil on our beaches and in our marshes. "
26,"MR. GREGORY:  But you acknowledge that 50 percent of that oil could still be in the gulf in some form.  We're far from being out of the woods of this.  I mean, you talk about on the order of maybe, what, 100 million gallons?  This is many orders of magnitude larger than the Exxon Valdez spill in terms of the sheer amount of oil that's still in there, correct?"
27,"MS. BROWNER:  Well, the--this is 18 times bigger than the Exxon Valdez, when you look at the total amount that spilled.  But, again, it's been captured, it's been contained, it's been burned.  I mean, this was a massive response. I mean, if you look at what was accomplished in terms
of the beaches..."
28,"MR. GREGORY:  But the question, Ms. Browner, is, what the impact is of the remaining oil.  If--you're saying, ""Look, most of it's gone, essentially. Don't worry about it."" The scientists are saying, ""We, we don't know if we can not worry about it just yet."""
29,"MS. BROWNER:  No one's saying don't worry.  What we're saying is, right now, the tests show nothing of concern.  We're going to continue to test. We're not going away.  We're going to continue to work with the Gulf Coast communities to make sure their economic losses are honored, to get the fisheries reopened when appropriate.  Later today, the president's
birthday party, he's going to be serving his guests seafood from the Gulf of Mexico. You know, we want to make sure that these communities are restored and that they're made whole and that the environment is made whole.  There's still a lot of work to do."
30,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, here's what you said in terms of the environmental impacts--impact.  Back in May, when you were last on MEET THE PRESS, I asked you about that.  This is what you said."
31,"(Videotape, May 30, 2010)"
32,MS. BROWNER:  This is probably the biggest environmental disaster we've ever faced in this country. 
33,(End videotape)
34,MR. GREGORY:  Does that still stand?  And what does that mean specifically?
35,"MS. BROWNER:  We had almost five million barrels of oil leak.  We've never seen anything like it before.  The idea that, you know, if you went down to the gulf--and I know you have--and asked people what they thought, they would absolutely agree this is the largest environmental
disaster.  And we responded accordingly, and we've been successful in removing a lot of the oil.  We're going to remain vigilant.  We've got to hold BP accountable for the claims, for the damages to the environment."
36,"MR. GREGORY:  But I'm asking you, the environmental impact, what specifically is the impact going forward, environmentally?"
37,"MS. BROWNER:  Well, we, we know that we had oil up in some of the sensitive marshes and the estuaries.  That can be cleaned to some degree. Some of the oil will have to dissipate naturally.  We need to monitor those estuaries to ensure the health of those estuaries, of the
fisheries.  While we've reopened some, some remain closed.  I mean, it--you can't put this much oil out there and not be concerned; and that's how we responded, with a great deal of concern."
38,MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk about BP's accountability.  How many barrels of oil were spilled? 
39,MS. BROWNER:  The estimates are 4.9 million barrels.  And that--those estimates are based on pressure tests that we were able to do when the new top hat was put on.
40,"MR. GREGORY:  BP doesn't commit to that figure, do they?"
41,"MS. BROWNER:  I think BP has been silent, but that doesn't matter.  We..."
42,MR. GREGORY:  But there's a reason they're silent.
43,MS. BROWNER:  ...will hold them accountable.
44,MR. GREGORY:  They will be held liable.
45,MS. BROWNER:  Because they pay a penalty.
46,MR. GREGORY:  They'll pay a penalty...
47,"MS. BROWNER:  Yes, yes."
48,MR. GREGORY:  ...depending on how much.
49,MS. BROWNER:  Absolutely.
50,MR. GREGORY:  So the government knows this answer for sure.
51,"MS. BROWNER:  Our scientists feel very confident in the answer.  I mean, again, we started with just satellite photos, then we were able to get the, you know, the ROV photos, and then, ultimately, the pressure tests. And it's based on those pressure tests that this number has been put forward."
52,MR. GREGORY:  Will the government pursue criminal negligence claims against BP to make that financial penalty as high as it can be? 
53,"MS. BROWNER:  I'm not going to comment on the Department of Justice investigation.  As you know, they have a large investigation under way. I will say this, BP will be held absolutely accountable."
54,"MR. GREGORY:  To the, to the full extent of the law."
55,MS. BROWNER:  Absolutely.
56,"MR. GREGORY:  Because you're suggesting here, by everything you're saying, that they were, indeed, negligent and that there should be a large financial penalty."
57,"MS. BROWNER:  Well, there will be a large financial penalty.  There'll also be a natural resource damages claims.  They will be responsible for paying to clean up the natural resource damages.  There's three ways in which they're held accountable.  One, for the economic losses, and there we were able to negotiate a $20 billion fund, and in the coming days, Mr.
Feinberg will launch that fund.  Secondly are the penalties, which will be significant.  And finally, the natural resource damages, which they will have to pay for."
58,MR. GREGORY:  How much of the penalty dollars should be returned directly to the Gulf Coast?
59,"MS. BROWNER:  Well, under the current law, it goes to the Treasury."
60,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
61,"MS. BROWNER:  We think it should be returned to the Gulf Coast,
obviously."
62,"MR. GREGORY:  How much?  Eighty percent?  As you know, that's what Gulf states senators want."
63,MS. BROWNER:  I think that makes a lot of sense.
64,MR. GREGORY:  So 80 percent is a reasonable figure.  Does the president commit himself to that?
65,"MS. BROWNER:  Well, we're going to have to work with Congress, you know. Congress has not been forthcoming in terms of passing a--the oil spill legislation.  The House did, but the Senate didn't.  We're going to have to work with them to make sure that the Gulf Coast communities see the benefits of this money."
66,"MR. GREGORY:  So--but the president, at least, supports the notion of majority of this penalty money being returned to the region."
67,"MS. BROWNER:  He absolutely supports the notion of returning it to the
region."
68,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about the moratorium.  The president, in his address to the nation, imposed the moratorium, said it was the right thing to do.  Now there is some talk that it might be lifted early.  Is that possible?"
69,"MS. BROWNER:  Well, the..."
70,"MR. GREGORY:  Now this is, I should say, a moratorium on deepwater
drilling..."
71,MS. BROWNER:  Right.
72,"MR. GREGORY:  ...in the gulf, 33 deepwater rigs in the gulf currently."
73,"MS. BROWNER:  So it's important to understand what the president has said. He said three things.  First of all, we have to understand what happened so we can make sure that all the safety measures are in place so it doesn't happen again.  Secondly, in the worst case scenario, if we did have another leak, we have to be able to contain it.  Now, we've learned a lot about how to contain it, and some of the other oil companies have come forth and said perhaps we should pre-stage the containment equipment.  We think that makes a lot of sense.  And then finally, we have to be able to clean it up.  We've learned a lot about how you clean
it up.  We've learned, ""How does the burning work, how does the skimming work, how does the booming work?"" You know, if we're able to answer those questions, then this pause in drilling can be lifted.  But until we answer those questions, we need to make sure that we keep the Gulf Coast community safe."
74,MR. GREGORY:  So what are the chances it gets lifted early?
75,"MS. BROWNER:  You know, I don't want to speculate on that.  The work is being done, the analysis is being done.  Michael Bromwich is at the Department of Interior doing his job.  You know, I'm going to let them do their job, and if it's appropriate, it'll be lifted."
76,MR. GREGORY:  Are you not satisfied with the answers that you're getting so far to those questions about safety?
77,"MS. BROWNER:  It's just that it's a very rigorous review that's under way, and, you know, they're in the middle of the review, so I just don't want to speculate.  We, we understand the importance of these jobs, but we also understand the importance of protecting the Gulf Coast and the communities."
78,MR. GREGORY:  You talk about all the work here being done for safety. Did the White House do any economic analysis about what a moratorium--what impact it would have on jobs in the Gulf Coast? 
79,"MS. BROWNER:  There is, there is an economic analysis being done.  It'll be ready later..."
80,"MR. GREGORY:  But it was never done before the moratorium was put in place? Because those who are down there say, ""You know what, the moratorium by the Obama administration is far worse than the spill itself."""
81,"MS. BROWNER:  Here's what we knew the minute the accident happened:  that if there was another accident of equal size, we didn't have the equipment to respond.  All the boats, all the resources were being used.  We had a close--over 6,000 vessels, we embedded private citizens into this effort. It was a massive undertaking, and if another accident were to occur, we would not have had the ability to respond.  And, you know, that formed a basis for putting a pause on drilling while we looked at the safety, while we looked at how we would contain it, ultimately, and then clean it up."
82,"MR. GREGORY:  Final question here.  The president said, in his address to the nation, this, about climate change legislation. "
83,"(Videotape, June 15, 2010)"
84,PRES. OBAMA:  The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now.  ...  The one approach I will not accept is inaction.  The one answer I will not settle for is the idea that this challenge is somehow too big and too difficult to meet.
85,(End videotape)
86,"MR. GREGORY:  He said he won't settle for inaction, and yet, there is
inaction."
87,MS. BROWNER:  Right.
88,MR. GREGORY:  Is it failure?
89,"MS. BROWNER:  We're deeply disappointed that we were not able to get clean energy legislation.  There's a tremendous opportunity for our country to lead the global clean energy revolution.  But that requires us to put in place the, the right laws, the right signals so that we build the wind turbines here, we build the solar panels, then we can ship them to China.  We're in danger of losing out."
90,MR. GREGORY:  I understand the arguments.  The president drew a line in the sand there.  Is he conceding defeat on this?
91,MS. BROWNER:  Not yet.  The Congress is coming back.  We will continue to see if we can get legislation.  We passed it in the House.  We'll continue to work in the Senate.
92,"MR. GREGORY:  Lame duck session, they could do it potentially there."
93,MS. BROWNER:  Potentially.
94,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we'll, we'll be watching.  Carol Browner, thank you very much as always."
95,MS. BROWNER:  Thank you.
96,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We turn now to the man trying to lead his party to victory this November, House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio.  He joins us this morning from Cincinnati."
97,"Leader Boehner, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS."
98,"REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH):  David, good morning."
99,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to continue on the, the Gulf Coast spill as we near completion of this, and you've heard Carol Browner's comments.  I want to pick up on holding BP accountable.  Do you think the government should pursue criminal negligence claims against BP?"
100,"REP. BOEHNER:  I think the government should do everything they possibly can to, to bring this crisis to an end; and that means going after BP, enforcing the laws that are on the books, and restoring the gulf to its original condition.  I think BP has stepped forward in terms of the money that they've put forward so far.  But there is the law, and they should be held accountable."
101,"MR. GREGORY:  The question, however, also extends to, in terms of revitalizing the Gulf Coast, this issue of the moratorium on deepwater drilling.  You heard Carol Browner concede the White House didn't do an economic analysis about what it would do to jobs and to the industries
along the Gulf Coast.  Should that moratorium be lifted by this point? "
102,"REP. BOEHNER:  I believe the moratorium should be lifted.  We've been drilling in the Gulf Coast now for 60 years.  There are 40,000 wells operating in the Gulf Coast.  There clearly was a mistake made with regard to this one well, but I think that we're risking 100,000 jobs in the Gulf Coast with the continuation of this moratorium, and I do believe that, that there are enough practices in place, enough safety precautions in place to allow this drilling to continue.  Because if we're serious about moving toward energy independence, we need to do all of the above, which includes exploration for more oil and gas in the United States of America."
103,"MR. GREGORY:  There seems to be some bipartisan agreement about this point: When it comes to the gulf oil spill and in terms of the, the permits being issued, there was a failure of regulation.  When it comes to the Wall Street collapse, the financial system collapse, a failure of regulation.  And yet, you said something in July that caught my attention about a moratorium on regulations.  You said, ""I think having a moratorium on new federal regulations is a great idea.  It sends a wonderful signal to the private sector that they're going to have some
breathing room."" Do you think that's what the private sector needs right now, is breathing room?"
104,"REP. BOEHNER:  I do think the private sector needs some breathing room. When you look at all of the, the uncertainty that's being created by the Democrats' agenda, they've got every employer in America, every investor in America scared to death, and they're frozen.  When you look at what happened on Wall Street, when you look at what happened in the gulf, it
wasn't that we didn't have enough regulations; what, what we didn't have was enough enforcement by the federal bureaucrats in charge of pursuing these things."
105,"The SEC could have done a lot more with regard to the financial meltdown, except they didn't.  It's pretty clear that those bureaucrats charged with inspecting these wells didn't do their job.  And so it's not more regulations. How about we enforce the ones we have now?"
106,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me talk about, on the subject of regulations and the broader economy, the job numbers that came out Friday were disappointing. The private sector job growth is anemic at best, and yet the president says he is not fearful of a so-called ""double-dip"" recession.  What do you say?"
107,"REP. BOEHNER:  Well, I'm concerned about the state of the economy.  It's pretty clear that over the last three months the economy has paused.  And it's also pretty clear the American people are still demanding and asking the question, ""Where are the jobs?"" And the reason we don't have new jobs is because of the job-killing agenda pursued by President Obama and his
allies in the Congress.  They really do, they have employers scared to death.  I've been all over my district over the last several days.  I was in a couple of my neighboring states.  I talked to a lot of employers who just are, are fearful of what's coming next out of Washington.  It's all
the spending, it's all the  debt. It's their national energy tax, they ant to call it cap and trade--more mandates, higher costs, more taxes. heir healthcare bill--more mandates, higher costs, higher taxes.  And if ll that did--isn't bad enough, they want to raise the taxes on the
American people."
108,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let's..."
109,REP. BOEHNER:  It's no wonder that employers are frozen.
110,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk about it.  It's interesting, you talk about the mportance of cutting the debt, the importance of cutting government pending, and you worry about the Democrats raising taxes.  The Bush--the bama administration wants to extend the Bush tax cuts only for those who ake less than $250,000, and he wants to let them expire for those
wealthy Americans making more than that.  You're opposed to that.  You ant to extend the tax cuts, and the Republican leadership does.  But lan Greenspan, who was on this program last week, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that's the wrong idea.  Here's what he said."
111,"(Videotape, last Sunday)"
112,"DR. ALAN GREENSPAN:  Look, I'm very much in favor of tax cuts, but not with borrowed money.  And the problem that we've gotten into in recent years is spending programs with borrowed money, tax cuts with borrowed money, and at the end of the day that proves disastrous.  And my view is I don't think we can play subtle policy here."
113,MR. GREGORY:  You don't agree with Republican leaders who say tax cuts pay for themselves.
114,DR. GREENSPAN:  They do not.
115,(End videotape)
116,"MR. GREGORY:  Leader Boehner, he puts it right to you."
117,"REP. BOEHNER:  The only way we're going to get our economy going again and solve our budget problems is to get the economy moving, get more people back to work where they can care for their own families, and begin to expand the tax rolls to bring more revenue to the federal government. And what we have to do is we have to get our arms around the spending
spree that's going on in Washington, D.C."
118,MR. GREGORY:  But Leader Boehner...
119,REP. BOEHNER:  That's the only way we solve the budget problems.
120,"MR. GREGORY:  ...I'm sorry, you're--that--you're not, you're not being responsive to a specific point, which is how can you be for cutting the deficit and also cutting taxes, as well, when they're not paid for? "
121,"REP. BOEHNER:  Listen, you can't raise taxes in the middle of a weak economy without risking the double-dip in this recession.  President Obama's favorite Republican economist, Mark Zandi, came out several weeks ago and made it clear that raising taxes at this point in, in the economy is a very bad idea."
122,MR. GREGORY:  But do you agree that tax cuts cannot be paid for...
123,REP. BOEHNER:  You cannot balance the budget without a...
124,"MR. GREGORY:  But tax cuts are not paid for, is that correct?"
125,REP. BOEHNER:  I am not for raising taxes on the American people in a soft economy.
126,"MR. GREGORY:  That's not the question, Leader Boehner.  The question..."
127,REP. BOEHNER:  And the people that the president wants to tax...
128,"MR. GREGORY:  ...is, are tax cuts paid for or not?"
129,"REP. BOEHNER:  Listen, what you're trying to do is get into this Washington game and their funny accounting over there.  You cannot get the economy going again by raising taxes on those people who we expect to create jobs in America and to get the economy going again.  If we want to solve the budget problem, we've got to have a healthy economy and we have to get our arms around the runaway spending that's going on in Washington, D.C."
130,"MR. GREGORY:  I just want to clarify this.  I mean, if you--I'm relying on what Chairman Greenspan said.  Maybe--if you're accusing him of funny Washington games.  He says that tax cuts that aren't paid for are not--they are not cutting the deficit, that they are not actually paid for, it's borrowed money.  And so do you believe tax cuts pay for themselves or not?"
131,"REP. BOEHNER:  I do believe that we've got to get more money in the hands of small businesses and American families to get our economy going again, and the only way to get that economy going again is to do that and to get our arms around the spending."
132,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  One of the ways you talk about getting your arms around the spending was something you suggested back in June, and that is that Social Security, the retirement age, ought to be raised to the age of 70.  Is that something that the GOP will campaign on in the fall?"
133,"REP. BOEHNER:  David, I think it's time for the American people to have an adult conversation about the problems that we face.  These entitlement programs serve tens of millions of Americans, and they're critically important.  But we also know that these programs are, are unsustainable in their current form.  And I really do think it's time that we sit down
and we talk to the American people together about how we solve them.  And I think we need to bring Democrats and Republicans together in order to solve this problem."
134,MR. GREGORY:  And so you favor raising the retirement age?
135,"REP. BOEHNER:  David, there are a lot of options about how you solve this, but I don't want to get the cart before the horse.  I think it's important to have this conversation.  It's going to be a difficult conversation, but it's time to have it and it's time to come up with some
solutions that are done in a bipartisan way to help address these problems."
136,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me talk about the, the midterm race.  Several months ago, back in March, you thought it would be a steep climb for Republicans to retake the House.  What do you say today?"
137,"REP. BOEHNER:  I continue to believe that it is a challenge for us to take back the House.  But we've got candidates, more candidates than we've ever had.  We have 430 districts with one or more Republican candidates in the race.  We have the--better candidates than we ever had. But we want to earn back the majority in order to renew our effort to go
after a smaller, less costly, and more accountable federal government in Washington, D.C."
138,"MR. GREGORY:  But you still think it's a challenge.  It was interesting. The president's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, as you know, said on this program that he thought it was possible that Republicans could take over the House. He, he now believes that's not the case.  That caused quite a stir.  What impact do you think that had?  And yet, it hasn't changed your view about the challenges that Republicans face."
139,"REP. BOEHNER:  Well, David, listen, it's only August.  There are a lot of things that can happen between now and Election Day.  Is it possible? Yes, it certainly is possible.  There are a hundred seats in play around the country, and 94 of them are held by Democrat members.  I've, I've been all over my district, I've been through a lot of other districts.
The American people are screaming at the top of their lungs to Washington, ""Stop!  Stop the spending, stop the job-killing policies."" And yet, Democrats in Washington refuse to listen to the American people. Republicans have been listening all summer with our program America
Speaking Out."
140,MR. GREGORY:  Well...
141,REP. BOEHNER:  We're listening.
142,"MR. GREGORY:  ...you, you..."
143,"REP. BOEHNER:  We're going to come forward with our, with our agenda right after Labor Day."
144,MR. GREGORY:  Right after Labor Day.  Why wait until then?  Why not do it now?
145,"REP. BOEHNER:  I think it's important that we listen to the American people. It's not about what I think, it's about what the American people think.  And at americaspeakingout.com, hundreds of thousands of people have given us ideas about what Washington should be doing.  People have voted on other people's ideas.  And if people want to go to americaspeakingout.com, they can participate in this.  And out of this listening, we will have a governing agenda to, to get this country... "
146,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  But Leader Boehner...
147,REP. BOEHNER:  ...this country back on track.
148,"MR. GREGORY:  Leader Boehner, you--but you are certainly campaigning to be the next speaker.  As a matter of fact, you can go on boehnerforspeaker.org and order a mug, among other items, to support that effort.  And yet, the president of the United States is going to
fundraisers around the country and slamming Republicans.  This is one of the things that he says:"
149,"(Videotape, Monday)"
150,"PRES. OBAMA:  They have not come up with a single, solitary new idea to address the challenges of the American people.  They don't have a single idea that's different from George Bush's ideas.  Not one. "
151,(End videotape)
152,MR. GREGORY:  What do you say to that?
153,"REP. BOEHNER:  When I handed Nancy Pelosi the gavel 18 months ago, I said that if Republicans had to oppose our Democrat colleagues or our new president, it was our obligation to tell the American people how we would do it differently.  Every time we've opposed our Democratic colleagues, we've offered what we thought was a better solution.  Each and every
time.  And when we roll out our agenda, we're going to roll out our solutions to solve the problem of the joblessness in America to get Americans back to work, and how we would control spending."
154,MR. GREGORY:  Do you want--will you offer specific spending cuts to offset the money that's lost by extending tax cuts?
155,"REP. BOEHNER:  Listen, we've offered all kinds of spending cuts.  As a matter of fact, Paul Ryan and Jeb Hensarling, two leaders on our budget committee, have offered $1.3 trillion worth of spending cuts.  We've offered these to the president, asked the president to send recisions to the Congress, and we offered to work with him to enact those recisions.
Why don't we stop the stimulus spending?  There's still about $400 billion or $500 billion of the stimulus plan that has not been spent. Why don't we stop it.  It's not working.  Secondly, why don't we make sure that we get all the TARP funds back and use it to pay down the
deficit.  Why don't we put a cap on discretionary spending at much lower levels than what we have today.  It's time to stop the spending spree in Washington, D.C."
156,"MR. GREGORY:  The president, of course, has called for a cap on discretionary spending."
157,"REP. BOEHNER:  I'm talking about a real cap, like at 2008 levels, not at 2010 levels."
158,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Let me ask you about a couple of other topics, including the ethics scandal surrounding Congressman Charlie Rangel. There's news out this morning that there was a deal that was being discussed and that it was Republicans who stood in the way.  They wanted a trial.  Is that accurate?"
159,"REP. BOEHNER:  I would have no idea.  Under the rules of the House, the Ethics Committee proceedings are private.  There--this is the only committee in the Congress where you have five Republicans and five Democrats.  And from what I read in the press, the charges against Mr. Rangel were brought by two Republicans and two Democrats together.  But this isn't about Charlie Rangel, this is about Nancy Pelosi's biggest failure.  She said that it was time to drain the swamp.  Not once during this entire two-year proceeding has she called for Chairman Rangel to step down from his post as the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee."
160,MR. GREGORY:  Is that what you're doing this morning?
161,REP. BOEHNER:  And really...
162,MR. GREGORY:  Should he?
163,"REP. BOEHNER:  He already stepped, stepped down but he did it on his own, and, frankly, it was much too late."
164,"MR. GREGORY:  Should he step down from Congress, from his seat?"
165,"REP. BOEHNER:  I think that's for Charlie to decide.  But I do think it's time to hold members of Congress accountable.  The American people deserve to have members of Congress observe the highest of ethical standards, and it has not happened.  I told my colleagues 18 months ago, when I became their leader, that I was going to hold members accountable, and I have."
166,"MR. GREGORY:  Leader Boehner, one final question that's been kind of a hot-button issue this week and that is calls by some Republicans to amend the Constitution to change the 14th Amendment, which provides birthright citizenship if you're born in this country.  As a matter of fact, on the RNC's Web site, the 14th Amendment is listed as an accomplishment of the
Republicans, one of the major pieces of its legacy over time.  Do you support efforts to have the 14th Amendment amended at this point?"
167,"REP. BOEHNER:  Well, David, I'm not the expert on this issue.  I have read the--these comments here over this past week.  But I think that we do have--there is a problem.  To provide an incentive for illegal immigrants to come here so that their children can be U.S. citizens does, in fact, draw more people to our country.  I, I do think that it's time
for us to secure our borders and enforce the law, and allow this conversation about the 14th Amendment to continue. "
168,MR. GREGORY:  But do you have a position on it?
169,"REP. BOEHNER:  Listen, I think it's worth considering.  But it's a serious problem that affects our country.  And in certain parts of our country, clearly, our schools, our hospitals, are being overrun by illegal immigrants, a lot of whom came here just so their children could
become U.S. citizens."
170,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Leader Boehner...
171,REP. BOEHNER:  They should do it--they should do it the legal way.
172,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Leader Boehner, we'll leave it there.  Thank you very much for your views."
173,REP. BOEHNER:  Thank you.
174,"MR. GREGORY:  And up next, the battle lines for the midterm election are now drawn.  You heard it, the economy, tax cuts, gay marriage, immigration, and the war in Afghanistan, all up for debate.  Next, former Democratic Congressman Harold Ford, Republican Congressman Mike Pence, Vanity Fair's Todd Purdum, and NBC's Andrea Mitchell, only on MEET THE PRESS."
175,(Announcements)
176,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up, our political roundtable weighs in on what has been a long and hot summer politically for the president.  How will voters react in November?  After this brief commercial break. "
177,(Announcements)
178,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We're back, joined now by host of MSNBC's ""Andrea Mitchell Reports,"" NBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent, Andrea Mitchell; Vanity Fair's national editor, Todd Purdum; former congressman from Tennessee and the author of the new book ""More Davids than Goliaths,"" Democrat Harold Ford; and chairman of the House Republican Conference, Indiana congressman, Mike Pence."
179,"Well, welcome to all of you.  There's a lot to get to and the economy is still the top issue and something I talked a lot with Leader Boehner about.  First of all, the--in the context of the president's performance, here is his approval ratings as measured by USA Today/Gallup this week, approval at 41 percent, disapproval at 53 percent.  Charlie Cook, who's
the influential editor of the Cook Political Report, writes this about the economy, that it is ""a millstone around Democrats' necks, and there is not a lot they can do about it."" Even President Obama, speaking to a small business on Friday, acknowledged this:"
180,"(Videotape, Friday)"
181,PRES. OBAMA:  Progress needs to come faster.  Our job is to make sure that happens.
182,(End videotape)
183,"MR. GREGORY:  So then, Congressman Ford, what do Democrats do for economic growth to get people back to work?"
184,"FMR. REP. HAROLD FORD JR. (D-TN):  I think two things.  First, we've done a lot.  They've preserved the U.S. car industry, they saved the financial industry from going over the brink, they passed the big stimulus.  The problem is, a majority of Americans aren't experiencing the benefit of these--this, this legislation yet, which is why I think two or three other things have to be done.  First, I'm a believer you have to extend some of the tax cuts.  The middle class tax cuts, probably the capital gains and dividend tax cuts, and you probably want to phase in the top rate increases for the wealthiest of Americans.  Democrats often compare Warren Buffett, take--they take his language in support of reducing some of these taxes, and they compare him to everyone else.  Someone making $251,000 a year is very different than Warren Buffett.  I think we have to be sensitive to that."
185,"Two, provide more certainty around the regulatory structure.  Broadband and power grids are going to be built out.  These big companies with big, big chunks of cash need to know that the--what the rules are going to be going forward."
186,"And three, I happen to think that the president ought to adopt some of the recommendations from his deficit reduction commission.  I heard Leader Boehner, evidently there's some Republican interest in raising the retirement age.  Some of these things have to be put on the table.  The American people expect it, and they continue to watch a Washington that
is broken, that Todd wrote so well about, I think will hurt my party in the fall if we don't begin to do some of these things. "
187,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, we're going to get to Todd's piece, but Congressman Pence, I mean, this is the tension that I got out with Leader Bennett--Boehner.  Republicans want more tax cuts.  It seems to me they acknowledge that they are not paid for, and yet, at the same time, they
want tax cuts, but they're so worried about the deficit.  How do you resolve that tension?"
188,"REP. MIKE PENCE (R-IN):  Well, I think the, the way you resolve it is you focus on jobs.  I got to tell you, when I'm home in Muncie, Indiana, people are asking the question, ""Where are the jobs?"" I mean, we have more than 14 million Americans unemployed.  National unemployment is 9.5 percent.  Clearly, the economic policies of this administration, however well-intentioned, have failed.  And we've got to do something different. And it's not, it's not just about preserving the tax relief of 2001 and 2003, David.  It is, it is also about beginning to embrace the kind of spending discipline and reform that will..."
189,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Congressman, you're asking Americans to..."
190,REP. PENCE:  ...that will restore confidence to markets.
191,"MR. GREGORY:  ...to believe the Republicans will have spending discipline when you're saying extend the tax cuts that aren't paid for and cut the deficit.  How is that a consistent, credible message? "
192,"REP. PENCE:  Well, I understand the credibility problem, David.  You know that during the first six years of this decade, I spent most of my time fighting against runaway spending under Republicans.  I opposed No Child Left Behind, I opposed the Medicare prescription drug bill, I opposed the Wall Street bailout.  What the American people are starting to see is that Republican, Republicans on Capitol Hill get it and the Democrats, from the White House to Capitol Hill, just don't get.  You just heard Carol Browner here on the show say that they're, they're intending, I think she said ""possibly,"" to use the lame duck session to pass a national
energy tax.  I mean, that, that is, that is outrageous.  What the American people know is necessary to get this economy moving again is get federal spending under control and preserve and promote the kind of policies and taxes that'll, that'll create jobs."
193,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But I just want to be clear.  So if you want more tax cuts, you would be very specific in saying how they'd be offset with spending cuts, as well, since they will not be paid for.  You acknowledge tax cuts being extended cannot be paid for, it would be borrowed money."
194,"REP. PENCE:  Well, no.  I, I, I don't acknowledge that.  I mean, the reality is that I think it's apples and oranges.  It's something that John Boehner was talking to you about.  Here in Washington, D.C., they, they talk about tax cuts the same way they talk about spending increases as though the government owned all of the money.  They say, ""Are they paid for?"" Well, I think, I think deciding on a government spending increase is very different on whether or not we allow the American people to keep more of their hard-earned tax dollars. But, as John Boehner just said, the most important thing right now is to get this economy moving
again, to create jobs, and to get federal spending under control."
195,"REP. FORD:  This is, this is..."
196,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Harold, do they--do Republicans have a problem here?"
197,"REP. FORD:  They do.  This is the only reason that Democrats in my party, we have a fighting chance still, in the fall, of holding majorities in both the House and the Senate.  Mike and I are friends, but this argument is not credible.  And I think, I think most Americans will listen and
say, ""Well, you can't have A, B, C, and D and say you don't need B, C, and D.  You've got to either say you're going to cut taxes and find some spending cuts."" I think we ought to reform long-term entitlement spending in the country, but you can't out of one side of your mouth say, ""Yes, we're for tax cuts, we're for spending discipline, and we're for bringing
down the debt."" Everyone's got to have an adult conversation here, and that's not, that's not happening.  Where I do agree with Mike is this, jobs is the issue.  And if we find ourselves in late October, early November when the polling places are getting ready to open and close and
people don't feel better about the economy, his party's in a pretty good position to win a lot of seats."
198,"MR. GREGORY:  Andrea Mitchell, bigger picture here beyond the tax debate. You had Secretary Geithner writing a New York Times editorial saying..."
199,MS. ANDREA MITCHELL:  Yeah.
200,"MR. GREGORY:  ...look, we're on a path toward growth.  And yet look at the battering that the president's getting over the fact that there are not jobs. And he's out there saying, ""Look, we've got to show more progress faster."" This is a big problem for Democrats."
201,"MS. MITCHELL:  It's a big problem for Democrats because nothing is going to happen to really improve the jobs picture before November.  It's just not going to happen.  That's what we know from these latest data.  So, given that, he's got to go on the offense and make a credible political argument and maybe an argument that goes beyond economics and just gets
to, I mean, what the White House is saying is, ""Let's just beat up on George W. Bush."" I'm not sure that's credible so many years after Bush left office.  But they can talk about the inheritance, what they came into office with.  And the problem that Congressman Ford identified is that all the things that they accomplished are unpopular with most
Americans.  If you talk about the stimulus package, they have not really persuaded people that it worked because the jobs aren't there, the tangible evidence isn't there.  And they, they don't like the bank bailout, even though most experts would tell you that it was necessary,
despite the--how unpopular it is.  And Congressman Pence..."
202,"REP. FORD:  And the fact that the bank has to pay the money back, which is also an important fact that's overlooked. "
203,"MS. MITCHELL:  And that they have paid the money back.  Congressman Pence is strongly opposed to it, as he's just, as he's just described. Interesting that the majority--that the minority leader, Boehner, opened  the door on the retirement age.  That was a very big opening and one that, that--I don't know if Congressman Pence agrees with it because some
Republicans may want--not want to follow the leader down that road."
204,"MR. GREGORY:  Do, do you agree with that?  Should it be raised to 70?"
205,"REP. PENCE:  Look, I, I think, I think it is absolutely imperative that we, that we address all of the federal budget and have--and, and I like Harold's comment.  We, we miss Democrats like Harold on Capitol Hill these days.  Have an adult conversation about domestic spending and about entitlements."
206,MR. GREGORY:  But we keep talking about all these adults conversations.
207,"REP. PENCE:  This government, this government has--Todd's point..."
208,MR. GREGORY:  It's a narrow question which is you're either for raising the retirement age or you're not.  You can have a childlike conversation about it and just say whether you're for it or not.
209,"REP. PENCE:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look, look, I am for reforming our public entitlements for Americans who are far away from retirement.  We need to keep promises to seniors that have been made..."
210,MR. GREGORY:  But put everything on the table.
211,"REP. PENCE:  ...make sure that people that--who are counting on Medicare or Social Security have the benefits they have.  But for younger Americans, absolutely yes, we ought to bring..."
212,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, but put it on..."
213,"REP. PENCE:  ...we ought to bring real reform for, for the sake of, of future generations of Americans to get spending under control."
214,"MR. GREGORY:  Let--Todd Purdum, let me bring you into this, I want to get to your piece in just a moment.  But you know, what we're talking about a lot, whether there's a debt commission that talks about the tough choices that have to be made, is Washington in a position to make some of these really tough choices about taxes, about spending, about other ways to create jobs?"
215,"MR. TODD PURDUM:  Well, it would seem that--not particularly.  I mean, the, the deficit commission's a good example."
216,MS. MITCHELL:  Exactly.
217,"MR. PURDUM:  That was appointed by President Obama because Congress refused to pass a--create a commission that would have binding power because of fears on the part of Republicans that it would lead to higher taxes, and on the part of Democrats that it would cut social programs. So the president appointed this advisory commission instead.  And Al Simpson and Erskine Bowles are, you know, taking hits that--you know, they've been working for the past 10 weeks. I, I saw Senator Simpson in Wyoming last week.  He said he'd been here once a week for 10 weeks, you know.  And the notion that a group of some private citizens have to deal with this issue is, is, is a symptom of what's wrong, I think."
218,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you think, Congressman Pence, that a debt commission will have any teeth?  On this program, I heard the head of the Senate re-election committee say, ""Well, we want to wait before proposing spending cuts until we see the debt commission."" You all have been around a long time.  You know what you'd like to cut.  You've been against
spending for a long time.  Do you have specific ideas of what you'd like to see cut to bring the deficit under control? "
219,"REP. PENCE:  Look, we, we've got some terrific people on the Republican side working on the debt commission, and they're working in good faith on it.  But, but why, why the president imposed a debt commission that wouldn't report until after the election was a bit telling.  I mean, the, the Republicans are not going to support an effort to use the debt
commission as an excuse to raise taxes, to introduce a value-added tax. But let, let me get to the point, Todd, Todd wrote that provocative article in Vanity Fair about Washington being broken.  He talked about the president's effort to transcend politics in Washington.  And, and,
your, your, your reporting suggested that the president made a concerted effort to reach out to Republicans early on.  I got to tell you, this administration hasn't sought to transcend the politics of Washington, D.C.  This has been the ""my way or the highway"" administration. From the stimulus bill forward, Democrats on Capitol Hill and in this administration have slammed the door on Republican ideas, have slammed the door on bipartisan proposals, and, you know--and again, I just saw on your program again, this morning, the president saying even though we
handed the president a book of Republicans solutions in February at our retreat and he acknowledged that we've offered policy alternatives to stimulus, to budget, to energy, to health care, the president's back to that old saw that Republicans have no ideas.  And, and I think that's the reason his approval rating is plummeting."
220,MS. MITCHELL:  The reason the president appointed the debt commission was because some senators who had supported it... 
221,REP. FORD:  Republican senators...
222,"MS. MITCHELL:  ...including mostly Republican senators, abandoned it.  So they couldn't pass the legislation which would have a debt commission with teeth."
223,"REP. PENCE:  Well, I think there's a real concern, though, about, you know, going back to Andrews Air Force base again.  What was it, back in 1990 again, all--everybody gets all worried about, about spending and, and deficits and debt.  And all of a sudden, they come back from Andrews Air Force base with a tax increase under George W. Bush and--or George
Herbert Walker Bush, excuse me.  I think Republicans are very, very concerned, I think properly, that this, this debt commission pushed into the lame duck after, after the elections is going to be a vehicle to try and raise taxes on the American people..."
224,REP. FORD:  This is precisely what...
225,REP. PENCE:  ...which is a profoundly wrong idea.
226,"REP. FORD:  This is why Todd's piece is so, so striking because this is
what the American people are so upset about.  They hear all this insider talk about what you guys are doing, what this guy--these guys, we're worried about them doing.  They just want answers.  If you're without a job or you've taken an job where you're making less than you were before, you just want leadership. Now, my party happens to be in the majority,
and they will probably end up having to make a stronger defense than Republicans.  But you guys have an obligation and a burden to lead as well."
227,REP. PENCE:  Right.
228,"REP. FORD:  To say the president hasn't, hasn't reached out to Republicans is just not true.  We took the public option out of the healthcare bill in order to win some Republican support.  That didn't go very well.  On interview, we've taken cap and trade..."
229,REP. PENCE:  To win Republican support.
230,"REP. FORD:  To win some Republican support because Republicans said they didn't want it in there.  We all would agree there's a healthcare crisis--health insurance crisis.  Two, with regard to energy reform that Democrats have taken out the cap and trade title in order to try to win Republican support.  That still hasn't worked.  The main person they--the big Republican on the bill, Lindsey Graham, is not only not supporting him, he's now suggesting that we rescind the 14th Amendment all in an effort to try to advance the political conversation about immigration."
231,"MR. GREGORY:  Let, let, let me get in here because..."
232,REP. FORD:  That's wrong.  That's wrong.
233,"MR. GREGORY:  ...here, without further ado, is actually a portion of the aforementioned Todd Purdum piece in Vanity Fair.  This is the spread--you got a lot of buildup here, now here's the payoff.  So here's what you write.  ""The modern presidency--Barack Obama's presidency--has become a job of such gargantuan size, speed, and complexity as to be all but
unrecognizable to most of the previous chief executives.  The sheer growth of the federal government, the paralysis of Congress, the systemic corruption brought on by lobbying, the trivialization of the `news'"" by the ""media have made today's Washington a depressing and dysfunctional place.  They have shaped and at times hobbled the presidency itself."""
234,"MR. PURDUM:  Well, I think that's probably, you know, almost stating the obvious at some level.  One of the, one of the challenges of doing this piece was to find a way to get at some of these problems that are reflected in the daily news coverage, but not really, but not really
explored.  And I think, you know, the Obama top team all talks about the speed and the sort of velocity that happens here.  You know, I covered the White House 15 years ago, and I, I confess that the origin of this piece is when I would go to the briefing early on in the Obama
administration, the daily press briefing, I found it--I couldn't imagine trying to work in the White House or cover a White House in this modern media environment, particularly where everything moves so quickly and everything rises to the top every hour, regardless of its importance,
just because it's new."
235,"MR. GREGORY:  And the question of redistricting as well, Andrea, where you've got House members who are in increasingly safe districts around the country and where there's really not much of a premium put on compromise."
236,"MS. MITCHELL:  No premium at all put on compromise.  You've never had, not only in the House, but particularly in the Senate, a group that is less motivated.  Because they're worried about the wings--of primary challenges on their wings, they're less motivated to work in the middle. The kind of people that you now see talking about the debt commission,
Erskine Bowles and Al Simpson, used to work together and still try to work together.  But you don't, in--and particularly in the Senate, have any motivation to try to work on legislative solutions there. "
237,"MR. GREGORY:  I've got to do two things very quickly.  Congressman Pence, the issue of Charlie Rangel.  There does not appear to be a deal that's moving forward, and, and there are some reports that Republicans want to see an ethics trial go forward.  What is your view on whether he ought to step down from his seat at this point or pursue a trial?"
238,"REP. PENCE:  If the allegations against Charlie Rangel are true, he should step down from Congress.  But only Charlie Rangel knows if that's the case. We're in the trial phase right now.  The opportunity for a settlement when two Republicans and two Democrats on the subcommittee were examining these charges, it has gone by the boards.  And, and I
really do believe that we ought to let, let Charlie Rangel have his day in court and let the process work."
239,"MR. GREGORY:  Harold, there's a lot of pressure on him from the White House down.  What's the talk up in New York City?"
240,"REP. FORD:  In New York, he continues to enjoy support from big and important quarters.  He had a birthday party last night, which I understand Mayor Bloomberg said he was going to attend.  I don't know if he did attend or not."
241,MR. GREGORY:  A lot of other supporters did not go.
242,"REP. FORD:  And some, some others did not go.  I think Mike's about right on this.  If, if Charlie Rangel, whom I've known a very, very long time, wants to have a trial and defend himself, he has every right to do that. We should not ignore the fact this will--this certainly has a political
impact.  I think it contributes to the, the, the narrative that people, or that thinking people, have about Washington that it's just not working.  And I can only hope that what--if it happens that it happens quickly."
243,MR. GREGORY:  Andrea...
244,"REP. PENCE:  Actually, though, David, real quickly, on this point of Washington not working, the, the, the problems of this administration are not because of the media, they're not because of lobbyists, they're certainly not because of decisive Republican minorities on Capitol Hill. The problems of this administration is this administration and Democrats in Washington are not listening to the American people.  On the stimulus, on the national energy tax, on Obamacare, they have rolled over the will of the majority of the American people again and again and again."
245,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Well, that's, that's, that's a..."
246,"REP. PENCE:  And they're--and now they're blaming the messengers for
that."
247,"MR. GREGORY:  OK.  I want to move on, otherwise that's, obviously, thats a debatable point to, to, to post around the table.  But I do--Andrea, I want to talk about Afghanistan.  Some horrific deaths of aid workers, their bodies coming back to America just earlier today, including from Afghanistan--excuse me--Tom Little, who was a doctor who was working over there.  These were aid workers who went out in a very dangerous part of the country in the north and were apparently killed by the Taliban.  This is a tough story to watch and just underscores how dangerous the country is."
248,"MS. MITCHELL:  It's horrific, and the fact that the Taliban in the north felt empowered to go after these workers.  Until now, the real threat was in the south, and perhaps the Taliban are being pushed north, the, the threat is going north.  The fact is, Richard Engel, our own chief foreign correspondent, reported last night on ""Nightly News"" that he talked to
Dr. Karen Woo, to one of those workers, one of those doctors, and she came to the NBC bureau and wanted to bring a camera with her.  So it's..."
249,MR. GREGORY:  But they thought it was just too dangerous.  Yeah.
250,"MS. MITCHELL:  And this is exactly what, what Hillary Clinton has been trying to do.  More civilian projects..."
251,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
252,MS. MITCHELL:  ...not viable.
253,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Thank you very much.  We'll leave it there. We'll be right back.

        Announcer:  From Afghanistan, this is a special edition of MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory.
    "
1,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We have come to Kabul at a critical moment of this war. Nine years into the conflict, President Obama has doubled down, surging U.S. forces in order to root the insurgency and help the government of Hamid Karzai, a government ripe with corruption, stand up on its own.  The man behind this new strategy is General David Petraeus, the commander behind the successful surge in Iraq.  Petraeus has taken over command of U.S. and coalition forces here after General Stan McChrystal was fired by President Obama for publicly airing his grievances with the war effort.  General Petraeus is speaking out for the first time, and exclusively to us, about all of the big issues in this conflictthe publics frustration with the war, the strength of the Taliban, the government of Hamid Karzai here in Afghanistan, the expected leaking of new secret war documents on the Internet, and whether President Obamas July of 2011 withdrawal timeline will hold."
2,At the heart of his challenge is the question we will explore in this special hour:  Is nation building possible in the badlands of Afghanistan?
3,GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS:  And begin.  (He does push-ups)
4,"MR. GREGORY:  At 57, General David Petraeus is easily Americas most famous warrior.  On this morning we find him in the middle of physical training as this fiercely competitive four-star general works over soldiers half his age..."
5,"GEN. PETRAEUS: Good morning, Marie. How are you? "
6,MR. GREGORY:  ...with the same intensity as he works the war plan.  Despite his reputation for taking on the toughest jobs... 
7,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Sit down, please."
8,MR. GREGORY:  ...General Petraeus admits he had his doubts about this assignment.
9,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Obviously that crosses your mind and, you know, to be candid, I thought Id sort of done my last one of this type, but its a privilege to do it with the tremendous team that we have out here."
10,MR. GREGORY:  He recalled the candid one-on-one conversation he had with President Obama the day he was tapped for the job.
11,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, we talked about literally the, again, the importance of the mission, the importance of, of our commitment to it, talked about the way ahead, talked about the various dynamics that are at play here that obviously give impressions about our commitment and so forth.  I didnt come out here to, to carry out a graceful exit or something like that.  I, I came out here committed to achieving our objectives and doing everything that we can to, to doing that."
12,"MR. GREGORY:  As the former head of Central Command, General Petraeus oversaw the war strategy."
13,GEN. PETRAEUS: Good morning. How are you? 
14,"MR. GREGORY:  Now, as the commanding general on the ground, hes clear-eyed about how hard this mission is. "
15,GEN. PETRAEUS:  We have to achieve a consensus in...
16,"MR. GREGORY:  His morning briefing, normally closed to cameras, includes a thorough battlefield report.  The general seizes on word of a Taliban attack on a mosque near the border with Pakistan, telling an adviser to get the word out to the local press."
17,GEN. PETRAEUS:  And this damage to the mosque is a good one to hang around the neck of the Taliban.
18,(Greeting Afghans) Salaam alaikum.  How are you?
19,"MR. GREGORY:  He is a strategist, a student of the conflict, and savvy enough to handle bottom-line questions very delicately."
20,You always say youre a realist...
21,GEN. PETRAEUS:  Yep.
22,MR. GREGORY:  ...so are we winning or losing here?
23,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Were making progress, and progress is winning, if you will, but it takes the accumulation of a lot of progress ultimately, needless to say, to win overall, and thats going to be a long-term proposition, without question."
24,"MR. GREGORY:  You faced this before, theres a Washington clock, and there is talk of a deadline, July 2011, when forces are supposed to begin to come out. Is your job here now as commander to try to slow down that Washington clock?"
25,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, I think our job is, again, to show those in Washington that there is progress being made, and to do that weve got to build on the progress that has been established so far because theres certainly nothing like irreversible momentum.  What we have are areas of progress, weve got to link those together, extend them and, and then build on it because, of course, the security progress, as you noted earlier, is the foundation for everything else, for the governance progress, the economic progress, rule-of-law progress and so forth.  Obviously, they influence security as well.  They can either reinforce it or they can undermine it.  And the, and the trick is to get all of it moving so that youre spiraling upward where one initiative reinforces another."
26,"MR. GREGORY:  General Petraeus says he supports the beginning of troop withdrawal next July, but its a qualified response to a highly charged issue back in Washington."
27,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Vice President Biden has also commented on it.  He said recently, I think, it could be as little as a couple of thousand troopers who go home next July.  Again, that remains to be seen, and it would be premature to have any kind of assessment at this juncture about what we may or may not be able to transition.  What the president very much wants from me, and, and what we talked about in the Oval Office is the responsibility of a military commander on the ground to provide as best professional military advice, leave the politics to him.  Certainly Im aware of the context within which I offer that advice, but that just informs the advice, it doesnt drive it.  The situation on the ground drives it.  Thats what he wants, thats what he, he told me to provide, and thats what I will provide."
28,MR. GREGORY:  You...
29,GEN. PETRAEUS:  Thats what I owe the country and our troopers who are fighting hard on the ground.
30,"MR. GREGORY:  But youll take a hard look at this, and youll make a determination about when Americas footprint should be diminished, when thats appropriate?"
31,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Absolutely.  Yeah.  And again, as he has said, as NATO officials have said, conditions-based, and thats a real key element of this. And then we have since drawn up a number of other principles and guidelines which weve provided up our operational chain of command."
32,"MR. GREGORY:  But the level of U.S. troops is not the most pressing concern on the ground.  The biggest obstacle?  Rampant corruption in the Afghan government.  President Hamid Karzai has promised a crackdown, but U.S. officials await results and have grown more suspect since he began to interfere with a U.S. anti-corruption task force.  U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry defends Karzai now, but last fall during the surge debate, he privately warned that Karzai could not be trusted."
33,"And my, my direct question is, you made it very clear you did not trust him as a partner in this debate.  Now, that may not have been a view that, you know, you wanted public, but there it is.  Have you changed your view about that, and based on what?"
34,"MR. KARL EIKENBERRY:  WeDavid, we have a very good cooperation with the government of Afghanistan to work at the challenges we have here of helping to build, a, a capable government.  This is a hard task, and my role here as the United States ambassador is to take forward the presidents strategy here. Weve got a very clear strategy, David.  weve gotfor the first time, weve got the proper resources.  Weve got an array of, I think, good programs here in working with the Afghan government and their law enforcement sector, their judicial sector; and we remain, we remain cautiously optimistic of our ability to make progress."
35,"MR. GREGORY:  During our visit with General Petraeus, he focused on examples of that progress:  security gains in the center of the country."
36,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  And you can see, again, a fair amount of construction thats gone on down here."
37,"MR. GREGORY:  We accompanied him to Wardak Province near Kabul, fly over the sprawling capital city, a much safer city than Baghdad was when he assumed command there."
38,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  That was a tough environment, you know, 50, 60 attacks per day as well during that time, in addition to these car bombs.  Now, touch wood, there are periodic attacks in Kabul; some of them are sensational horrific attacks, but the frequency is vastly less, you know, typically in a six- to eight-week cycle."
39,MR. GREGORY:  The general speaks of expanding security out from Kabul using the metaphor of an oil spot that grows larger and larger on the map.
40,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, the oil, the oil spot, if you will, is a, is a term in counterinsurgency literature that connotes a peaceful area, secure area.  So what youre trying to do is to always extend that, to push that out.  Of course, down in Helmand Province what we sought to do was to build an oil spot that would encompass the six central districts of Helmand Province, including Marjah and then others, and then to just keep pushing that out, ultimately to connect it over with the oil spot that is being developed around Kandahar City.  Kabul, a hugean entire province, not just the cityall but one district in Kabul, by the way, has Afghan security forces in the lead."
41,Unidentified Man:  This is Governor Fidai.
42,GOV.  FIDAI:  Salaam.
43,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Thank you, Governor."
44,GOV.  FIDAI:  Welcome to Wardak.
45,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, tashakur.  Ramadan mubarak."
46,GOV.  FIDAI:  Thank you very much.
47,GEN. PETRAEUS:  Its an honor to see you.
48,"MR. GREGORY:  In Wardak, Petraeus is greeted warmly by the provincial governor.  Security is vastly improved here, and now officials see the area as an emerging model for development projects and good government."
49,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Now, what is this right over here?"
50,"GOV.  FIDAI:  Oh, this is a..."
51,MR. GREGORY:  Counterinsurgency at work.
52,"The generals visit to Wardak Province today was in part to underline the, the importance of that security bubble being extended from outside Kabul to the southwest here to Wardak Province.  But even during this afternoons shura, or, or meeting with tribal elders and the governor, the generals visit was interrupted by rocket fire.  Apache helicopters scrambled in response to the fired round, and security immediately tightened."
53,The meeting gets interrupted by some rocket fire.  It gets some people nervous.
54,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  I didnt see anybody in there nervous.  Theyre all former mujahideen.  As he said, that was the celebratory fire aspect of the ceremony. But clearly, this is what this is about.  Its about pushing the security bubble out.  Its about rooting out every last guy, so that theres not even somebody who can fire a single, solitary RPG round from some little qalat out here."
55,"MR. GREGORY:  The fight in Afghanistan is village to village, and it still faces tough odds.  Even a Friday morning run with some staff and young soldiers provides little relief.  There is no hiding from the pressure of rescuing Americas longest-running war."
56,"Up next, much more from Kabul, including my exclusive sit-down conversation with General Petraeus when we return."
57,(Announcements)
58,MR. GREGORY:  My exclusive conversation with General David Petraeus about the future of the war here in Afghanistan when a special edition of MEET THE PRESS continues.
59,(Announcements)
60,"MR. GREGORY:  We are back in Kabul for this special edition of MEET THE PRESS.  On Friday morning, I sat down for a more in-depth conversation with General David Petraeus at the headquarters of U.S. and coalition forces here in Kabul, in the very room where General Petraeus gets a daily briefing on the progress of the war."
61,"General, thank you for having us in the situational awareness room.  Its good to be here."
62,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, its good to have you in Afghanistan, David."
63,"MR. GREGORY:  This is a very difficult time in this war, and, and we have talked about your assessment of winning vs.  losing.  The reality that you understand is that the American public is not behind this war.  Our new poll with The Wall Street Journal indicates that 7 in 10 Americans lack confidence in a successful outcome to this war.  And yet your position was that were actually winning because were making some progress.  What is it that the American public is missing?"
64,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, I think its incumbent on us to show greater progress, to show sustained progress.  I would argue that the progress, if you will, really just began this spring.  Late spring was when we started to see that the operations in central Helmand Province truly were starting to improve security for the people, an up and down process, to be sure.  Taliban fighting back very hard as we took away very important sanctuaries from, from him.  And now you can see it expanding over into Kandahar Provinceagain, another tough fightand in other areas around the country, in southern Herat Province, out in the northwest, up in the north.  Again, all of these, though, are small pockets of progress."
65,"MR. GREGORY:  But cant you understand, the American people for nine years have been hearing about incremental progress in Afghanistan and remain confused, frustrated and not invested?"
66,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  I can understand it.  In fact, thats why, though, Ive sought to explain that, over the last 18 months or so, what weve sought to do in Afghanistan is get the inputs right for the first time.  When a lot of us came out of Iraq in late 2008 and started looking intently at Afghanistan, we realized that we did not have the organizations that are required for the conduct of a comprehensive civil/military counterinsurgency campaign, that in some cases we needed individuals in charge of those organizations that we didnt have.  We needed to refine the concepts to build, in some cases, concepts that didnt exist; for example, reintegration.  If you dont want to have to kill or capture every bad guy in the country, you have to reintegrate those who are willing to be reconciled and become part of the solution instead of a continued part of the problem.  And then, above all, the resources.  And by the end of August, of course, we will have nearly tripled the number of U.S. forces on the ground, well have expanded the non-U.S. NATO forces, tripled the number of civilians, increased the funding to enable 100,000 more Afghan national security forces, and so on.  And, indeed, that is enabling alreadythe inputs already are enabling some outputs.  And, of course, what weve got to show is that thethese additional inputs can allow greater progress, and that thats progress that can be sustained over time by Afghan forces and Afghan officials."
67,"MR. GREGORY:  But even getting the inputs right, can you prevail in this war if you do not have the backing of the American people?"
68,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, again, this is why it is incumbent on us to show allits not just American people, its the citizens of all 47 or so troop-contributing nations, and of other nations who are contributing money and not forces.  They have to have a sense that, again, we can achieve the very important objectives we have here.  Lets remember why we are here. Were here so that Afghanistan does not once again become a sanctuary for transnational extremists the way it was when al-Qaeda planned the 9/11 attacks in the Kandahar area, conducted the initial training for the attackers in training camps in Afghanistan before they moved on to Germany and then to U.S. flight schools.  And, of course, other attacks have, have emanated from here or the region because, of course, its a regional issue as well."
69,"MR. GREGORY:  You talk a lot about unity of effort, but the national security team, under this administration, has not had that.  And I wonder what you think the impact is, the residual impact is, of General McChrystal being fired because his speaking publicly aired some real differences within the national security team which undermine the effort."
70,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, first of all, let me just start in Afghanistan and state very clearly that there is very good civil/military unity of effort. Ambassador Eikenberry, my U.S. diplomatic wingman, if you will, Ambassador Mark Sedwell, the NATO senior civilian representative, we are like this.  In fact, we have done numerous meetings with President Karzai together when there have been particularly important issues at hand.  And for what its worth, my sense is, from dealing with the national security team, that since President Obama made this decision, that everyone has linked arms and is moving forward together."
71,"MR. GREGORY:  Theres another developing story that the militarys very unhappy about, and that is the leaking of secret war documents that were put on the Internet by WikiLeaks.  Theres another 15,000 documents that are coming out.  Whats in those documents?  How damaging will they be?"
72,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, first of all, this is beyond unfortunate.  I mean, this is a betrayal of trust.  I mean, someone who had apparently had access to highly classified material, albeit not top secret, I dont believe, and not the code word and so forth.  And, in fact, a lot of this, when we first looked at it, we saw it as what we call first reports.  Its, its undigested.  Its not the final analysis.  However, as we have looked through it more and more, there are, there are source names and, in some cases, there are actual names of individuals with whom we have partnered in difficult missions in difficult places; and, obviously, that is very reprehensible.  Im not sure whats in those other 15,000 or, or whatever it is, and well have to see what that is when it comes out."
73,"MR. GREGORY:  There, theres some talk that it could be worse than the previous batch.  Can you add to that?"
74,GEN. PETRAEUS:  I cant.  No.  No.  No.  Ituntil we see what it is and evaluate it as we have now been able to do with these previous materials released.
75,"MR. GREGORY:  Youre a unique, a unique figure in this situation. Conventional wisdom about a war that is effectively lost, without public support, with corruption and lack of confidence in a host government, sounds like the dark days of Iraq when you came to lead the surge.  Is it comparable?"
76,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, its different.  It is comparable in some ways.  You know, theres a reasonably heavy rucksack of responsibility that goes with a position like this.  There is a host of great individuals out thereour soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and civilians, who all shoulder this rucksack as a team of teams, and then, of course, all of our international partners, and, of course, our Afghan counterparts as well.  And lets not forget the enormous sacrifice that our Afghan partners are making, because the Afghan army, the Afghan police, are taking much higher casualties than our forces are."
77,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me talk about U.S. troops.  I asked you before, when we talked about this July deadline of next year, how stifling is the, the concept of this deadline and this Washington debate to what youre trying to do here?"
78,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  I dont find it that stifling.  Im not bowed over by, you know, the knowledge that July 2011 is out there.  In fact, the president has been very clear, Vice President Bidens been very clear as well, more recently, that this is a date when a process begins that is conditions based. And as the conditions permit, we transition tasks to our Afghan counterparts and to security forces and, and in various governmental institutions, and that enables a responsible drawdown of our forces..."
79,MR. GREGORY:  Let me just stop you.
80,GEN. PETRAEUS:  ...of the service forces to begin.
81,"MR. GREGORY:  I just want to clarify this.  Didcould you reach that point and say, I know that the process is supposed to begin, but my assessment as the commander here is that it cannot begin now?"
82,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Certainly, yeah.  Again, the president and I sat down in the Oval Office, and he expressed very clearly that what he wants from me is my best professional military advice where I understand the mission thats been assigned, we have recommended the strategy and the resources that are required for that strategy, and as there are changes in any of that, that, obviously, I would communicate that to him, recognizing that he has some issues with which he has to deal that we dont have to worry about.  But that, thats real life. And, again, that was the process that we worked through last fall, a process that I thought was very good, the outcome of which was something that we, we strongly supported."
83,"Let me point out one other item about July 2011 if I could.  Because what I have often noted was that in the speech that the president made at West Point, there were two messages.  One was a message of substantial additional commitment, additional 30,000 troops, again more civilians, more funding for Afghan forces, authorization of 100,000 more of them and so forth; but also a message of increased urgency.  And thats what July 2011 really connotes.  It is to all the participants, those in Kabul, some of us in uniform, again our civilian counterparts, that weve got to get on with this, that this has been going on for some nine years or so, that there is understandable concern, in some cases frustration, and that, therefore, weve got to really put our shoulder to the wheel and show during the course of this year that progress can be achieved.  And, and, again, one manifestation of that is out there that you have this date.  But, again, weve had good dialogue on this, and I think the presidents been quite clear in explaining that its a process, not an event, and that its conditions based."
84,"MR. GREGORY:  Theres a feeling that General Petraeus, with the credibility you have, will be in a position to prevail in a debate about this and say to the president, Look, you know, you put me in this position to do a tough job, now youve got to listen to me.  I need what I need at the time that I need it."
85,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Look, my job is, again, to provide my best professional military advice, informed, certainly, by an awareness of the context within which I provide it, but not driven by it.  And thats the same way that we approached the very difficult recommendations that we made during the effort in Iraq.  Over time I think those worked out and, touch wood, that over time they can work out here as well."
86,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me talk to you about the Afghan government.  Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan, is he a friend, a foe, or something in between?"
87,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, I think he is the president of a sovereign country, and we have to understand that.  In many cases, most cases, we have converging objectives, as is the case in any of these situations, but in some cases we see things a little bit differently.  And thats natural.  We went through this with Prime Minister Maliki on numerous occasions.  Weve gone through this in, in virtually every contingency operation which Ive been engaged. Theres a situation which the security forces from outside and the government officials of that particular country occasionally see things or come at things a little bit differently.  And weve had those moments, and well continue to have them.  When folks ask, you know, Hows the relationship? I say its a good relationship because, in fact, we can have those kinds of discussions."
88,MR. GREGORY:  How often do you discuss things with them?
89,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, weI have literally talked to the president on average about once a day.  There have been a couple times where weve had multiple meetings on a given day.  Every now and then well go a day without talking. But we have had numerous conversations, and a couple of those have been at his residence, even, you know, walking in his garden out behind his house and so forth.  And again, we have athe kind of relationship that I believe we can each be forthright with the other, and that means occasionally, again, confronting issues that are difficult for either of us."
90,MR. GREGORY:  But is he a real partner of the United States?
91,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, I think he is.  And beyond that, he is the sovereign president of his country.  So..."
92,"MR. GREGORY:  But that may be the case, and disagreements are one thing, but the reality is that if his government is rife with corruption, corruption is fueling the insurgency and basically fueling the enemies that were fighting."
93,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  And I think hes been quite forthright about recognizing that.  He has stated repeatedly, most recently, of course, just a couple weeks ago in the Kabul conference, very publicly and openly, about the various activities that need to, to take place to combat the kinds of corruption and other activities, some predatory practices, if you will, of local governance and so forth, so that, that indeed you have to get rid of this to achieve legitimacy in the eyes of the people of the Afghan government.  Hes aware of that.  If you look at the number of individuals who have been either fired or arrested and tried for corruption, it is a very growing list, and there are some others that are pending as well."
94,"MR. GREGORY:  But real red flags have been raised by his interference with this anti-corruption task force.  Theres not a resolution to this yet, but is this something that youre watching very closely?"
95,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Oh, it is, certainly.  And, and, and he knows that.  Weve talked to him about that.  Again, he had some issues about the legal basis, sovereign, sovereignty and so forth and the Western involvement with it.  Some of those understandable, but very clearly we have to watch this.  And, and again, thatsthat is exactly what is going on."
96,"MR. GREGORY:  This may sound unrealistic, but isnt it fair to ask, is, is there a statute of limitations on this guy?  Is there a cutoff point for him where he either is with the program, with us or against us?"
97,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, I mean, hes been elected for a term of office, and he will be the president during that term of office."
98,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but, but sponsored by us.  I mean, without us, he cant stay alive, can he?"
99,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, and the international community writ large.  And, again, certainly the international community has every right, if you will, to engage with him on these kinds of issues, and thats whatexactly whats going on."
100,"MR. GREGORY:  But is there, is there a cutoff point for him in your mind?"
101,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Oh, no.  I mean, again, this is a process.  Again, this is a, a case in which each side has concerns and has, I mean, there are different pressures on all of the partners involved in this, not just the U.S. and Afghan partners, but the other international partners, our other diplomatic colleagues and so forth, and, and all of that then gets dealt with."
102,"MR. GREGORY:  Heres a small example of the problem.  If we look at this map and down at the bottom is Kandahar province, which is where the big campaign is expected to be in the fall, and The Washington Post wrote this about the Kandaharis, an historically tough lot in terms of resistance to outsiders. Many Kandaharis regard the Taliban, the insurgents,  as wayward brothers and cousins - fellow Pashtuns with whom they can negotiate and one day reconcile.  They also worry about siding with their government because they fear Taliban retribution, both now and when U.S. troop reductions begin next summer. Isnt that an example of the problem you face?"
103,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, there are numerous challenges, and those are among them.  And let me just highlight what they, they say.  First of all, the rank and file of the insurgency is, indeed, local Afghans.  It is Pashtun brothers. It is largely a Pashtun insurgency.  There are some other ethnic groups involved in it, certainly, and some transnational elements as well, but essentially it is a Pashtun insurgency.  And the $5-a-day Taliban are certainly candidates for reintegration into Afghan society.  And that is actually starting to happen a bit more over time, and were still awaiting the fairly imminent announcement, we think, of the actual reintegration and reconciliation policy.  So, again, we think that is going to move forward, and thats what you want to have happen.  Now, what it also highlights is the intimidation that the Taliban has been able to carry out, and thats a factor of us having to provide better security."
104,"MR. GREGORY:  But isnt the bottom line that if the Afghan people trusted their own government, they would defeat the Taliban on their own?  And the, the fact is they dont yet trust their government."
105,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, a governments first responsibility, of course, is to secure its people so that those people can indeed declare their allegiance, if you will.  And if the government has not been able to secure the population in an area, particularly in a country that has been at war for some 30 years and where the people have, in some cases, been professional chameleons, you know, they, they end up siding with whowhichever side it appears is going to prevail.  Thats how you survive.  And so, again, our first and most important task with our Afghan security force partners has to be to improve the security for the people so that they literally can cast a vote, not just in the elections in September for their parliamentary leadership, but literally cast a vote for or against the Afghan government, a government that does have to earn legitimacy, in their eyes, through its actions."
106,"MR. GREGORY:  But you, evenI mean theres a lot of things that have to be done, and you talk about getting the big ideas right.  And yet, it seems like one of the biggest ideas that you have yet to surmount is the fact that there are Afghans sitting on the fence because they dont trust the government, theytheres no love lost for the Taliban, but at least perhaps they can turn to them, or they fear retribution, and everybody in the region is now aware that the days of U.S. troops being here actively securing the country are numbered.  And everybodys, you know, is making moves based on that information."
107,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, first, Id caution those in the region not to jump to conclusions.  I think that we will have an enduring commitment here in some fashion, the character of which may change over time as our Afghan partners can do more and were able to do less in certain areas, certainly.  And then youre right that there are some on the fence.  Theres no question about that.  Again, they are professional survivors.  When the Afghan government shows that it can secure them and see to their basic needs, among which are conflict resolution, local conflict resolutionland disputes, petty crime, and so forthand if the government cant do that or wont do it or doesnt do it properly, thats when the Taliban can appear to be an alternative.  And thats, thats reality, and werewe and our Afghan partners are aware of that.  Its one reason that we are supporting the civilian effort to enhance rule of law and so forth in a much more significant way than we have in the past."
108,"MR. GREGORY:  On this big point, how do you respond to critics who say, Look, General, you have got to redefine your nation-building goals for Afghanistan.  It is simply too much to accomplish dealing with a population thats too resistant to outsiders.  We cantwe cannot succeed at that?"
109,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  At the end of the day, its not about their embrace of us, its not about us winning hearts and minds, its about the Afghan government winning hearts and minds.  This isnt to say that there is any kind of objective of turning Afghanistan into Switzerland in three to five years or less.  Afghan good enough is good enough, and that means having traditional social organizing structures as part of the ultimate solution, if you will, where tribal shura councils and so forthwhich are quite democratic, by the waythey then connect at the district or province level with what goes up to Kabul and, and, and comes out as well."
110,"MR. GREGORY:  Afghanistan good enough, then, does that entail redefining, defining down some of the goals for rebuilding the nation?"
111,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  I think some of that was done last year, actually, during the course of the process that, that President Obama and the new administration led.  I think there was a refinement of objectives, a recognition of the realities on the ground and that we need beto be measured in what it is that we can actually achieve, and thats why we camethats where this concept, again, of not trying to turn Afghanistan into a Western industrialized democracy..."
112,"MR. GREGORY:  If itsif, if..."
113,GEN. PETRAEUS:  ...in five to 10 years.
114,"MR. GREGORY:  If the outcome is like Iraq, is that achieving the mission?"
115,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, the outcome in Iraq is still to be written, but if you could reduce the level of violence by some 90 to 95 percent, as was the case in Iraq, to below a threshold which allows commerce and business and outside investment to take place, where there is an election thats certainly at least elected representatives, and now you have to see if they can come together and form a government that is still representative of and responsive to the people, as was the previous one.  If that can all be achieved there, that would be a reasonable solution here as well."
116,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to ask you about the enemy here.  And, and, if you would, we have a pointer here, would you point out on the map where the sanctuaries in Pakistan are that are the biggest threat to U.S. forces, because the Taliban can operate out of those sanctuaries, cross the border and fight, and then run back into Pakistan?"
117,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, first let me just point out, of course, that what we face is not some kind of monolithic Taliban enemy.  In fact, its more like a syndicate is the term that we often use for the enemy that, that faces our troopers and our Afghan counterparts and the Afghan civilians.  But what we face generally, of course, is, again, in the southern part of the country, this is the Taliban, the Afghan Taliban.  And then as you work your way up into the eastern part, you start to get the Haqqani network linked to the Taliban, again has a symbiotic relationship with them, but is not subservient one to the other.  And then you do, in fact, have some small elements of al-Qaeda, you have the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan, you have some Pakistani Taliban and, and other elements that come into the country.  Now this, of course, is the federally administered tribal area, up here is Swat valley, these are the areas where Pakistan has fought so hard and taken such significant casualties over the last 18 months.  But there are areas that they have not yet dealt with, and north Waziristan is certainly one of those.  They have had operations in south Waziristan.  And then there are some of the other agencies.  There is a portion of western Khyber Agency that they, they know."
118,"Let me point out one other, one other point, if I could.  What is interesting is that the Taliban leads from the rear, as we would say.  The Taliban leads from Pakistan.  And by the way, the rank and file is just catching on to this. We actually see discussions among them chatter among them, conversation wondering where their senior leaders are and wondering why Mullah Omar hasnt set foot back in Afghanistan or even been heard from now in, in months and months and months.  But the senior leaders dont come in and share hardship and risk with their troopers on the ground, they send messages.  They do it by cell phone or what have you, and that is actually going to be a problem for them, as, as is what we have pointed out with our Afghan partners, much more in recent weeks, and that is what the Taliban have been doing despite their supposed counterinsurgency guidance of being nice to the people and so forth. And they are much more responsible for civilian casualties than are our forces and our Afghan forces.  Most recently they were distinguished by flogging and then assassinating a pregnant woman.  They have used children and teenagers to carry out attacks.  They have dressed in burqas.  Again, what they have done is really quite egregious, particularly in the context of the religion and in the context of, of the normal codes of conduct."
119,"MR. GREGORY:  But let me ask you, then, what is the biggest threat if there are very few al-Qaeda that are actually operating in Afghanistan today?  You have outlined the, the sanctuary difficulty that you face that is in Pakistan, and this is a country that the United States pays billions of dollars to, and yet some of that money is going to aid and abet insurgents and terrorists who are killing our troopers."
120,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, I, I dont know that I would buy that yet.  I mean, our money goes to the, on the security side, to the Pakistan army, and the economic assistance goes to various elements of society and to the Pakistani government directly.  And, again, first, remember what Pakistan has done over the course of the last 18 months.  Remember the casualties they have sustained in taking on the extremists in their country, albeit focusing on those who are most threatening the very existence of Pakistan as its citizens know it, and then recognizing that theres no question about the sanctuaries or about the need to do more work in those particular sanctuaries."
121,MR. GREGORY:  Could Pakistan deliver Osama bin Laden today?
122,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, I dont think anyone knows where Osama bin Laden is, and the fact that it took him four weeks to get a congratulatory message out, or a message of condolence in, say, in the course of the last year or so, when weve seen these, indicates, literally, how far buried he is, probably, in the very, very most remote and mountainous regions."
123,MR. GREGORY:  Is his capture less important today than it was?
124,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, I think he remains an iconic figure, and I think capturing or killing Osama bin Laden is still a very, very important task for all of those who are engaged in counterterrorism around the world."
125,"MR. GREGORY:  If the Taliban comes back into government in Afghanistan in any form, do you automatically believe that al-Qaeda comes back?"
126,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, you know, this isthese are the kinds of questions that people talk about when they talk about reconciliation, and that is, of course, with the more senior leaders of the Taliban and, and other elements. And I think there is a prospect for reconciliation with some of the groups.  I didnt mention the HIG, another element thats out there that has made a number of overtures and, and reportedly is entertaining thoughts of agreeing to the red lines that President Karzai has put downaccepting the constitution, laying down weapons, renouncing al-Qaeda, being a productive element in society.  The way these kinds of endeavors typically end, as with the case in Iraqyou know, ultimately we had to face the question in Iraq of will we sit down across the table from people who have our blood on their hands?  And the answer was yes.  That was a decision that I had to make early on in the surge.  It doesnt mean that Mullah Omar is about to stroll down Main Street in Kabul anytime soon and, and raise his hand and swear an oath on the constitution of Afghanistan.  But every possibility, I think, that there can be low and midlevel reintegration and, indeed, some fracturing of the senior leadership that could be really defined as reconciliation."
127,"MR. GREGORY:  Did you see that cover of Time magazine in the last couple of weeks, an example of the brutality of the Taliban, with a woman whose nose was cut off of her face, a reminder of what Taliban rule was.  How often do you think about that as there is the prospect of the Taliban returning, reconciling in some way, becoming a part of this countrys future?"
128,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, we think about it all the time.  And again, we think about it in the human context, which that photograph so visibly represented and horrifically represented.  We also think about it when it comes to our core objective.  The fact is that it was the Taliban that allowed al-Qaeda to establish its bases and sanctuaries in Afghanistan when it controlled a good bit of the country.  And that gives big pause, needless to say, and that is why, again, this insurgency has to be combated."
129,"MR. GREGORY:  The bottom line question that Ive been thinking about asking you is, if we win in Afghanistan, what do we win; and if we lose, what do we lose?"
130,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, the, the latter is almost easier because, if you lose, it has, I think, some significant repercussions, not just for this country, although they would be enormous, and start with the cover of Time magazine for starters.  Then think about our security interests, and then think about the region and what it could do to the region if, in fact, extremists were able to take over all or part of this country again after what presumably would be a very bloody civil war in which different countries in the region would take sides.  And, again, the prospect is, I think, is pretty frightening."
131,"If we succeed, on the other hand, obviously we, we are, again, succeeding in a region that has implications and links to security issues throughout the world.  If Afghanistan can become the central Asian roundabout, to use President Karzais term, to where it can be the new Silk Road, think of the implications for that, recalling that, of course, Afghanistan is blessed with the presence of what are trillions, with an S on the end, trillions of dollars worth of minerals if, and only if, you can get the extractive technology, the human capital operated, the lines of communication to enable you to get it out of the country and all the rest of that.  Very big if. And of course, theres a foundation of security that would be necessary on, on which to build all of that.  But, again, the prospects are very significant if you can achieve objectives."
132,"And, and, by the way, Im always leery of using terms, actually, like winning because it seems to imply that, you know, you just find the right hill out there somewhere, you take it, you plant the flag, and you go home to a victory parade.  I dont think thats going to be the case here.  I think this is going toand Ive said this repeatedly when I was a Central Command commander, even before that, that this was going to require a substantial, significant commitment and, and that it is going to have to be enduring to some degree, again, albeit its character and its size being scaled down over the years."
133,"MR. GREGORY:  You said five years ago, the longest campaign of the long war."
134,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, I did.  As I mentioned to you, I met with Secretary Rumsfeld after conducting an assessment for him after leaving Iraq after a second tour there where wed stood up the train and equip mission.  And he asked that we use what wed learned there to evaluate what was going on here. And we went all around the country, did a reasonably good assessment, went back and met with Secretary Rumsfeld and laid out a variety of areas in which actions could be taken that could, based on what wed learned in Iraq, where they could be improvements to what was going on in Afghanistan.  Ive talked about some areas that also just needed to be sustained as well, and then added that my sense of the situation was that, given the 30 years of war, given the, the lack of human capital because of all that fighting, given the fact that, even before that 30 years of war began, Afghanistan was one of the five poorest countries in the world, that my sense was that this would likely be the longest campaign in what we then called the long war."
135,MR. GREGORY:  A couple of additional questions.  Id like to ask you about Iraq again.  Do you consider this a durable success?
136,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, again, I think the final chapter for Iraq is certainly still to be written.  And of course, theres an immediate, pressing issue there, which is the formation of the government.  I think they can come together.  I think that what will end up happening is it wont be a question of just who will be the president, prime minister, and speaker of the council of representatives; rather, there will be some power sharing agreements that will be officially or unofficially made that will enable the selection of the key leaders.  I think that is what is holding the process up.  Very important, of course, to get that government in place and, and, and hopefully to ensure that it is like the previous government.  For all its challenges, it was representative of the Iraqi people, and it was broadly responsive to it.  They knew there were elections coming up, and they actually took actions because of that."
137,"MR. GREGORY:  As history marches forward, do you think President Bush will get more credit for the Iraq war?"
138,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, I think he certainly made a very courageous decision in, in ordering the surge and deciding on that.  That obviously was not the most popular move at the time, having been in the center of that, and it was a very tough call.  And we went through a number of very difficult months, as youll recall, because the level of violence went up quite considerably as the surge forces arrived and as they went into offensive operations to take away the sanctuaries from the enemy that the al-Qaeda in Iraq had enjoyed for a couple of years in some cases.  Its not unlike a bit of what is playing out here, albeit on not quite the same scale throughout the country because, again, the situation here is quite different."
139,"MR. GREGORY:  When it comes to Iran and its effect in this country, are you now considering active talks with Iran as it applies to the future of Afghanistan?"
140,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, I, I am certainly not, and obviously that would be a huge policy decision.  But the fact is that President Karzai has had discussions with Iran.  There, there are areas of convergence, actually.  This is aana country in which there are actually some common objectives if Iran can look past its desire that we not succeed too easily.  The fact is that Iran doesnt want to see the Taliban come back any more than do most Afghan citizens.  Its, itsagain, its an ultra-conservative, extremist Sunni-Islamic organization, and they dont want to see it rule in the country again the way it did in the past.  Having said that, they also dont want to see us achieve our objectives easily, and they have, indeed, provided over time what mightone might call modest amounts of weapons, explosives, and funding and some training to the Taliban as well."
141,"MR. GREGORY:  Whats worse, Iran with a nuclear weapon or the fallout of an attack on Iran to prevent a nuclear weapon?"
142,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Thats, thats one for the policymakers.  And of course, thats the huge question that looms out there.  And, obviously, when I was a Central Command commander, you know, we had a variety of different input and made a variety of different, you know, plans and so forth.  You know, what the military gets paid to do is, indeed, to think about what-ifs and then, indeed, to prepare for them."
143,MR. GREGORY:  I want to get a sense of your frame of mind while youre here. What are you reading?
144,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  I just read a book about Kipling in India, of all things. And most recently Ive been reading about the historiography of Grant, how historians changed their views of Grant over the years, initially, of course, regarding him as the true hero, of course.  And then, over time, in the 1900s, there was a period when a bit more disparaging views of him, and then its actually come up again in recent years."
145,"MR. GREGORY:  Funny you should say that because I had this quote prepared for you by someaboutfrom someone that you admire.  It is this, I am not a politician, never was.  I hope never to be. Do you know who said that?"
146,GEN. PETRAEUS:  Was it Grant?
147,MR. GREGORY:  It was Grant.
148,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, I am not a politician, and I will never be, and I say that with absolute conviction."
149,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, thats what he said.  But does that mean that youre totally clear youd never run for president?"
150,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Yeah, I really am.  And, you know, Ive said that Ill adopt what Sherman said and go back and look at what has come to be known as a Shermanesque answer on that particular question."
151,"MR. GREGORY:  No way, no how."
152,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  No way, no how."
153,"MR. GREGORY:  Good luck, General, and God bless our troops.  Thank you."
154,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Thanks.  Great to have you with us again, David."
155,"MR. GREGORY:  You could see more of our exclusive conversation with General Petraeus in our Take Two Web extra.  Its up on our website right now, mtp.msnbc.com."
156,"And when we come back, some closing thoughts from me on this trip to Afghanistan, after these brief messages."
157,(Announcements)
158,"MR. GREGORY:  Finally, a few takeaways from my trip here to Afghanistan.  The deeper you go into this story, through reporting and through studying the history of this country, the more you feel the weight of just how difficult and confusing this place is.  It gives you a very uncertain outlook for the future here.  Americas history in the region is long, but its also shortsighted.  And even as America has a more robust commitment to the war now, I sense a, a certain weariness and even doubt about whats ultimately possible here, with deep debates about whether nation building can work and whether the conflict will end in anything other than stalemate."
159,"General Petraeus is a military leader with great commitment and great intellectual rigor, but you have to wonder whether he has enough time politically to achieve what he thinks is possible here."
160,"President Bush told people before leaving office, privately, that succeeding here in Afghanistan would be vastly more difficult than even Iraq, and here we are still fighting in what General Petraeus himself said five years ago would be the longest campaign in the long war.  The question now for the American public is whether it has the stomach and the will to do what it takes to succeed here, and whether it has the stomach for what could happen here if the U.S. and its allies fail."
161,"From Afghanistan, thats all for today.  Ill be back next week from Washington.  If its Sunday, its MEET THE PRESS."

7,"MR. GREGORY:  The referendum on President Obama and the Democrats takes center stage as races heat up across the country.  We discuss the issues that may affect how you vote in November--the economy, jobs, the deficit, the war in Afghanistan, and the withdrawal of troops from Iraq.  With us, our top newsmaker interview this morning, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the GOP leader of the Senate."
8,"Then, a debate on the influence of the tea party on national politics with former House Majority Leader and author of the new book about the movement ""Give Us Liberty,"" Republican Dick Armey; and Michigan's Democratic governor, Jennifer Granholm."
9,"Finally, our political roundtable on the fight over that Islamic cultural center and mosque near Ground Zero, the growing controversy, American views about Islam, and uncertainty about President Obama's own religious beliefs. With us, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic magazine; Paul Gigot, editorial page editor of The Wall Street Journal; Katty Kay of the BBC; and former Congressman Rick Lazio, Republican candidate for governor in New York."
10,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
11,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
12,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  The president and his family are on day four of their 10-day vacation.  But before leaving for Martha's Vineyard, the president criss-crossed the country in campaign mode, making the case for Democratic candidates in some tough races this November.  Here with us now, the man hoping to become the new majority leader in the Senate, the current
minority leader, the leader of the Republicans, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky."
13,"Leader McConnell, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS."
14,SEN. MITCH McCONNELL (R-KY):  Good morning. 
15,"MR. GREGORY:  We will talk politics, but I also want to talk about the controversy surrounding plans to build a mosque and a community center in Lower Manhattan near the site of Ground Zero.  Here is Time magazine, out on newsstands now, with the cover, ""Is America  Islamophobic?  What the anti-mosque uproar tells us about how the U.S. regards Muslims."" We know it is their right to build a community center and a mosque near Ground Zero.  My question for you is, is it the wise thing to do?"
16,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, obviously this is not about freedom of religion in America.  Typically, these kinds of decisions are made by local officials. What's been different about this one is you have the president of the United States weighing in on this issue on--actually on each side
of the issue within 24 hours, which has helped stimulate a great national debate, not about freedom of religion, about--but about the appropriateness of the location."
17,MR. GREGORY:  What is your view about whether it should be built?
18,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, ultimately that's going to be decided by the people of New York.  But I think we--because of the, the nature of the attack on 9/11, a lot of people, not just in New York, but around the country, have strong views about this.  And I hope the people of New York who can actually make the decision will take into account public opinion, not only locally, but around the country, in making a final decision on the location of this facility. "
19,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, that would suggest you think it should be moved, because public opinion is squarely against it."
20,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, I would suggest that, what I said a minute ago, the local officials, in the end, are going to make this decision.  It's a symbol to a lot of Americans because of the 9/11 attack.  Governor Paterson, I note, is weighing in and trying to work something out.  I
hope they'll weigh public opinion in the United States in making a final decision about the location of this center."
21,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think the president appropriately stepped in to this debate?  Was that leadership?
22,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, it certainly made it a much bigger issue.  It was already a developing issue, but it made it a much bigger issue when the president of the United States decides to weigh in on a local, basically, zoning decision made--or site selection decision made by local officials in most communities in America."
23,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator, this is about more than a local zoning decision. I mean, President Bush went out of his way after 9/11 to talk about the way the West, the way America should relate to the, the Muslim world.  This is about the wounds of 9/11; it's not simply about a
development project.  Don't you think it requires Republican leaders like yourself to be the faces of leadership on this, and not the likes of Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin?"
24,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Look, I mean, the president's been ignoring public opinion all year long on a variety of things.  People were not in favor of the stimulus bill, they were not in favor of the healthcare bill, they're certainly not in favor of the spending, the debt, the Washington
takeovers, and they're not in favor of the tax increases that they have in mind in September.  I think one of the reasons the president's approval rating is so low now is that he doesn't pay a whole lot of attention to public opinion."
25,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me move on to something that seems to be related to this and has gotten a lot of attention this week, and this is the poll about the president's own faith from the Pew Research Center.  Eighteen percent of those polled believe that the president is a Muslim.  Among Republicans, this is striking, 31 percent believe he's a Muslim.  Of course, he's not.  Why do you think these views prevail? "
26,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, look, I think the faith that most Americans are questioning is the president's faith in the government to generate jobs. We've had an 18-month effort here on the part of this administration to prime the pump, borrow money, spend money hiring new federal government employees, sending money down to states so they don't have to lay off state employees. People are looking around and saying, ""Where's the job?"""
27,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
28,SEN. McCONNELL:  The president's faith in the government to stimulate the economy is what people are questioning.
29,"MR. GREGORY:  That, that, that's certainly a side step to, to this particular question.  Again..."
30,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, no, I--the--I--the president..."
31,"MR. GREGORY:  ...as a leader of the country, sir, as one of the most powerful Republicans in the country, do you think you have an obligation to say to 34 percent of Republicans in the country--rather, 31 percent, who believe the president of the United States is a Muslim?  That's misinformation."
32,"SEN. McCONNELL:  The president says he's a--the president says he's a Christian, I take him at his word.  I don't think that's in dispute. "
33,"MR. GREGORY:  And do you think--how, how do you think it comes to be that this kind of misinformation gets spread around and prevails?"
34,"SEN. McCONNELL:  I have no idea, but I take the president at his word."
35,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's move on to some domestic matters.  Here was the headline in a Washington Post editorial on Friday with regard to policy issues:  ""With the tax vote, Republicans fail in their attempt to appear fiscally responsible."" You and other Republicans would like to see the Bush-era tax cuts extended.  The president, of course, wants to repeal
them except for those on the wealthiest Americans; in other words, those taxes would go up. What are you prepared to do to pay for an extension of tax cuts for everybody?"
36,"SEN. McCONNELL:  This has been tax law in, in America for almost 10 years now, existing tax law.  What the administration is proposing, and the majorities in the House and Senate, is to raise taxes on the top 2 brackets, which will affect 50 percent of small business income and
in--and impact 25 percent of the work force.  For example, if you look at last--the last quarter of last year, 84 percent of the jobs that were lost were lost in small business.  I think it is outrageous to suggest that raising taxes in the middle of a recession is a good idea."
37,"MR. GREGORY:  Point taken.  But, Senator, my question is... "
38,SEN. McCONNELL:  If they want to have--if they want to have that debate...
39,"MR. GREGORY:  But my question is how do you pay for an extension of tax cuts? Because if you're concerned, as Republicans say they are, about cutting spending and the deficit, you have to acknowledge that tax cuts are not paid for."
40,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, what, what, what, what are you talking about paid for? This is existing tax policy.  It's been in place for 10 years.  What they're talking about is raising taxes, impacting 50 percent of small business income in the middle of what most Americans think is a
recession.  That is not a responsible thing to do in my judgment. "
41,"MR. GREGORY:  It still--but it's still borrowed money.  Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, on this program August 1st, said the following.  Watch this."
42,"(Videotape, August 1, 2010)"
43,"MR. ALAN GREENSPAN:  Look, I'm very much in favor of tax cuts, but not with borrowed money.  And the problem that we've gotten into in recent years is spending programs with borrowed money, tax cuts with borrowed money.  And, at the end of the day, that proves disastrous.  And my view is I don't think we can play subtle policy here."
44,MR. GREGORY:  You don't agree with Republican leaders who say tax cuts pay for themselves?
45,MR. GREENSPAN:  They do not.
46,(End videotape)
47,"MR. GREGORY:  The CBO, Senator, this week made it very clear that the long-term picture for the economy, for the deficit, is very dark if you extend the Bush-era tax cuts without somehow paying for them."
48,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Look, what we're talking about here is, is tax increases in the middle of a recession.  We are going to have the third year in a row, under this administration, of an annual deficit of more than a trillion dollars.  That is not because we are taxing too little, David, it's because we're spending too much."
49,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator, with respect..."
50,SEN. McCONNELL:  We need to freeze...
51,"MR. GREGORY:  ...you're being unresponsive to a question, which is are tax cuts paid for going forward..."
52,SEN. McCONNELL:  Well...
53,MR. GREGORY:  ...or is it borrowed money at a time when you and other Republican leaders say we must get serious about the deficit?  It's a straightforward question.
54,"SEN. McCONNELL:  I--yeah, I know.  And I, and I gave you a straightforward answer.  What we're talking about here is raising taxes in the middle of what most Americans think is a recession.  That isn't going to produce more revenue.  We've, we've got a serious job loss
problem in this country.  They have primed the pump, they've borrowed money, they've spent money for the last year and a half, unemployment is still almost at 10 percent, and now the job creators, the small businesses in this country they're suggesting they're taxes go up?  Look,
the president called in a bunch of small businessmen to the White House a few weeks ago, and he asked them why they weren't expanding. And their answer was, ""Mr. President, with all due respect, your agenda""--healthcare mandates, tax increased headed their way, more and
more burdensome regulation.  I mean, look at the new healthcare bill for example. There's a provision in there that requires that small businesses send a 1099 form to the IRS for every vender they do $600 worth of business with.  That's just a massive amount of paperwork and problems. This administration..."
55,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator..."
56,"SEN. McCONNELL:  ...is extraordinarily anti-business, and raising taxes in the middle of a recession is not the way to go."
57,"MR. GREGORY:  For a final time, I'll go back to my question, which is the extension of the tax cuts would cost two point--$3.2 trillion.  That's borrowed money that adds to the deficit.  Do you have a plan to pay for that extension?"
58,"SEN. McCONNELL:  You're talking about current tax policy.  Why did all it of a sudden become something that may ""paid for."" Look, the problem is the spending problem.  If we grind down the spending, we will begin to get a handle on this mounting debt, and if you push this economy further backward, we'll get less revenue for the government, not more.  Raising
taxes in the middle of a recession on the major job generator in America, small business, is a very, very bad idea."
59,"MR. GREGORY:  You talk about spending, and that's very interesting.  This is what, what's called ""A Roadmap for America's Future:  A Plan to Solve America's Long-Term Economic and Fiscal Crisis,"" written by the conservative congressman, Paul Ryan, of Wisconsin.  It lays out some draconian steps to balance the budget, to cut spending in both Social
Security and Medicare.  I'm wondering why it is, if Republican leaders are so serious about cutting the deficit and cutting spending, why there aren't more than 13 co-sponsors in the United States Congress for this plan?"
60,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, let me tell you what we are doing right now in the United States Senate.  The majority leader, Harry Reid, told me on the floor of the Senate a couple of weeks ago that they're going to come down to the top line that we offered for this year's appropriations bill, which is essentially a freeze over last year.  How much money will that
save?  The difference between that top line in annual spending and what the president asked for over 10 years will be $300 billion, which is not chump change."
61,"Number two, the president has appointed a deficit reduction commission. This is not going to be your typical commission.  It's going to issue a report, sit on the shelf, and gather dust.  I put three members on it, very responsible members.  John Boehner has put three members on it.  We expect them to send up a recommendation no later than December of this
year to deal with our long-term debt problem, and we do know that we have a serious long-term debt problem--unfunded liabilities related to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  I don't think we ought to make what they may be doing a political football between now and November.  We'll wait for their report; and I intend, if it's a responsible report that I
can support, encourage my members to support it.  I think the president will do the same thing.  We could, before the end of this calendar year, actually have a significant impact on our long-term debt problem."
62,"MR. GREGORY:  Why is it that you need a Democratic president's commission on cutting the deficit to figure out what it is, as Republicans, you think should be cut in federal spending?"
63,"SEN. McCONNELL:  I don't think that it ought to be a political football between now and November.  We've got a bipartisan effort here, a serious bipartisan effort supported by the president, by Leader Boehner and myself. They're going to report later this year.  We will treat that report seriously. I hope it is the kind of recommendation that we can support on a bipartisan basis."
64,"MR. GREGORY:  Finally, the political question, as you look in--to the midterm race, the issues that are heating up, we've talked about a few of them, what is your prediction for the Senate in November?  Does it remain in Democratic hands?"
65,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Look, I'm, I'm not going to make a prediction.  I will say this, if the election were tomorrow, we'd have a very good day. There are at least 12 seats in the Senate where Democrats are on defense. That's pretty unusual, because we had very bad results on our side in '06 and '08.  So we're on offense, American--the American public has taken a look at this administration.  They think it's spending too much, borrowing too much, taking over too much of the private sector, and now raising taxes on top of it.  I think we're going to have a very good day."
66,MR. GREGORY:  But you cautioned against irrational exuberance about your chances in the Senate.
67,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Yeah, I think irrational exuberance is not appropriate. There are 70 some-odd days been now and the election.  I'm optimistic. "
68,"MR. GREGORY:  The tea party debate, which we'll have here in just a moment with former Majority Leader of the House Dick Armey, is very much a factor in this race.  And the tea partiers are talking about a hostile takeover of the Republican Party.  What is their impact, do you think, in the fall?"
69,"SEN. McCONNELL:  I think it's been entirely positive.  It's an indication of, of broad public support for doing something about too much spending and too much debt.  And this--the kind of genuine popular uprising against excessive government spending, I think, has been extremely
helpful.  It's produced a lot of energy in our primaries, and I think it's going to produce victories in November."
70,"MR. GREGORY:  Leader McConnell, as always, thank you very much for being here."
71,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Thank you, David."
72,"MR. GREGORY:  And coming up next, the influence of the tea party on national politics with a little bit more depth, our exclusive debate, former House Majority Leader and early tea party supporter, Republican Dick Armey vs. Michigan's Democratic governor, Jennifer Granholm.  Plus,
the fight over plans to build that Islamic cultural center and mosque near Ground Zero.  Our round table weighs in:  The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg; The Wall Street Journal's Paul Gigot; the BBC's Katty Kay; and former Congressman Rick Lazio, only here on MEET THE PRESS."
73,(Announcements)
74,"MR. GREGORY:  The influence of the tea party and government spending on national politics, an exclusive debate coming up, right after this brief commercial break."
75,(Announcements)
76,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We're back with our exclusive debate.  Here with me now, former House majority leader and author of the new book, ""Give UsLiberty:  A Tea Party Manifesto,""  Republican Dick Armey, and the Democratic governor of the state of Michigan, Jennifer Granholm."
77,Welcome to both of you.
78,"GOV. JENNIFER GRANHOLM (D-MI):  Thank you, David."
79,"MR. GREGORY:  We are talking about the impact of the tea party, the climate for this midterm race, and what the prospects are for Republicans and Democrats, and I do want to start with, when we think about issues that voters will be thinking about, some of the larger questions that arise out of this mosque debate, about whether it should be built in Lower Manhattan.  The president did speak out about this, as Senator McConnell indicated.  This is what he said at an at Iftar dinner this week."
80,"(Videotape, August 13, 2010)"
81,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  As a citizen and as president, I believe that Muslims have the right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country. That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in Lower Manhattan in accordance
with local laws and ordinances.  This is America, and our commitment to religious freedom must be unshakable."
82,"(End videotape) MR. GREGORY:  That was last Friday.  The very next day he appeared to
hedge his views on all of this. Watch."
83,"(Videotape, August 14, 2010)"
84,"PRES. OBAMA:  I was not commenting and I will not comment on the wisdom of making a decision to put a mosque there.  I was commenting very specifically on the right that people have that dates back to our founding.  That's what our country's about.  And I think it's very
important that, you know, as difficult as some of these issues are, you know, we stay focused on who we are as a people and, and what our values are all about."
85,(End videotape)
86,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor, a lot of people felt that this was a hedge, an attempt to walk back his previous support.  Has this been an example of strong leadership by the president to wade into this issue and to make statements like that?"
87,"GOV. GRANHOLM:  Well, I think that any time somebody stands up for the Constitution, which is exactly what he did, I don't think there's any disagreement that they have the right to be able to worship and to build on private property.  I don't think anybody would disagree with that. The question is whether it is a good decision on their part, right? What's the imam saying.  Now, the imam apparently is overseas and has been overseas on a State Department mission bridge building for three weeks.  And so the question is, what is the nature of this particular imam and the sect?  It's a Sufi sect, apparently, and that's supposed to
be the most peaceful of all the--that sect is under attack by al-Qaeda. I think the question really is we need to hear from the imam, but it's a real teachable moment for American Islam, for the, for the--I actually, in anticipation of this question, David, I called, because Michigan has the largest Arab-American population outside of the Middle East.  And so I called one of our imams yesterday, and I said, ""Do you know this imam? What can you tell me about him?"" He said, ""He is the most bridge building imam in--one of the most in the country."" And that we as a nation, and he's an American, of course, ought to be holding that kind of leadership close rather than saying--brushing all Muslims with this brush that affiliates them with al-Qaeda.  They're being attacked by al-Qaeda, too. They're just as offended at--or maybe even more so, because of what the, the splashback is on all Muslims.  So I think we ought to be hearing from
them."
88,"MR. GREGORY:  Leader Armey, back in 2001, after the 9/11 attacks, you went to the floor, and you were outspoken, saying that there are Muslims around the world, Arabs who are as horrified as U.S. citizens, that we ought to treat them with equal respect and decent treatment.  In that vein, do you think it's a wise decision to have the mosque here as a sign
of living our values?"
89,"FMR. REP. DICK ARMEY (R-TX):  I believe the folks that want to build the mosque there are making an unwise decision.  But I think, when, when I look at the 18 percent of the American people that are enthusiastic about this grassroots movement, we see this as while it's an important issue. It's an issue that ought not to be distracting the president from the
critical issues of unemployment, fiscal responsibility, a nation headed for bankruptcy.  And the larger issues that affect the future of our children make this issue pale. On the question of should the president be sticking up for the Constitution, our folks say, ""Well, great, I love him
sticking up for the--we should have done that on medical--Medicare,"" where, in fact, he trashed the Constitution in the view of most of our folks.  And in terms of him being here and then there, it reflects again our fear that this president is whimsical and doesn't really quite know where he is on any subject, even the larger subjects that are driving our folks in, in the street trying to make change in America."
90,"MR. GREGORY:  Youre talking about your folks, you're talking about tea partiers around the country and the movement that you've written about.  One of the arguments that Democrats make about some of the candidates who are supported by the tea party is that they're, frankly, too extreme for the--even the mainstream of the Republican Party.  And I want to go
through some of the top races and have you respond to that."
91,REP. ARMEY:  Yeah.
92,"MR. GREGORY:  Colorado U.S. Senate race, Ken Buck, Republican nominee. He wants to eliminate the Energy and Education Departments, says separation of church and state is too strictly enforced.  To Kentucky, Rand Paul, tea party candidate in the Senate race, critical, of course, of the minimum wage law, civil rights law, supports cutting back on unemployment insurance, calls Medicare socialized medicine.  Nevada, Sharron Angle, for the Senate again, talks about no adoption for same sex couples, the U.S. should pull out of the U.N., privatize Medicare and Social Security.  And finally, in Utah in the Senate race, you've got Mike Lee.  He wants to repeal the progressive income tax, supports changing the 14th Amendment of birthright citizenship.  If this is the tea party's impact on national politics, there's certainly a lot of Democrats who say too extreme for the mainstream of the political
country."
93,"REP. ARMEY:  Well, first, first of all, each one of these candidates won a Republican primary as a Republican candidate with a variety of different stresses on different issues.  I am not going to take the Democrat Party's characterization of a Republican Party candidate's
position on any issue as the gospel truth.  I don't know if you've noticed, but politicians say insincere things; and, frankly, I don't quite listen to the Democrats on the candidates.  But the voters paid attention to the candidates and made their choice.  Now, the Democrats
are--they have a guy down in, in South Carolina who wins the primary and, and is then convicted of a felony.  They ought to concern themselves with, ""What is the quality of our candidates, and can we meet the challenge of trying to race against these candidates?"" who are going to beat their person in the, in the fall."
94,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor, is this an example of what, what they've called a mainstream political movement, some of these candidates and their views? "
95,"GOV. GRANHOLM:  Well, you know, no.  I think it's far outside the mainstream. In fact, one of the things--you just held up Paul Ryan's, you know, proposal regarding Medicare and regarding Social Security.  I think a lot of which you've jumped onto as well.  But there was a recent poll
out that said that 85 percent of Americans don't want to see Social Security cut to solve the, the deficit.  The reality is, you know, as a governor of the state that has had the toughest economic go over the past eight years, I'm just really interested in what works to create jobs,
what works.  And the proposals that are coming from these candidates are not proposals that work.  This is the laboratory of the states right here, and I can tell you what has worked.  What has worked is the government smartly intervening to save the auto industry; smartly,
strategically, surgically intervening to invest with the private sector to create, for example, the electric batteries for the vehicles; smartly intervening with the private sector to be able to do the breakthrough technologies that the private sector doesn't have the funds to be able to
do. That's what other countries are doing.  And we've got to realize that these economic models that just say, ""We've got to cut, cut, cut, cut, cut,"" you know, who's applauding most is China.  They're happy that this movement is happening..."
96,MR. GREGORY:  But there's...
97,GOV. GRANHOLM:  ...that's going to continue to cut away.
98,"MR. GREGORY:  But there's a broader debate here, and I think the governor gets to it, Leader Armey..."
99,REP. ARMEY:  Well...
100,MR. GREGORY:  ...which is the role of government...
101,REP. ARMEY:  Right.
102,MR. GREGORY:  ...is it part of the problem or part of the solution?  This is what drives the tea party movement.
103,"REP. ARMEY:  Absolutely.  And, and, and, and this mischaracterization, once again, of Paul Ryan, who's probably the most creative thinking and most courageous guy in Washington, plan on Social--all Paul Ryan is saying is let Social Security be voluntary, let Medicare be voluntary.
Why--if these are such great programs, why do you have difficulty with people being free to choose?  And I'll tell you what, Paul Ryan and I  will give every Social Security recipient in America that chooses to stay in this system a better guarantee that it will be as they know it today than the Democrat Party will..."
104,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
105,"REP. ARMEY:  ...because the Democrat Party is going to start making changes that will, in fact, deny individuals their benefits."
106,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you this, though.  We--there's certainly a separation debate to be had about how to deal with Medicare and Social Security.  But I wonder, you heard my questions to Senator McConnell, he certainly doesn't appear to be on board with what Paul Ryan is talking about. There's 13 co-sponsors to strict spending.  When you talk about a
hostile takeover of the Republican Party, are the leaders of the Republican Party today part of the problem? "
107,"REP. ARMEY:  First of all, the fact that they--he only has 13 co-sponsors is a big reason why our folks are agitated against the Republicans as well as the Democrats.  The difference between being on--a co-sponsor with Ryan and not is a thing called courage.  And we have watched American public policy dominated by Democrats that don't care and Republicans that don't, don't dare for a long time.  So we're saying to the Republican Party, you know, ""Get some courage to stand up for the things that are right for this country.  Don't stand there and, and, and hide from the issue because you're afraid of the politics.  The issue of public policy that governs the future of my children is more important than your politics, and if you can't see that, we'll replace you."""
108,"MR. GREGORY:  Go ahead, Governor."
109,"GOV. GRANHOLM:  If you care, if you care about democracy and what the everday citizen believes, and you want to empower them, and they don't want the Social Security system to be dismantled and they don't want the Medicare system to be dismantled, because you're picking and choosing, and this is a compact between generations to be able to make sure that
all of our seniors have the funds when they retire that they're not going to be homeless, so they're not going to have to go to a shelter."
110,REP. ARMEY:  Well...
111,"GOV. GRANHOLM:  I'm not kidding you.  You--the idea that, that 85..."
112,"REP. ARMEY:  No, no, you, you just crack me up.  You get it wrong again."
113,"GOV. GRANHOLM:  Well, you're cracking me up, too, man."
114,"REP. ARMEY:  Now, there's nobody that's talking about dismantling these systems."
115,"GOV. GRANHOLM:  Eighty-five percent of people--well, but if you do that, every actuarial who's looked at it says that you effectively dismantle the system."
116,"REP. ARMEY:  OK, let me..."
117,GOV. GRANHOLM:  And if 85 percent of Americans wanted it...
118,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
119,"REP. ARMEY:  Let, let me ask you a simple question.  If you happen to be a Christian Scientist and have never seen a doctor in your life and never intend to go to a doctor in your life and never bought insurance in your life, is it right to, to be told at the age of 65 if you don't buy--sign up for Medicare, we'll take away your Social Security?  That's not in the law.  It's not even a regulation."
120,GOV. GRANHOLM:  Well...
121,MR. GREGORY:  I want...
122,REP. ARMEY:  It's some whimsical thing that is enforced by this government in the aftermath of policy.
123,MR. GREGORY:  I want to get one other question in.
124,"REP. ARMEY:  That is not, that is--I mean, that--you can certainly afford to give that little provision up, can't you?"
125,GOV. GRANHOLM:  No.  No.
126,"REP. ARMEY:  And let the, let the Christian Scientists be free to choose..."
127,GOV. GRANHOLM:  Let's go at it.  But I know we want...(unintelligible).
128,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  But this, this debate to continue.  We've got about a minute left though.  I want to, I want to address the tax debate.  And what you hear from Republican leaders is an unwillingness to pay the bill as you move forward to extend the Bush tax cuts."
129,REP. ARMEY:  Not at all.
130,MR. GREGORY:  Is that wrong?  You heard Alan Greenspan say that it's borrowed money...
131,REP. ARMEY:  No.  Right.
132,MR. GREGORY:  ...and that they do not pay for themselves.
133,"REP. ARMEY:  Where has Alan Greenspan been?  John--I, I was a young undergraduate watching all my faculty celebrate the genius of John F. Kennedy as he taught us you cut taxes, revenues increase.  Reagan cut taxes, revenue doubled.  What--the first, most important, critical thing for the American economy is to cut the size of the federal government.
This is a big, fat, sloppy, inefficient, obstructionist, Porky Pig that's standing in the way of economic progress for the American people.  It is counterproductive.  It's an extra weight.  It is--and it needs to be cut or this economy can't carry the weight.  This is no thinking..."
134,MR. GREGORY:  This is the argument.
135,"GOV. GRANHOLM:  This is the argument, and it's a 20th century argument, it's not a 21st century argument.  When we're competing in a global economy, the government has to partner with the private sector to create jobs. If you just slash spending, you slash the investments in the things that are going to move our economy forward, we miss out.  Just very quickly, last year, the vice president came to Michigan, said we were going to get all these battery grants; we created--we have 16 companies now in Michigan just in the past year because we partnered with the private sector creating 62,000 jobs. Strategic investment with the private sector is what works in the 20th century."
136,MR. GREGORY:  But should the Democrats be raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans during a recession?
137,"GOV. GRANHOLM:  It's--the question is, should the tax cuts expire for the wealthiest 2 percent so that we can make the investments that will grow jobs? Yes.  That's the most effective way of creating job growth.  The CBO has said that cutting taxes for the wealthiest 2 percent is the most ineffective way of creating job growth."
138,"REP. ARMEY:  I'll give you, I'll give you anywhere from--a minimum of $2 trillion to a possible $8 trillion worth of real stimulus for the economy from the private sector if we can just relieve the private sector that's sitting on its cash from the fear that this administration's going to
screw up the future of this economy.  Let them understand this administration's going to stand down from any new cockamamy ideas and not raise taxes and take away the return on an investment, and they'll put that cash to work in America."
139,MR. GREGORY:  I'm going to make that the last word.
140,GOV. GRANHOLM:  Ah!
141,MR. GREGORY:  I suspect this debate will continue as we go into the fall campaign.
142,GOV. GRANHOLM:  Thanks.
143,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor, Leader Armey, thank you both very much.  And you can keep the mug, by the way."

145,(Announcements)
146,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  And we are back with our political roundtable. Joining us this morning, The Atlantic magazine's Jeffrey Goldberg; a Republican candidate for governor of New York, former Congressman Rick Lazio; the BBC's Katty Kay; and editorial page editor for The Wall Street Journal, Paul Gigot."
147,"Welcome to all of you.  I want to explore this, this mosque debate in some greater depth.  I think it is striking that one of the more powerful Republican figures in the country, Mitch McConnell, does not want to take a stand on it. "
148,"But, Rick Lazio, you're running for governor in New York, and you have taken a stand.  In fact, you have made a point of politicizing this issue.  You've got a Web ad, and I want to play just a portion of it on the screen here."
149,(Web campaign ad)
150,ON SCREEN: What do New Yorkers think of building a mosque at ground zero? UNIDENTIFIED MAN 1: It just hit me in the gut. UNIDENTIFIED MAN 2: It doesn't have to be right here. It doesn't have to be at this site.
151,(END TAPE)
152,"MR. GREGORY:  You've been criticized by the firefighting union, police union, for using those images of 9/11.  Why have you felt strongly enough to make this a part of the campaign?  Why is it that the mosque does not belong where they say it should go?"
153,"FMR. REP. RICK LAZIO (R-NY):  Well, first of all I would say, David, there are millions of peace-loving, good Muslims in America.  This Imam Rauf is not one of them.  He's not a bridge builder.  This is a man, the very same month that people were burying their loved ones that were lost
in 9/11, he said that America was an accessory to the crime of 9/11.  He said that Osama bin Laden was created in the USA.  He refuses, only months ago, to, to distance himself from Hamas, in fact, protecting him--protecting them, and only recently one of the developers said that they would consider taking money from Iran.  Now, I don't know exactly what we think we're talking about, but 70 percent of the New York--people in New York believe that we are, we are not supportive of having this mosque, this imam in this location.  Let's be very precise about this. We're not talking about a whole religion, we're not talking about prayer. There are over 100 mosques in New York City, there are a couple of thousand in America.  Nobody's arguing for a cap on mosques.  Nobody's saying that people shouldn't have a place to pray.  What we are saying is that this person, this imam, we want to open up the books, show some
transparency, where is this money coming from?  And that's what we've been calling on Andrew Cuomo--as the attorney general..."
154,MR. GREGORY:  Jeff
155,"REP. LAZIO:  ...he's got the jurisdiction over registered charities, which is what the Cordoba Initiative is, to impose some transparency here."
156,"MR. GREGORY:  OK.  Jeffrey Goldberg, you've reported on this extensively, you know the imam.  You have a different view. "
157,"MR. JEFFREY GOLDBERG:  Look, this imam, in 2003, spoke at a memorial service for Daniel Pearl, the Jewish Wall Street Journal reporter who was killed by al-Qaeda in Pakistan, and, and he got up there and said, ""I am a Jew."" He got up in a synagogue and said, ""I am a Jew.  I identify with Judaism."" And he was, was, was declaring in front of an audience, which is very dangerous, by the way, for a Muslim cleric to do, he is, he is saying that, ""I stand against al-Qaeda and what they've done."" He's done this repeatedly.  I know him from different, different venues, different dialogue groups.  The man, in, in my personal experience, is, in fact, a bridge builder."
158,"MR. GREGORY:  This is an issue where there is a debate about this.  Paul Gigot has been thrust into the, the, the political debate.  Newt Gingrich using language, comparing this episode to putting a swastika outside the Holocaust Museum; Sarah Palin weighing in.  In fact, Karen Hughes, who was counselor, of course, to President Bush, has among the more thought
out responses to this.  And she writes this in an editorial this morning in The Washington Post.  ""A mosque at the edge of Ground Zero would be much more than a house of worship; it would be a symbol, interpreted differently by different audiences.  For some it would be the ultimate
expression of the freedom of religion we enjoy in America; for others a searing reminder of terrible deaths at the hands of murderers calling themselves Muslims.  I suspect that the terrorists might celebrate its presence as a twisted victory over our society's freedoms."" How is this being used politically all--on all sides?"
159,"MR. PAUL GIGOT:  Well, on both sides it's being, I think, abused, and it's a destructive debate.  It's an unfortunate debate.  That's why I wish the president hadn't elevated it above a local issue.  I don't know the Imam Rauf, I don't really--he's said some things about Hamas that I
wish he hadn't said, for example, that he won't condemn it as terrorists. He's also said the things that you said he, he has.  And so he's been in between, but the one thing that I think this mosque is not doing right now is achieve his goal of cross-cultural, cross-religious understanding. And if that's the case, then I think he should try..."
160,"MR. GREGORY:  But it's not built yet.  I mean, Katty Kay, who's fault is it that they're not achieving understanding when what's happening is a fierce response from people who think, ""This is salt on the wound, don't do this.  We don't want this so close to the, the site of 9/11 of Ground Zero."" "
161,"MS. KATTY KAY:  Right, David.  I mean, it's been striking, during the course of this week, how few really outspoken public defenders there are of Muslims in America, at the moment.  When you have Newt Gingrich come out and effectively equate Muslims with Nazis, you wouldn't get away with doing that with any other minority group in America.  Newt Gingrich couldn't have said that about gays or womans or Latinos and, and had any political future in this country.  There would have been a huge public outcry.  There hasn't been that, and it does lead some Muslims to question what America's relationship with Islam is.  And if--and the risk
for America here is that the war against Islamic extremism will be won partly with intelligence on the ground and partly by persuading wavering Muslims that the path of religious tolerance and openness is preferable to the path of intolerance."
162,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, and let me challenge you, Rick Lazio, on this, Congressman Lazio.  You know, General Petraeus, who we spoke to in Afghanistan last week, tells his soldiers, American soldiers fighting for America, to live our values.  That's what they're going when they're in
harm's way.  Are we living our values in this debate?"
163,"REP. LAZIO:  I think we're saying absolutely that the people of the, of the Islam faith or the Muslim faith, absolutely want people here.  We want to make sure they have places to worship, we want to have--we want to make sure people understand they are great Americans, that they are patriots, there are Muslims that lost their lives in 9/11.  It is not
about religion.  It is about this location and this imam.  Why don't people question it?  Why aren't they offended when someone will not characterize Hamas as a terrorist organization? And, in fact, one of the leaders of Hamas came out recently, this last week, to support this, this Ground Zero mosque.  Doesn't that raise some--I mean, I have just questions.  I'm saying let's get behind this, let's understand where this money is coming from.  It is--are they from foreign governments?  Are they from radical originations?  We don't know, and why can't we find out?  It seems to me that, again, if Andrew Cuomo had done his job as attorney general, we wouldn't be having this contentious debate right now."
164,MR. GREGORY:  Jeffrey.
165,"MR. GOLDBERG:  Look, look, there's a broader issue here, and the broader issue is this, we, we have serious problems with aspects of the Muslim world. We have, we have a problems with Sunni extremism as personified by Osama bin Laden.  We have a problem with Shia Muslim extremism as personified by Ahmadinejad and the regime in Iran.  We--but, but those
people don't represent the majority of Muslims in the world, and what we're doing here is signaling to the majority of Muslims, who don't like those people, who sometimes actively work against those people, who even fight on our side against those people, we're saying to you, ""It's, it's--your religion is somehow not as good as our religions."" And, and, and that is a terrible message to send.  This is--this is an actual--this is an actual national security problem. "
166,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, Paul, Paul, Paul Gigot."
167,"MR. GIGOT:  We're not saying that they can't build mosques all over the world, all over the country.  They're saying, ""We don't want it at that spot."" The analogy thinking--hold on--I think the analogy here is what John Paul II did with the Carmelite nuns when they wanted to build a convent at Auschwitz. He said, ""Look, this is a special place with special meaning for a lot of people, and it offends them to do so.  Stand down."" And nobody says the Carmelite nuns had anything to do with the Nazis."
168,"MR. GOLDBERG:  See, this is the largest Jewish graveyard in the world. There was a very specific reason that the Pope..."
169,MR. GIGOT:  The World Trade Center's a graveyard for Americans.
170,"MR. GOLDBERG:  ...but--a graveyard for everybody, including, by the way, Muslims."
171,REP. LAZIO:  But why...
172,"MR. GREGORY:  But why--but here--but, Katty Kay, why is it inappropriate to say, ""Look, religious freedom is protected in America, but it's not wise if you consider that in--you had terrorists in a perversion of Islam who committed this atrocity in the name of Islam and, with respect to the victims of 9/11, it's just not appropriate to put it there?"" Maybe 30
years from now, OK.  Right now we just can't get there."
173,"MS. KAY:  But, David, isn't that the point that you're saying that there are terrorists, extremists, a very small group who acted in the name of Islam. The risk for this country is that you--and it has been a risk since 9/11, Muslims here, moderate Muslims in America have felt this, that you start lumping all Muslims in with that group.  And that's a very dangerous strategy, not just in moral terms for America, but in political terms for America."
174,MR. GOLDBERG:  Try to--try to think how an American-Muslim soldier...
175,MS. KAY:  Another point is that Rand Paul has come out and said that America's foreign policy is partly to blame for the war on terrorism against America.  Now would you say that Rand Paul supported terrorism? Of course not.
176,REP. LAZIO:  I would say...
177,"MS. KAY:  And he said it's not just what America is, it's what America does."
178,"REP. LAZIO:  I would say that any time that the developers of this 9--this, this Ground Zero mosque say that they might consider taking money from Iran, every person ought to be concerned.  And we ought to say, ""Where is this money coming from?  Let's have a full accounting, and let's open up the books."" Why are we not outraged by that?  I don't
understand it.  And what does it say about the intent of the developers of this one mosque by this one imam?"
179,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
180,REP. LAZIO:  I think we need to be very precise about this.
181,"MR. GREGORY:  Jeffrey, final point on this, and I want to move on to a couple of other things.  Go ahead."
182,"MR. GOLDBERG:  No, the, the point is I, I try to put myself in the shoes of an American Muslim soldier in Iraq or in Afghanistan right now.  He's risking his life to bring democracy, to bring American-style values to these Muslim countries.  He's working hand-in-hand with Afghans and
Iraqis who are risking their lives to advance legitimate American interests in the--in those cases. And he looks back and he reads the papers, he goes on the Internet and he sees that politicians are equating his religion to Nazism.  How does that--how, how that person going to
feel?"
183,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
184,MS. KAY:  And where is the public defense.  I think that's almost what's more alarming about this debate...
185,MR. GREGORY:  Right.  The...
186,MS. KAY:  ...is the subsequent conversation.
187,"MR. GREGORY:  If this is a defining moment in terms of our relationship with Islam, with the Islamic world, there are other areas of conflict, like Iran and like Iraq, and let me take those in turn in a couple--just--for a couple of moments."
188,"Jeffrey, you've written the cover story on this month's Atlantic magazine, and we'll put it up on the screen.  ""Israel is Getting to Bomb Iran:  How, Why and What it Means."" This may be, in fact, one of the legacies, this threat of the Iraq war.  You write this:  ""Based on months
of interviews, I have come to believe that the administration knows it is a near-certainty that Israel will act against Iran soon if nothing or no one else stops the nuclear program; and Obama knows - as his aides, and others in the State and Defense departments made clear to me - that a nuclear-armed Iran is a serious threat to the interests of the United
States, which include his dream of a world without nuclear weapons."" Where are we?"
189,"MR. GOLDBERG:  Well, where we are is, is we're--we're at an interesting moments, sort of pre-crisis.  I can't see a way that this does not become a bigger crisis over the next year, year and a half, unless Iran takes one of the off-ramps that, that Obama has built for them.  I think the Obama administration's program right now is the prudent and smart program.  They are using both the, the, the promise of engagement and the threat of sanctions to try to change Iranian behavior.  And, and the Obama plan has been criticized from, from, from the right, certainly, but, but it, it makes sense.  The problem is, we don't know what happens if this Obama plan fails.  And Secretary of Defense Gates says that Iran is about a year to three years away from reaching a nuclear thresh--reaching a nuclear threshold.  The Israelis hear that as nine months.  So if Obama can't change Iranian behavior, and he's worked very,
very hard at this--I mean, one of his greatest foreign policy successes so far is building this multinational coalition to, to really have some strict, strident sanctions on, on Iran.  But if those fail--and I don't think many people really have great hope that they'll succeed--if those
fail, we would like to know what happens next.  He has said he is determined--that's a quote, ""determined"" to stop Iran from going nuclear. And, and this is the big looming question in foreign policy over the next year.  What does that mean?  How far will he go to stop Iran?"
190,MR. GREGORY:  And this is moving forward at a time when U.S. combat forces are withdrawing from Iraq.  Our own Richard Engel reported exclusively on that withdraw.  This is in part how it looked:
191,(Videotape)
192,RICHARD ENGEL reporting:
193,"The troops scan the roads, weapons armed.  But mostly it's a precaution. The threat is considered low.  At sunrise we first see the road.  The troops are driving down Iraq's main north/south highway--smooth, wide blacktop.  What a difference to how American troops entered Iraq.  In the 2003 invasion, U.S. forces crashed through the desert to surprise Iraqi
forces.  As they exit Iraq, the Strykers navigate through traffic on a road protected by Iraqi troops trained by American forces.  Unlike the invasion, too, the helicopters over the convoy aren't providing protection, but carry reporters taking pictures."
194,(End videotape)
195,"MR. GREGORY:  Such a striking, striking scene that was captured by  Richard Engel.  And here's The Wall Street Journal editorial on Friday with the headline ""Victory in Iraq."" Somewhere down the road the editorial writes, ""We trust that August 18, 2010 will be remembered as victory in Iraq day."" There it is, Paul Gigot.  Victory as defined how?"
196,"MR. GIGOT:  Oh, I think as defined as the United States leaving with honor, leaving with dignity, leaving with a--leaving a stable, relatively stable government behind, not to say they don't have problems, not to say that they're not disagreeing.  This government, disagreements between the two factions, the two people who've figured so closely in the election,
is troubling.  On the other hand, they're debating, they're not killing one another.  We've given them a chance, in the words of Benjamin Franklin, about our own revolution, ""You have a republic, gentlemen, if you're willing to keep--if you can keep it."" And so I think that the--we
can still get some strategic benefits from this in terms of a, a democratic government in the Middle East, one that is allied with our interests and can serve our purposes over there if things go down the road in the future--well in the future.  But consider where we were three
years ago."
197,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
198,"MR. GIGOT:  We would have been leaving with defeat and having been seen as driven out.  Instead, we did put a defeat on al-Qaeda, which tried to take over that country.  And we can leave, I think, with honor."
199,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman Lazio, are there circumstances under which we send more troops back?  We've got 50,000 still there, and there's a lot of uncertainty about the security and political future of that country. "
200,"REP. LAZIO:  I think probably not, but depending on what Iran does, what the surrounding area--surrounding nations do, you've got a situation which, I think, is still a fragile situation.  You continue to see people--I mean, we've got 50,000 troops there.  They will be in
combat-type roles.  You'll still see pilots up in the air, American pilots up in the air.  You'll, you'll still see counterterrorist activity going on by American troops.  How they get drawn in, I--you know, nobody can say for sure.  But I do believe it's more likely that we're seeing an
important step toward progress and a validation of the fact that there is a democracy that is beginning to take hold.  And to Paul's point, I think there's a lot of, of good here in terms of having an honorable withdrawal from Iraq, which was always the plan by two presidents, two different parties, a consistency of approach that we can learn something about."
201,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But, Katty Kay, if the notion in Iraq is similar to what the, the hope is in Afghanistan, which is an Iraq that's good enough to leave, an Afghanistan that's good enough to leave, is that really how we went into this conflict?"
202,"MS. KAY:  No, it's not how we went into this conflict.  And it's interesting that, you know, The Wall Street Journal is probably feeling more triumphant than the White House is certainly sounding at the moment, that they realize that there are still big risks in Iraq itself.  And, if
you remember, the neoconservative ideal was that you would have a democratic Iraq and then you'd have a domino effect throughout the rest of the Middle East.  That certainly hasn't happened.  Jordan is, in some ways, a, a more authoritarian country than it was seven years ago.  You have not had the progress of democracy by any means in Saudi Arabia.  So,
no, it's been a limited success, and there are still big questions about the political future of Iraq."
203,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  I'm going to make that the last word.  A lot to debate.  Thank you all very much.  We will leave it there.
204,We'll be right back with some news about our guests for next week's program right after this.

2,"MR. BRIAN WILLIAMS:  August 29th, 2005, Hurricane Katrina touches down on the Louisiana coast.  The city's levees fail, the next morning nearly 80 percent of New Orleans is under water.  A botched government response, a poor local evacuation plan, thousands are left without food, water, shelter or safety, trapped for days as the city is looted and its people
suffer.  Forty-one thousand people were heroically rescued by U.S. armed forces, many of them brave Coast Guard pilots, but almost 1,800 people are dead and the storm has left an estimated $75 billion in damages throughout the Gulf Coast.  Five years later, what's changed and what hasn't?  What lessons were learned?  Is this city's recovery moving in the right direction?  Joining us:  Two of the area's notable political leaders, Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu and her brother, the newly elected mayor of New Orleans, Mitch Landrieu.  Then, my interview with actor Brad Pitt, founder of the Make It Right Foundation, an effort to repair the devastated Lower Ninth Ward."

6,"MR. BRAD PITT:  These people are pioneers.  They're pioneers, and this is now the greenest neighborhood in the world."
7,(End videotape)
8,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Plus, our special discussion with three men who've worked tirelessly to bring renewal and regrowth to the city they love:  New Orleans native, star of the HBO hit series ""Treme"" and the president of the Pontchartrain Park Community Development Corporation, Wendell Pierce; longtime New Orleans journalist Garland Robinette of WWL Radio; and author of ""The Great Deluge:  Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast,"" historian and author Douglas Brinkley."
9,"MR. BRIAN WILLIAMS:  But first, and good morning from New Orleans for this special edition of MEET THE PRESS, we should set the scene here.  If you know the town, we're in the former Bella Luna, now the Galvez Restaurant, a building halfway destroyed in Katrina.  And it's part of
the plotline here, it has come back, and these days is back and prospering as a restaurant.  And here in our studio space we have nothing but Landrieus.  With us, Louisiana senior Senator Mary Landrieu and her brother, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who took office almost four
year--four months ago--I almost put you ahead of time."
10,MAYOR MITCH LANDRIEU:  It feels like four years ago.
11,"MR. WILLIAMS:  And, Mr. Mayor, let's, let's mix things up right at the top here.  We've come down here so many times in these past five years I could probably accept mail delivery by now, and you, you pick up on the local quirks.  And when you say down here that Katrina was the worst natural disaster ever, usually you're not allowed to get that sentence out, and you're interrupted and a New Orleanian says, ""Wait a minute."""
12,MAYOR LANDRIEU:  That's right.
13,"MR. WILLIAMS:  ""The levees broke."""
14,MAYOR LANDRIEU:  That's exactly right.
15,"MR. WILLIAMS:  But then a Northerner comes back and says, ""Yeah, but you're living below sea level, why is this America's problem?"" So that's the first question to you, why is New Orleans America's problem?"
16,"MAYOR LANDRIEU:  Well, first, two things:  One, it is a historical fact that this was a man-made disaster.  It wasn't a natural disaster, the levees broke. That's the reason why the catastrophe exists.  The federal government was responsible for building the levees, engineering the levees, and consequentially, the federal government is responsible for repairing the damage that has been done, which has not been completed yet.  That's first of all.  Secondly, the city of New Orleans and all of the coastal parishes along the Gulf Coast have been at the tip of the spear for this nation's fight for energy security, economic independence,
and its national security.  We produced most of the oil and gas that this country uses domestically.  We produce 30 to 40 percent of the fisheries. We produce the greatest culture that this country has ever seen.  And so it's a, it's a strange question for us when people even ask us that.  And by the way, I'll make two other points, we're not the only other place in 
America, much less the world, under sea level, and we've learned how to live peacefully in those places.  And finally, there are clear ways to fix the problem, and we should get, get about it fast."
17,"MR. WILLIAMS:  I was at a dinner where you spoke last night, and it's kind of bracing, I've seen you--seen you speak a number of times and you've used the word ""dire"" to describe your own city.  You've said you have the worst police department in America.  You raised your hand, got the Justice Department in here to help fix it.  And in your remarks, you
often say, ""I hope we make it. I hope we make it."" Is that expectations adjustment by a veteran Democrat and a political family of this, of this fine soil?"
18,"MAYOR LANDRIEU:  What, what it is, is a willingness to speak to the truth to this very simple notion, that success is not predetermined.  There is nothing here that's broken that can't be fixed, but it won't happen on its own.  It's going to require a huge lift by the entire country of the United States of America and people on the ground taking personal responsibility for themselves.  You cannot take it as a fait accompli that the city's going to come back.  We have great stories that have occurred over the past five years that will give you great hope about the resurrection and redemption of the city, and we believe that it's going in the right direction, but we have a long way to go."
19,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Senator Landrieu, before I begin with you, I want to show you a piece of videotape of another member of your family.  The--a long time ago, a newspaper columnist affectionately called the Landrieu family the ""Cajun Camelot,"" and that's the last time there was, first of all, a white mayor of the city of New Orleans before the current mayor, your dad, Moon Landrieu. What was it, 1970 to '78, a two-term mayor, former head of the Conference of Mayors, later secretary of Housing.  Senator, have you searched your own soul and conscience to make sure--there was so much blame that went around after Katrina--that you bore none of it? How--have you sorted out just what it was that happened here?"
20,"SEN. MARY LANDRIEU:  (D-LA):  Well, Brian, first of all, no elected official could say that they didn't make mistakes.  We all did.  It was an extremely tough time.  But I can say proudly that I helped to lead the effort to help the federal government respond more effectively.  Now, we
still have a long way to go and to try to tell the story that it wasn't a natural disaster, it was a man-made disaster and that the levees did break and that our coastal restoration efforts, while we had put them under way, needed to be accelerated.  And the town can't just be
protected by levees, but by the coast. So I had been doing that for quite some time."
21,"But the fact of the matter is many of us knew that Katrina and the levee break was an opportunity to transform this region and transform, not just the city, but St. Bernard and St. Tammany and Jefferson and all of the coastal areas that honestly sometimes, Brian, get overlooked by the national media that focuses on New Orleans.  As proud as we are of this
city and as extraordinary as it is, all of south Louisiana and all of the Gulf Coast is a very special place, and the federal government has underinvested in it year after year after year, whether it's education or health care.  And, as the mayor said, the federal government has taken so much.  For the last 50 years, the federal government has taken out of the Gulf Coast $165 billion in taxes that came from oil and gas off of our coast that went to the federal Treasury, to rebuild all places in America except the place that it came from."
22,"So I have been a leading voice, I'm thrilled that Mitch has joined, and many others, in saying it's time, as my father said many years ago, for New Orleans, the region, Louisiana, and the Gulf Coast to get its fair share, and we most certainly intend to do that."
23,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Now I want to ask you about one of the many promises made after Katrina.  I want to roll in a piece of sound from President George W. Bush after Katrina, speaking not far from here in Jackson Square. "
24,"(Videotape, September 15, 2005)"
25,"PRES. GEORGE W. BUSH:  And tonight I also offer this pledge of the American people:  Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes, we will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives."
26,(End videotape)
27,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Senator, you heard it."
28,SEN. LANDRIEU:  Yes.
29,MR. WILLIAMS:  Did it turn out to be hollow?  Did it turn out...
30,SEN. LANDRIEU:  It was.
31,MR. WILLIAMS:  Do you think he was telling the truth then?
32,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  Well, it, it turned out to be a hollow promise, and I'll tell you why:  Because the federal government didn't stay and do everything they could.  The federal government didn't make it easy.  They made it very, very difficult.  Very specifically, when the mayors of New Orleans and my other mayors asked for funding to help rebuild, they were offered a loan of $5 million.  The city's budget is $460 million.  The mayor of New Orleans at the time was  offered $5 million.  That wouldn't buy them a, you know, loaf of bread for the week."
33,"MR. WILLIAMS:  And yet it's said, Mississippi made out like bandits. Just next door, they had..."
34,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  Mississippi--but the fact of the matter is, Brian, that's not true, and we, we will document many things.  Mississippi did not make out like bandits.  And you're going to hear a lot about that in the next couple of years."
35,MR. WILLIAMS:  There's a couple new documentaries out.
36,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  There's a couple of documentaries that are out.  The Brookings Institute.  But the fact of the matter is, is that, you know, we were given a very small portion of the funding relative to our disaster.  We did the best we could with it, but the great thing is there
are leaders on the ground, whether it's this mayor of New Orleans, Craig Taffaro in St. Bernard Parish, and others that are building schools, hospitals, and rebuilding our coast, and giving leadership here which is so important."
37,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Mr. Mayor, you have the, as long been chronicled, the highest murder rate in the United States.  Would you yourself walk unaccompanied after dark in your own Seventh Ward? "
38,"MAYOR LANDRIEU:  I do it all the time.  And, and the answer is yes.  And it's important that people know that, at some point in time, that the city is going to be safe.  But it's also important to acknowledge, again, a speech I gave a couple of weeks ago called ""Eyes Wide Open."" The only way we're going to fix our problems is really to confront them.  And as
wonderful as some of the recovery has been in the schools and the healthcare clinics, things we'll talk about later in the program, it is also true that we have a police department that had lost its way completely.  We also have one of the highest murder rates in the country. We have to deal with that problem."
39,"Again, I should say this, that what New Orleans is going through now is not unique to us.  Katrina and Rita didn't cause all of our problems.  It certainly made them more evident.  It certainly should be looked upon as being the canary in the coal mine for the rest of this country as it deals with the issues of health care, infrastructure and crime.  We're
suffering with many things that may--every major urban city is, but the immediacy of it has been brought to bear by Katrina and Rita.  So that's why I called in the Justice Department, and they have responded wonderfully to ask us to completely redo the police department while
we're focusing on getting in front of crime with recreation programs, critically important.  But it's something that has got to get done because if this city is not safe, it'll never be free and it won't grow back up.  It's really important."
40,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, let's talk about education for a moment.  The Education secretary, Arne Duncan, famously said--and others have, have said it, though it sounds perverse when you hear it, ""Katrina was the best thing that ever happened to the school system in New Orleans."" And post-Katrina, here you are with, what, 60 percent charter schools, teachers union says, ""Oh, that's great except they've tossed the teachers union out of all of those places, and you can't educate kids on, on charter schools alone."""
41,"MAYOR LANDRIEU:  Well, let me, let me say this--and I know Senator Landrieu has had a lot to do with this particular movement.  The fact of the matter is, whether they're charter schools or public schools, in the city of New Orleans we have the most innovative change that's going on in public education anywhere in America.  In the last three years alone, our
students' scores have gone up in every category, and it is, in fact, an amazing story.  We--the other day the president announced, and Senator Landrieu changed the congressional act to allow this to happen, that we got actually a lump-sum funding, first time FEMA has ever been able to do this, to actually physically rebuild every school in the city of New Orleans.  So it, in fact, is going to be one of the great stories."
42,"Now, I wouldn't have said it the way the secretary said it.  Some people say, ""Oh, it was a great opportunity."" I think that comes out wrong.  I think it gave us the responsibility of building back something that should not ever have gotten to where it was before.  It's a, it's a huge responsibility, and it's one that we should take very strongly."
43,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Now, Senator, we should note that you were talking about wetlands before talking about wetlands was, was in vogue.  And, perhaps, though, you can explain the very confusing relationship between Louisiana and oil as we look at the once-beautiful wetlands with that now characteristic oil line that's to be found on all the grass. A lot of folks elsewhere in the country just assumed that the anger down here would come out of the oil spill, the fact that three months of oil is sitting out there in that water.  A lot of folks assumed that the folks
in Louisiana would be behind a stoppage until there could be a rule that if you can get oil a mile down, you should be able to stop it.  What is the relationship between Louisianans, who love the great outdoors and have some of the great outdoors in all of the world, and the petroleum
that comes out deep under the ground?"
44,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  Well, first of all, Brian, please know that people are very angry about that spill, and very disappointed in BP, and very disappointed in the subcontractors as well, and are just furious about the oil.  We want to keep our waters clean.  We've tried to keep our
waters clean all these years. But we do have a strong relationship with the oil and gas industry, not just big oil, but independents and the thousands of small businesses that we built that we're proud of that support that industry because the nation needs this oil.  This nation
consumes 20 million barrels of oil a day.  It did the day before the Deep Horizon exploded, it does today.  Now, we're going to transition to cleaner fuels.  And by the way, Louisiana is well positioned to be part of the energy future, not just our past.  But that's why people down here
feel so strongly.  We've been fishing in the same waters that we drill for oil.  We've been navigating all of the commerce of--not only of this country, but of the world on those same waters.  And yes, Brian, we recreate, we swim in those waters.  And we believe with the right kind of balance in policy we can do it.  So, yes, a pause was necessary.  But a six-month moratorium has put a, a blanket of fear and anxiety, and it must be lifted as soon as possible."
45,MR. WILLIAMS:  But has it hurt the industry as much as you feared?
46,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  Well, it's not--I'm not worried about hurting the industry. As I said, I'm not worried about hurting big oil, I'm worried about hurting Big Al's."
47,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, right."
48,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  Because a sandwich shop closed last week.  And that's who I'm fighting for.  I'm fighting for small businesses.  I'm not fighting for big oil.  Don't be confused.  And there are thousands of businesses in this state that are at great risk.  Meanwhile, the country keeps
guzzling the oil, but we're out of work down here.  We need to get back to work to build this region, and we intend to do so.  And the president has heard that message strongly and clearly from the people of this state."
49,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Mr. Mayor, was the administration slow off the dime when the spill happened?"
50,"MAYOR LANDRIEU:  I don't think so.  They were down here pretty quickly. And, of course, this was a much different disaster than Katrina was.  I can honestly say that they've been working very hard at it. Unfortunately, you know, the focus gets taken off of where it should be,
which is on BP.  The fact that that spill could have occurred and that this company, one of the largest in the world, did not have a plan to cap that well or capture the oil or clean the coast is something that is problematic.  Although we didn't like it, we accepted the fact that BP
had the technical expertise to the extent that anybody did.  We obviously feel now that the well is capped that the federal government needs to be very aggressive and really make sure that BP honors its responsibility to repair every bit of damage that was done."
51,"MR. WILLIAMS:  How should Ray Nagin's term as mayor be remembered, as history looks back on what happened here?"
52,"MAYOR LANDRIEU:  Well, that's a, that's a very hard thing for me to opine about, you know?"
53,MR. WILLIAMS:  Try.
54,MAYOR LANDRIEU:  We're going to let history--we're going to let history take care of itself.  I would say this.  You have not seen me talk much about what happened during the storm.  That was a cataclysmic event.  Who knows how to judge people that went through those couple of days?  I will say...
55,"MR. WILLIAMS:  But you were in it, and now you have his old job."
56,"MAYOR LANDRIEU:  Yeah.  I don't, I don't think generally that it was well done.  But I would say this, that subsequent to the storm, putting the city in a position to recover, as it were, I don't think he did a good job.  That's why I ran against him the first time, and of course, it's
why I ran the second time.  I really believe that this city can fix itself."
57,"But I will say this, just to put an exclamation point on President Bush's statements a minute ago.  There was huge damage, the damage was manmade. It was a result of the federal government's negligence.  And not withstanding all the incredible things that the people of America have done for us, we have not received enough money to repair the damage that
was done.  And when we do, we will be able to rebuild the city faster."
58,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Senator, a question about where you perform your day job. What does it say about our country, if anything at all, that at Glenn Beck's rally on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial yesterday, he was able to attract a crowd, I've seen estimates 500,000.  NBC News estimated the crowd at 300,000. A general tone of, of frustration and anger with the
current size, scope and activity of government, and the desire to reinject God into American political discourse.  What'd you take from that?"
59,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  Well, first of all, God's been a part of--big part of this country since we began.  I mean, this is a country built on faith and confidence in the Almighty.  And you can see this region right here. So, I mean, Glenn Beck's idea's not new, it's been around a long time. And one of the reasons this region is surviving is because of our faith.
What I think Glenn Beck misses is that it's not just talking, it's actually actions.  It's caring for the poor, it's caring for the sick, it is, you know, using the power of government in a positive way to meet the private sector and the nonprofits and all of our people of faith to do
right by the people.  That's where Glenn Beck's wrong."
60,"And I'll tell you another way Glenn Beck's wrong.  He and his whole crew said that this city could be rebuilt by private effort alone.  The government was terrible, the government couldn't do anything.  Do you know how many houses all of the nonprofits have built?  No more than
5,000 in five years.  Do you know how many we lost?  Two hundred thousand.  So Glenn Beck has to go back and look at the facts because he is preaching a gospel that never has existed, doesn't exist today and never will.  We follow the gospel, Mitch and I, of Jesus Christ.  We know what to do.  And so others follow other faiths, but the fact of the matter is God has been all-present.  And you can ask anyone in New Orleans, when every government left, God was still here."
61,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Mr. Mayor, we can compliment you for opening train service again, because that whistle's going to be with us for the whole hour, just behind us."
62,"MAYOR LANDRIEU:  Well, I'll take credit for it."
63,"MR. WILLIAMS:  I have to say, as a confessed New York Giants fan who has come to love your city, I have learned that you can call the New Orleans Saints just a football team at your own personal peril."
64,SEN. LANDRIEU:  Risk.
65,MAYOR LANDRIEU:  That's right.
66,MR. WILLIAMS:  Please tell--the toughest question I will ask you...
67,MAYOR LANDRIEU:  Don't even think about it.
68,MR. WILLIAMS:  ...will be to condense in 30 seconds what the New Orleans Saints and the Super Bowl victory mean to this city.
69,"MAYOR LANDRIEU:  It, it's easy.  I can do it quicker than that. Resurrection and redemption, gone from worst to best.  They proved to us that we could actually win.  This town had been so used to losing, in every aspect, that when the Saints won, when they went back into the
Superdome for that first night and beat the Atlanta Falcons, when they won the NFC championship, when they finally won the Super Bowl, it was a cataclysmic event for the people of New Orleans.  And that's when people started saying, ""You know what, we're going to make it."""
70,MR. WILLIAMS:  That was the sign.
71,SEN. LANDRIEU:  And Chris Ivory's run last night said it all--or the night before last.
72,"MR. WILLIAMS:  I'm telling you, only sports fans welcome here in New Orleans."
73,MAYOR LANDRIEU:  We like the Giants too.
74,"MR. WILLIAMS:  To both--thank you very much.  To both Landrieus, senator and mayor, thank you for coming to our table this Sunday morning."
75,MAYOR LANDRIEU:  Thank you and welcome.
76,MR. WILLIAMS:  And thank you for hosting MEET THE PRESS.
77,MAYOR LANDRIEU:  And thank you for everything that you've done for us.
78,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Thank you, Mr. Mayor."
79,"Up next here on MEET THE PRESS, my interview with Brad Pitt, whose Make It Right foundation is among those private efforts to rebuild and transform, in this case the Ninth Ward.  And recovery, the future of the city as he sees it. We'll talk to Wendell Pierce of the HBO series
""Treme."" We'll talk to local New York's--New, New Orleans, rather--boy and I going to be in trouble now--radio host Garland Robinette and historian and author Doug Brinkley, as MEET THE PRESS continues after this brief commercial break."

81,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Our special edition of MEET THE PRESS continues live from New Orleans, including my interview with Brad Pitt, right after this brief commercial break."

easy."

87,(End videotape)
88,"MR. BRIAN WILLIAMS:  Still tough to watch, even tougher to watch after these five years.  We're back with this special live edition of MEET THE PRESS here in New Orleans, five years to the day that Katrina touched down here."
89,"This past Friday I spent some time with the actor and, these days, activist Brad Pitt.  His Make It Right foundation is building affordable and storm resistant homes in the Lower Ninth Ward, three miles down the river here from the French Quarter, where we are, a place that five years
ago really became a global icon for New Orleans.  It was completely flooded and destroyed.  The force of the water surged through there from multiple levee breaks, literally forcing houses right off their foundations.  After the waters all dried up, all that remained in many
spots were the cement front steps of what used to be folks' homes where generations of families were raised.  I started our interview by asking Brad Pitt what it was about this city that kept bringing him back and inspired him to help in the effort to make it recover."
90,MR. PITT:  There's a...
91,MR. WILLIAMS:  Yeah.
92,"MR. PITT:  ...a feel and a smell and a sound that, that permeates this place that I just find intoxicating.  And I love the people and I love driving through the neighborhoods and I love walking around the streets at night.  And there's just some feeling of community and, and verve and excitement and color that I don't find anywhere else."
93,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Look at this new wall, which we watched go up.  Do you look out there and worry?  Or, because of the design, are your worries a little bit less founded?"
94,"MR. PITT:  Well, this was the first question we had to ask ourselves. Are we putting people in danger?  We got to make sure that these things are, are done right.  And so these homes are, are--they're elevated above Katrina flood waters.  They are stronger.  They're--they'll take a
Category 4, and five times stronger than code, and they all have egress to get out on top.  So, no, none of these homeowners will suffer the--those horrors."
95,"The levee's an issue.  I, I know it's better than it's been in some time. I worry about the other side.  It's two feet lower.  So this one's great, but what about the other side.  You know?  So I, I'm really not qualified to speak on the condition of the whole system.  But safety here
was one of our four main criteria.  Safety.  And, and that I feel, I feel very happy and secure about. "
96,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, that's the thing.  I'm, I'm less qualified than you to talk about the safety of the system.  And unless you're a civil engineer, you're not qualified.  So all of us who love the place and all of the people who live here are kind of at the mercy of the Army Corps."
97,MR. PITT:  Right.
98,MR. WILLIAMS:  And hope and prayers and...
99,"MR. PITT:  Right.  Right.  And, you know, they've put in $15 billion to get it right.  I don't know.  It just, it just, the, the thing that I can't get over is if they'd just done it right in the first place.  If they had just done it right in the first place."
100,MR. WILLIAMS:  Yeah.
101,"MR. PITT:  That's where this name came from, Make It Right.  That's what these homes--just do it right.  BP oil spill, just do it right.  Do it right in the first place instead of this obsession with profit margin. Just do it right."
102,"MR. WILLIAMS:  You must have been flattered that BP borrowed your, your slogan, Make It Right. "
103,MR. PITT:  Yeah.  I found that a bit dastardly as well.  A marketing...
104,MR. WILLIAMS:  For the oil spill.
105,"MR. PITT:  ...dastardly marketing move, but, you know, it's, it's in character."
106,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Tell us more about the homes, because they're unique. First of all, driving in today, first time I've been to Lower Nine in a while, it's striking, and it's happy..."
107,MR. PITT:  It's happy.
108,"MR. WILLIAMS:  ...and it looks prosperous, more prosperous than it was. Obviously, it was important to you.  You said, ""If we're going to do this, why don't we start with a new design?"" And, and tell us about that."
109,"MR. PITT:  Well, we, we thought, you know, we wanted them to be safe, of course.  We wanted them to be--they had to be affordable.  This is--they had to be built for a low-income family scenario.  And then we wanted to embed high performance, this technology.  We thought, if, if, if, you know, we got into the--into affordable housing and they're usually given
the least, let's say the worst materials."
110,MR. WILLIAMS:  Right.
111,MR. PITT:  Let's say the cheapest materials.  Let's say the most toxic materials.
112,MR. WILLIAMS:  Right.
113,"MR. PITT:  Cheap appliances that run up their bills.  Things that cause a bigger burden on the family.  And we thought, ""Well, let's see if we can make this place that suffered such devastation, let's talk to the community and see if they will invest in this idea of, of this green
technology high-performance house."" And I mean, these people are pioneers.  They're pioneers, and this is now the greenest neighborhood in the world.  That's not bad.  I want to tell you, these homes--last, last month, these homes, every one of them but one was producing more energy than they were--than they were eating.  So families were getting bills
that were $8, $12, just processing fees to tell them they didn't owe anything for utilities.  That's an amazing story.  And there's no reason now to build any other way.  There's just no reason.  So I see this place as a template for the future."
114,MR. WILLIAMS:  Our time with Brad Pitt on the top floor of one of the houses he is responsible for building there in the Lower Ninth Ward. 
115,"MR. BRIAN WILLIAMS:  And joining us now to talk more about rebuilding and recovery in the Crescent City, longtime New Orleans journalist Garland Robinette, these days of WWL Radio, the Big 870; New Orleans native, star of the HBO series ""Treme,"" and importantly, the president of the Pontchartrain Park Community Development Corporation, which we'll talk
more about, Wendell Pierce; and author of ""The Great Deluge:  Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast,"" the definitive book on what we all witnessed happen here, historian, author Doug Brinkley."
116,Welcome to you all.
117,MR. GARLAND ROBINETTE:  Thank you.
118,"MR. WILLIAMS:  For folks not familiar with the power of Garland Robinette; if you come here to New Orleans at midday and you see people just stopping and abandoning their cars, you see shipping traffic stop on the Mississippi, it's because they're listening to this guy who takes
over the radio waves. Garland, until we recently aired our own... "
119,MR. ROBINETTE:  Who's going to believe that?
120,"MR. WILLIAMS:  ...until we--until we recently aired our own documentary on MSNBC and NBC News, you told me you'd been in a dark radio studio on generators, you, you hadn't seen a lot of the pictures.  But now you, you think about this region so much, you've lived here so long, raised in the bayou south of here, four decades in New Orleans, looking back, what was
it we witnessed here, what do you think went on those few days?"
121,"MR. ROBINETTE:  To me, it was a Salvador Dali painting, it was just surreal. The United States of America couldn't take care of itself.  I've been to Banda Aceh, I've been all over the world with a company that I owned, and I've seen how we respond to disasters.  And the very thought that for five days they couldn't get here and do the job is just, to this
day, is mind-boggling."
122,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Is it too easy to throw a label on it, stamp it racism, classism?  I once asked President George W. Bush on board Air Force One, I said, ""Mr. President, if this had happened in Nantucket or New York or Chicago,"" he interrupted me and said, ""You can call me anything you want, but don't call me a racist."" That was his response to that.  What do you
think was at work here?"
123,"MR. ROBINETTE:  I don't have the expertise, sociological understanding to be able to say, but when I watched your report, I had never before seen the helicopters going over the convention center from day one, and at the Superdome.  Superdome has two helipads, the convention center has an empty lot.  You can see those people as president of the United States or Brownie or whoever you are, you can't deliver water and, and MRIs?  It,
it still didn't make any sense."
124,"MR. WILLIAMS:  And as you look around your beloved city these days, it's interesting to, to hear people answer the question, ""How's New Orleans doing? How's the recovery coming?"" How do you answer that question?"
125,"MR. ROBINETTE:  I think we're doing better than we've ever done.  I give you two words that I think is our hope, it's called Mitch Landrieu.  I think he's doing a terrific job.  We got a police chief with a PhD.  We got tons of young people, entrepreneurs coming in here.  I, I think we're
on the way.  We've got a lot of problems to fight.  The irony is, to me, I think we're the canary in the gold--in the coal mine for the rest of the country.  The rest of the country doesn't understand 30 percent of their energy sitting on wetlands, as it goes away, ""America, you're in
much bigger trouble than we were, and you refuse to look at it."""
126,"MR. WILLIAMS:  As we introduce Wendell Pierce and the work he's done in this city, I want to take a look at a piece of videotape.  This is Wendell Pierce arriving at the family home and realizing it's been flooded, decimated, looted.  It's a shell of its former self."
127,(Videotape)
128,"MR. WENDELL PIERCE:  So that's the house.  We still own it.  It's still our home, and we'll clean it up and rebuild it if we're allowed to, if the neighborhood is inhabitable, and life goes on."
129,(End videotape)
130,"MR. WILLIAMS:  That's from the HBO documentary ""When the Levees Broke."" Wendell, Pontchartrain Park, it's next door, just across the tracks, and I--and I'm sorry you have to look at that piece of videotape again, because it's tough for everybody."
131,"MR. PIERCE:  Oh, no.  No, it's been a roller coaster.  Yes, it is. "
132,"MR. WILLIAMS:  It's just across the tracks from an equal and opposite development, but how are they different, the two places?"
133,MR. PIERCE:  In which development?
134,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Pontchartrain Park as--Chantilly West, isn't it, that it's right across from?"
135,MR. PIERCE:  Gentilly Woods?
136,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Gentilly West, right?"
137,"MR. PIERCE:  Yeah, it's all--it's all one area, which we now called Pontilly. It's a--Pontchartrain Park is a neighborhood that grew out of the civil rights movement.  It was the only place where blacks could purchase homes after post-World War II, you know, segregated New Orleans.
And so, out of something ugly, my parents' generation and those pioneers of the civil rights created something beautiful, a neighborhood that was a thousand homes around a historic golf course designed by Joseph Bartholomew, who did most of the courses in New Orleans but, because he was African-American, he couldn't play on them.  But what they did was
they made a bucolic neighborhood that everyone has a desire to be in, and it became an incubator for talent, you know, first..."
138,MR. WILLIAMS:  And it became a model.  The crime rate way below the city average.
139,"MR. PIERCE:  Right.  Ninety-seven percent home ownership, less than 10 percent..."
140,MR. WILLIAMS:  Poverty rate way below...
141,"MR. PIERCE:  ...poverty, which in the city had like 28 percent poverty. An incubator for talent.  First black mayor, Dutch Morial, his son Marc Morial became mayor, now National Urban League president, and our own EPA administrator right now, Lisa Jackson, who is around the corner from our demonstration homes, which are, you know, League-certified platinum now with geothermal and solar, solar power.  So it was a place that my parents, the Moses generation, handed off to us, the Joshua generation, and gave us a foundation to go out and be successful men and women in the world.  And when I came home that day and, and saw it destroyed, I
thought it was dead and gone forever. "
142,"MR. WILLIAMS:  And you come back here, you're an actor, you've got, you've got series and, and films going on, you're not a developer; but you come back and see the inequity of the kind of scattershot recovery effort and you went to work."
143,"MR. PIERCE:  Yeah, what happened, Brian, and what's happening now here in New Orleans, what's on display is the greatest demonstration of the American aesthetic in a generation since we rebuilt Europe with the Marshall Plan. Because we are doing it from the grass roots up, and
that's the thing--that's the story that has to be told.  Because people are taking the time to step back, reflect on their complicity and the dysfunction that was happening prior to the disaster and during the disaster and after, and they said, ""What is going to be my contribution
to the dysfunctional dynamics that are here and changing the paradigm?"" And that's the call to action that people heard and said, ""I'm going to step up to the plate,"" across this city, ""and we're going to exercise our right of self-determination and rebuild it ourselves."" And that's the,
the, the germ of Pontchartrain Park Community Development Corporation, its past and present residents who came together and decided to create their own development corporation and rebuild homes.  But not just infield homes, to replace them, but better.  We wanted 21st century solutions, so that's why we decided to make sure that they were
lead-certified, silver, gold and platinum, solar and geothermal, just like Mr. Pitt's homes.  We dare say that we would put them right up next to his."
144,MR. WILLIAMS:  And this is how New Orleans rebuilds itself.
145,"Doug Brinkley, you've spoken about and, as I said, written the definitive history of what we all witnessed here.  You've also gotten into a little bit of a scrape with a local columnist.  When you talk about the New Orleans psyche and a, a, a kind of syndrome in this city, what is New
Orleans when you're asked for a definition?"
146,"MR. DOUGLAS BRINKLEY:  Well, first off, it's--you know, when we're looking at this fifth anniversary, we have to remember Mississippi got whacked, too, and..."
147,MR. WILLIAMS:  Absolutely.  We mentioned that at the--at the top of the broadcast.
148,MR. BRINKLEY:  Yeah.  And...
149,MR. WILLIAMS:  Terrible destruction.  I passed over the state of Mississippi.
150,"MR. BRINKLEY:  Yeah.  And, and so yesterday with Congressman John Lewis, we went out to places like Waveland Bay, St. Louis, and trying to honor what happened out there, too.  Here in New Orleans, it's--you're--we're sitting in a great history center.  Mississippi River, we're looking at a steamboat right here, Nicholas Roosevelt first came down; the Cabildo is right across the street from you, Louisiana Purchase transfer, Plessy vs. Ferguson case held; Walt Whitman conceived ""Leaves of Grass"" right here. This is a great historical city and it has to be proud of its history."
151,"But too often the politicians here have been corrupt.  You had Bill Jefferson, that's a congressman during Katrina, is in jail.  Edwin Edwards in jail. There are toxic superfund sites that are buried here between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, it's called Cancer Alley.  When you love your state and you love your country, you have to be good conservationists and good stewards.  And I feel Louisiana turned--became treated like a third-world place because people wanted to make money and they didn't do the tough things that needed to be done to save the wetlands.  It's been a lot of talk for generations.  And I think President Obama's coming here now, and this community has to be loud, and they have to--they, they can't be shy.  We have to speak out and say, ""We must save America's wetlands."" If not, you're just saying, ""Go, Saints. Go, Bourbon Street,"" and you're watching your environment collapse."
152,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Garland, when we went to Mississippi many times, Waveland, it's easy to see and understand what happened there.  It just got--it got swept--it got wiped clean.  Here we had the, the complication of 80 percent of this city under water.  We have the, the, the only game in town protecting this city, and that is the system of, of levees and flood walls.  The actor and activist Harry Shearer coming out with a new documentary he's going to show tomorrow, selected cities around the country and then hopefully on cable TV, all about the Army Corps of Engineers.  You've been talking about the wetlands, thinking about the
wetlands for years.  Is it going to be perversely that the BP money may fund, because of oil in that water, may fund this Marshall Plan that Doug Brinkley's talking about?"
153,"MR. ROBINETTE:  Personally, I think it's our only chance.  I think with the ineptitude of government to realize--and, and forget New Orleans and Louisiana.  Your security, America, your gas at the pump--every time we have a slight hurricane your, fuel goes up.  If we have a big one that wipes out all the wetlands, you're going to pay $5 a gallon to begin with.  But the president doesn't pay attention to it, Congress doesn't pay attention to it. And the fact of the matter is, without us--go back--we are the canary in the coal mine.  If we go, you're in deep
trouble just economically and securitywise.  But just like New Orleans would not listen to that--I did 16 documentaries from 1970 to 1986, and I was Mr. Gloom and Doom.  I'm Mr. Gloom and Doom again for the country. And once again, when you and I go to dinner and we talk to people about this, there's a dull glaze that goes over their eyes.  I don't know why the human animal isn't interested in survival."
154,"MR. WILLIAMS:  I want to break that dull glaze by--and this is an essential part of this coverage, I believe, reminding people what it was like back then. Here is a clip from MEET THE PRESS the Sunday after Katrina that was beamed around the world.  The president of Jefferson
Parish, Aaron Broussard, pleading with Tim Russert and the authorities who might be watching television to send help."
155,"(Videotape, September 4, 2005)"
156,"MR. AARON BROUSSARD:  Nobody's coming to get us.  Nobody's coming to get us. The secretary's promised, everybody's promised.  They've had press conferences.  I'm, I'm sick of the press conferences.  For God sakes, shut up and send us somebody."
157,(End videotape)
158,MR. WILLIAMS:  Aaron Broussard on live television.
159,"And here's something else, a gentleman named Tony Zumbado, a longtime veteran NBC News cameraman.  I was last in Haiti with Tony.  We've been all over the world.  He's here with us in this city on this trip.  Tony went down to the convention center and just using his personal decency went on television in front of a live camera to break the news to the country what the federal government was seemingly unaware of, the fact that people were dead and dying and abandoned without food, water or care at the convention center because they did what they were told, they went there to seek shelter and help.  Tony Zumbado on live television."
160,(Videotape)
161,"MR. TONY ZUMBADO:  I got to tell you, I thought I seen it all.  I've never seen anything in my life like this.  These people are very desperate."
162,Unidentified Woman #1:  Those police officers pass us up.
163,Unidentified Man #1:  No food.
164,Woman #1:  We tried to stop them and...
165,Man #1:  No water.
166,"MR. ZUMBADO:  These are the families who listened to the authorities. They were told to go to the convention center.  There's nothing offered to them--no water, no ice, nothing for the last four days."
167,Unidentified Woman #2:  We have not eaten.  We have not had anything to drink.
168,"MR. ZUMBADO:  The sanitation was unbelievable, the stench in there."
169,Unidentified Man #2:  Nobody tried to do nothing for this man's mom.
170,"MR. ZUMBADO:  Dead people around the walls of the convention center, laying in the middle of the street where they died, right there in a wheelchair."
171,Man #2:  National Guard did not do nothing.
172,"MR. ZUMBADO:  I just tell you, I couldn't take it."

174,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Tony Zumbado at the time, five years ago."
175,"Wendell, it's a tough question.  That's tough to look at.  It's..."
176,"MR. PIERCE:  Yes, it is."
177,"MR. WILLIAMS:  It's yesterday, really, and it's been five years.  The children and relatives of the people at this table, I'm going to go ahead and guess, would not have gone a week without water or food because their dads, their dads' companies would have found a way, as NBC News did, as NBC News did, to get us supplies in the central business district.  They
found us in Metairie in the parking lot of a used car dealer, and they made sure we had something to drink.  What's the difference?  Why didn't it matter to someone? Why wasn't someone able to, to get supplies and get those folks out?"
178,"MR. PIERCE:  I think the thing that you have to remember is that we have to understand that the disaster lifted the veil of issues of race, of issues of class, not only in this city, but in the country.  If we're to move past it and truly be a part of this wonderful recovery that we're
feeling, we can't look at it through rose-colored glasses.  It is not an indictment of any one person or whatever, it's an indictment of us all. We have to look at all of the issues that cause the fermentation of that poverty.  One of the things that we can't lose sight of is the fact that
many New Orleanians heard that call from Garland Robinette on their transistors radios in the hinterlands of New Orleans, and we tried to make a Dunkirk run to that convention center--white, black, rich, poor--because they had the humanity within them when they saw those
images and when they heard those voices cry out.  This was an abject failure and incompetence of our government.  No one's feet have been held to the fire because of it.  We can sit here and debate the pathology of what caused it--racism, classism, a lack of respect for New Orleans and this region.  But does that matter if we don't hold anyone accountable
and if we forget the incompetence that was displayed during that week? We have to hold people accountable.  If we're not going to go back and hold those people accountable, make sure that we held--hold people accountable now as we move forward.  And if we're truly to move past this, we have to look at ourselves and see what is our contribution to
this dysfunctional dynamic, and how can we change the paradigm, the dysfunction of class and racism, the dysfunction of education, which is the root cause of all of this.  It's easy to play the blame game, but I would rather take that energy and effort and let's put solutions on the table.  That's what I tell my community all the time.  We have done more from the grass roots up with nongovernment organizations and with charities, with Ponchartrain Park Community Development Corporation and Make It Right and Catholic Charities and Rebuilding Together..."
179,"MR. WILLIAMS:  The Musicians' Village, Harry Connick Jr.'s..."
180,MR. PIERCE:  ...Salvation Army.  We have...
181,MR. WILLIAMS:  Yeah.
182,"MR. PIERCE:  We have all of those people who've come together.  So let that be an example to government of how people of all stripes, of all classes, can bring solutions to the table."
183,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Doug Brinkley, what happened to that national conversation we were all supposed to have about what was exposed by Katrina?"
184,"MR. BRINKLEY:  Oh, we got amnesia.  People forget quickly.  You've stayed with this, Brian, since day one, and everybody here loves you for that. But a lot of the media just goes away.  They come back for fifth anniversaries.  You know, when I was watching that--and I was here during the storm and saw all of this.  It's just, it's--it became the moment where we--where New Orleans, the--which is--there are no--there's only Entergy, one Fortune 500 company here.  If you go up to Minneapolis, St. Paul, there are 20.  So there's not a lot of private sector money.  We're not a rich city.  And so the--Katrina kind of ripped the lid off of a
community, and it showed poverty, it showed schools that didn't work, corrupt police force.  This happens in too many of our urban areas.  And we haven't really taken it--tackled it.  In many ways, people have tried to say it's just a New Orleans problem.  I think what Garland is saying, we're--it could be you tomorrow.  If there were a natural disaster or an
engineering failure--there's a story in today's New York Times about bad infrastructure in this country.  And so we've got to save our great city. This--New Orleans is loved all over the world.  You just say it, and people think of it as, as Rome or as, you know, Rio or something.  It's one of the great cities, yet our country seems indifferent to it.  And we
have leaders like Mary Landrieu--incidentally, Governor Blanco, during Katrina, is the one who eventually got the buses to get those people out of the convention center. And she's the one who got the Superdome refixed, but she's also not given credit for that."
185,MR. WILLIAMS:  Garland...
186,"MR. PIERCE:  You also have to remember, with those people, we, here at New Orleans, we have to give them an opportunity to come home, too.  And there's been an effort of those who don't have their best interest at heart that want to keep them out of the city.  And so I just wanted to make sure that we know that there's a, there's a large section of New
Orleanians who haven't had the opportunity to come back. "
187,"MR. WILLIAMS:  Radio guy, last word.  You know 20 seconds when you hear it. Is the glass half full or half empty for your hometown? "
188,"MR. ROBINETTE:  Definitely half full.  I think we're coming back better than we were before.  Different, but better."
189,"MR. WILLIAMS:  To my friends, Wendell Pierce, who always plays the guy trying to, to borrow cab fare on the great series ""Treme,"" thank you."
190,MR. PIERCE:  Yeah.
191,"MR. WILLIAMS:  To Garland Robinette, to Doug Brinkley, the great historian, we'll have to leave it there for now.  Thanks to all of you for joining in this discussion."
192,We're back from New Orleans right after this.

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, as the president makes a surprise one-day trip to Afghanistan, Washington feels the full weight of a sour economy, with the jobless rate creeping up to 9.8 percent in November, a seven-month high. But still, no deal on taxes or unemployment benefits despite a summit-like sitdown between the president and Republican leaders, and a Democratic attempt to force the issue in the House.

8,"MR. GREGORY:  Can there be agreement?  And what about the rest of the crowded agenda for the lame-duck session of Congress and beyond?  The START nuclear arms treaty with Russia, the ban on gays and lesbians in the military, and the now stalled debt commission report.  At the center of it all, my lead newsmaker guest this morning, Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and for the Democrats, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, John Kerry of Massachusetts. "
9,"Then, America's anxiety.  When will the economy turn around?  Are taxes going up?  How vulnerable are we to another terrorist attack?  Can anything get done in Congress?  And who leads us out of this sense of limbo?  Our roundtable weighs in:  from The New York Times, columnists Tom Friedman and David Brooks; Republican strategist Mike Murphy; and the
BBC's Katty Kay."
10,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
11,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
12,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  A political showdown yesterday, as the Senate met in a special Saturday session, Republicans blocked an effort to extend tax cuts to the middle class only, which would have raised tax rates on higher earners. The president, speaking after the vote, seemed to keep a door open to compromise."
13,"(Videotape, yesterday)"
14,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  We need to redouble our efforts to resolve this impasse in the next few days to give the American people the peace of mind that their taxes will not go up on January 1.  It will require some compromise, but I'm confident that we can get it done."
15,(End videotape)
16,"MR. GREGORY:  Joining me now exclusively, the top Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky."
17,Welcome back to the program.  Welcome to the studio.  Good to have you here.
18,SEN. MITCH McCONNELL (R-KY):  Good morning.  Good morning.
19,MR. GREGORY:  So where are we?  Are you close to a deal with the president on taxes?
20,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, let's put it this way, we've had more conversations in the last two weeks than we've had in the last two years, and I think that's a good sign.  A growing awareness that the power's going to be more symmetrical in the next Congress, and I'm optimistic we'll be able to come together."
21,MR. GREGORY:  And so what are the contours of what the deal might look like?
22,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, I'm not going to negotiate it here on, on MEET THE PRESS this morning.  But I think you're, you're familiar with all the issues that are extant.  The big, the big issue on the public mind, of course, is whether or not we're going to raise taxes on anybody in the middle of a recession.  And it is almost laughable that we were in session yesterday.  It reminded me of the old movie ""Groundhog Day."" We just kind of keep doing the same thing over and over and over again.  The voting, once again, on the tax issue, it could have been dealt with at any point during the course of the year.  Here we are at the end of the year.  I think it's pretty clear now taxes are not going up on anybody in the middle of this recession.  We're discussing how long we should maintain current tax rates.  And there are other issues that many people feel are important to address on unemployment compensation."
23,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let, let's break some of those down.  How long of an extension would--could you agree to?  Because there's a lot of talk of it being temporary, a year or two."
24,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, I, I don't want to frustrate you, but I'm not going to negotiate that here on the show this morning.  You know, I... "
25,"MR. GREGORY:  But the notion of a temporary extension is something that you could live with, whatever that exact figure is?"
26,SEN. McCONNELL:  I would prefer to do it permanently.
27,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
28,"SEN. McCONNELL:  And you and I have discussed that on earlier shows.  I think the current tax rate is appropriate for our country.  It's been in place for, for 10 years.  Obviously, the president won't sign a permanent extension of the current tax rate, so we're going to have some kind of extension.  I'd like one as long as possible."
29,MR. GREGORY:  But you're comfortable that rates are not going to go up on anyone in America?
30,"SEN. McCONNELL:  I'm very hopeful that, that rates are not going to go up. And what we saw yesterday in the Senate, every single Republican and five Democrats voted that we shouldn't be raising taxes on anybody.  In other words, it's bipartisan opposition to raising taxes on anybody at this time."
31,"MR. GREGORY:  What about extending unemployment benefits?  You have said in the past we're in the middle of a jobs crisis.  That being the case, could you then agree to an extension of jobless benefits as part of any tax cut package?"
32,"SEN. McCONNELL:  I, I think we will extend unemployment compensation. We've had some very vigorous debates not--in, in the Senate, not about whether to do it, but whether to pay for it as opposed to adding it to the deficit.  All those discussions are still under way."
33,MR. GREGORY:  Do you sense there is a mandate from the American people to keep tax rates where they are? 
34,"SEN. McCONNELL:  I and my members feel that the American people feel strongly that taxes shouldn't go up.  I know our colleagues on the other side don't see it that way.  But, look, all of, all of Republicans in the Senate, and a significant number of Democrats, feel the same way.  It isn't going to happen."
35,"MR. GREGORY:  What about the impact on jobs?  Senator Reid, on the floor of the Senate this week, said it's, it's fantasy to believe somehow this is going to be helpful to the jobs situation.  This is what he said. "
36,"(Videotape, Friday)"
37,"SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV):  They can pretend giving the rich tax breaks creates jobs even though we know from the past decade that it doesn't. If that were the case, Mr. President, the economy would be booming. "
38,(End videotape)
39,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Let me, let me give you some figures that aren't fantasy. Over 700,000 small businesses pay taxes as individuals.  They would be hit by raising the top rate above $250,000; 700,000 of our most productive and effective small businesses.  That's 50 percent of small business income and 25 percent of the work force in the middle of a recession."
40,"MR. GREGORY:  Democrats do point out a lot of those people include some, some people who are doing quite well, whether they're law partners or other individual business owners who are not exactly, you know, the typical small, you know, business owner, mom and pop store."
41,"SEN. McCONNELL:  I understand that.  But the question is, is it a good idea to raise taxes on 700,000 small businesses, affecting 50 percent of small business income, in the middle of a recession, when we know that small business is the biggest job generator in our country?  I mean, I--you know, look..."
42,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but you've had these tax rates in place since 2001. What's been the impact on jobs?"
43,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Imagine, imagine how much worse it would been if we'd had the, the higher tax rate.  Look, this argument's over, David.  You and I can continue to engage in it, but it's over.  The Senate voted yesterday, and every Republican and five Democrats said we're not raising taxes on anybody in the middle of a recession."
44,"MR. GREGORY:  And bottom line on, on the extension of the tax rates, unemployment benefits being extended, you see a compromise here in short order."
45,"SEN. McCONNELL:  I, I think the American people expect us to work together to make sure their taxes don't go up, and we're working on that package.  We've had, as I said, we've had more conversations in the last two weeks than in the last two years, and I think we're going to get there."
46,"MR. GREGORY:  And, and assuming that that's the case, would that also open the door then for debate and actual ratification of the START nuclear arms treaty with Russia?"
47,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Look, I don't set the agenda in the Senate.  What we have said--42 Republicans sent our friends on the other side of the aisle a letter earlier this week saying the two things we need to do first, decide what people's tax rates are going to be come January 1, and decide how we're going to fund the government for the next 10 months.  We haven't done that either. Once you get those two things out of the way, what we do the balance of the session is up to the majority leader.  He sets the schedule.  He will have to decide whether or not to bring up the treaty."
48,MR. GREGORY:  Do you see it being ratified in a lame-duck session?
49,"SEN. McCONNELL:  I have no idea what, what the outcome of that will be."
50,MR. GREGORY:  Are you prepared to vote to ratify it?
51,SEN. McCONNELL:  I haven't made a decision on how I'm going to vote on that yet.
52,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me talk about the debt.  The deficit commission proposal came out this week, and here are just some of the highlights. And tough medicine here in terms of what they propose.  Social Security: Raise the retirement age, cut future benefit increases.  On taxes:
Eliminate mortgage deduction, increase federal gas tax by 15 cents per gallon.  Federal spending: Cap security, nonsecurity spending; freeze federal pay for three years; eliminate congressional earmarks.  You said on the program back in August, if this was a credible proposal you'd be behind it.  You had three senators who you appointed to this commission,
all of whom voted for it."
53,SEN. McCONNELL:  Mm-hmm.
54,MR. GREGORY:  Are you now prepared to endorse this and be a catalyst to get some of these measures passed?
55,"SEN. McCONNELL:  First, let me say I was extremely proud of my appointments: Senator Coburn, Senator Crapo, Senator Gregg.  They supported it not because they liked every part of it, because they, because they thought that this comprehensive recommendation underscored
how deep-seated this problem is. This is an enormous problem.  I think the message to us is: Let's see what we can do with the president.  You cannot do entitlement reform--and for, for your viewers, entitlements mean long-term liabilities set by law.  We don't even vote on them every year.  Some--many of them very popular:  Social Security, Medicare and the like.  You cannot do entitlement reform with just one party.  You can only do entitlement reform on a bipartisan basis.  So I think the message to us coming out of this deficit reduction report is: It's time for the president of the United States, and people like John Boehner and myself and others, to sit down and talk about what we can do to make sure that we have the same kind of country for our children and our grandchildren that our parents left for us."
56,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but, Senator, people have been hearing this a long time, and politicians make these promises. "
57,SEN. McCONNELL:  Yeah.
58,MR. GREGORY:  The president said there's got to be broad sacrifice.
59,SEN. McCONNELL:  Yeah.
60,"MR. GREGORY:  Why can't you say whether you'll specifically endorse this plan, and what your, what you intend to do as a party, as the leader... "
61,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, David..."
62,"MR. GREGORY:  ...to, to, to make some painful choices?"
63,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, it would be absolutely irresponsible to sit here on a Sunday talk show and blow the talks by starting to endorse and rule out things.  What I'm saying is, this is the road map.  We need to sit down with the president, see what we can do together, because the only way we will actually accomplish something--I want to actually accomplish something."
64,MR. GREGORY:  But do you endorse these specific proposals?
65,"SEN. McCONNELL:  What I endorse is the, the effort to underscore the, the, the magnitude of the problem, and I'm prepared to sit down with the president and figure out what we can do on a bipartisan basis.  That's what this report was about.  Now it's time to do something."
66,MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about this WikiLeaks controversy.  How much damage has been done here?  What's the real story here that you're focused on?
67,SEN. McCONNELL:  I think the man is a high-tech terrorist.  He's done an enormous...
68,MR. GREGORY:  Assange.
69,SEN. McCONNELL:  Yeah.
70,MR. GREGORY:  Who runs WikiLeaks
71,"SEN. McCONNELL:  He's done an enormous damage to our country.  And I think he needs to be prosecuted to the, the fullest extent of the law; and if that becomes a problem, we need to change the law.  I think it's done enormous damage to our country and, and to our relationships with our allies around the world."
72,"MR. GREGORY:  Is there a question of incompetence here in the Obama administration, in your mind, about how this happened?"
73,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, I'm sure that they're, they're going to pursue the way it happened internally as well.  I hear that they know who, who did it.  That individual also should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  And they need to be looking at how we can avoid this in the future."
74,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, that is the issue of information sharing, and Secretary of State Clinton has said, you know, part of the problem, after 9/11, more of an emphasis on information sharing.  In fact, the Pentagon, she specifically said, has more access to a lot of these cables, and ultimately that's where Private Manning, who is accused of doing this, got that information.  Is information sharing the problem?  The ability to download information in the, in the government?"
75,"SEN. McCONNELL:  I don't know, but we sure need to look at it thoroughly because this is a huge problem."
76,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to ask you, finally, about your measure of the, the president politically at this juncture.  You had an opportunity to sit down with him.  You said at the outset of this interview, it's more talking you've done with him face-to-face than you've done in a while, as
you've met with other congressional leaders and the president on Tuesday. Here is where the president stands politically compared to Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton at a similar juncture after they faced a tough midterm race.  And you look at his approval rating, he actually rates a bit higher, which is counter to the conventional wisdom, because he's taken quite a licking here.  What's your assessment of his political strength as a, as a political adversary for you?"
77,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, the political thing will play out over the next two years, but the thing we need to do now is to figure out how we can work together.  The American people didn't send us here to do nothing for the next two years.  In fact, we've had a regularly scheduled election every two years since 1788 in this country, and I think--what I hope will happen is the president will hear the message of the American people.  I think they spoke rather loudly and rather clearly.  One pundit described it as a restraining order against what we've been doing the last two years, this splurge of spending and debt and Washington takeovers.  That
needs to stop.  And hopefully we can focus on things that we can agree on.  For example, the president has apparently secured an agreement with, with Korea with regard to trade.  That's something I'm very likely to support, can support."
78,"MR. GREGORY:  And do you consider that a big accomplishment by him? Because he was criticized roundly leaving South Korea without that free trade deal, and he got it.  He waited for it and he got it. "
79,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, regardless of how he left South Korea, if he now has an agreement, that's something we ought to go forward with.  And by the way, we ought to do the Colombia agreement and the Panama agreement as well, which has been languishing for years."
80,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator, the question I ask here is about his political strength.  You, you have said that your goal is to make him a one-term president."
81,SEN. McCONNELL:  Well...
82,MR. GREGORY:  That's what you told the National Journal.
83,SEN. McCONNELL:  ...his goal is to be a two-term president.
84,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
85,"SEN. McCONNELL:  I mean, so what's unusual about that?"
86,MR. GREGORY:  What makes you think he's vulnerable enough to be a one-term president that you could succeed?
87,SEN. McCONNELL:  Look.  I don't think that we ought to be talking about what's going to happen two years from now.
88,MR. GREGORY:  But you did talk about it.
89,"SEN. McCONNELL:  He--well, but you know..."
90,"MR. GREGORY:  You said you wanted him to be a one-term president, that that was your goal."
91,"SEN. McCONNELL:  He wants to be a two-term president, I want him to be a one-term president.  The American people have put us both in charge for two more years, and we need to have a relationship with each other and see what we can do working together.  I hope he pivots and starts helping us reduce spending, reduce debt, ratify trade deals.  He, he's in favor
of nuclear power, so are most of my members.  There are things we can do together for the American people that would be very important in the next two years."
92,MR. GREGORY:  You predicted he'd become a born-again moderate.  Is that...
93,SEN. McCONNELL:  I sure hope so.
94,MR. GREGORY:  Is that--but is that playing out in this tax debate?
95,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, we'll find out.  We'll find out."
96,MR. GREGORY:  But you're confident it will.
97,"SEN. McCONNELL:  You know.  Dan Balz wrote in the Post this morning the two models we've been looking at for six months, the Harry Truman model and the Bill Clinton model.  Truman decided to run against the Congress, worked for him in 1948.  Clinton decided to do things with the Congress, it worked for him in '96.  Those are decisions the president's going to have to make.  My view is, we're all here to do the people's business for the next two years. To the extent that the president wants to do things that I and my members are comfortable with, we want to do that for the country."
98,"MR. GREGORY:  Is he tougher than a lot of people think in terms of being politically vulnerable, in your mind?"
99,"SEN. McCONNELL:  I--look, I, I like him personally.  We have different political agendas, but some of--there, there will be some overlap, and hopefully we can find a way to work together."
100,"MR. GREGORY:  Before you go this morning, ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell""... "
101,SEN. McCONNELL:  Yes.
102,"MR. GREGORY:  ...the ban on gays and lesbians in the military, a lot of activity on that this week.  Will that ban be lifted?"
103,"SEN. McCONNELL:  It's a--you know, people are talking like that, that isthe only issue.  That defense bill also has abortions in military hospitals.  Once you get on the defense bill, it typically takes two weeks.  I don't see how we can possibly finish the Defense Authorization Bill, a two-week bill, wholly aside from these controversial items that are in it--there are a whole lot of other things in it--before the end of the year."
104,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  But even as you get into January, in your mind, do you think the support is there to lift the ban in Congress?"
105,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, my, my personal view is that Senator McCain is correct on this.  I intend to follow his lead.  We'll find out when we finally get around to debating this bill, which I think will not be before the end of the year."
106,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Senator McConnell, thank you very much for being here."
107,SEN. McCONNELL:  Thank you.
108,MR. GREGORY:  Appreciate it.
109,"Coming up, the view from the Democrats on all the looming battles in Congress--tax cuts, the deficit commission, gays in the military and more. Senator John Kerry will be here coming up next.  Plus, our political roundtable weighs in:  from The New York Times, columnists Tom Friedman and David Brooks; Republican strategist, Mike Murphy; and the BBC's Katty Kay."

111,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up, the politics of the lame duck session.  What can Congress get done before January?  My exclusive guest, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Democrat John Kerry, up next after this brief commercial break."
112,(Announcements)
113,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We are back, joined now by the other side of the aisle, Democrat from Massachusetts, Senator John Kerry."
114,Welcome here.  Good to have you in the studio as well.
115,SEN. JOHN KERRY (D-MA):  Delighted to be here.
116,"MR. GREGORY:  So, so look, the big news is tax cuts, unemployment benefits. Senator McConnell was careful in his language, but seems to be suggesting a deal is at hand.  Where are we?"
117,"SEN. KERRY:  Well, David, I think that there will be an agreement because yesterday's vote made it very, very clear this enormous divide between the Republicans and the Democrats.  The Republicans are fighting to keep in place a tax policy that has failed over the last eight years.  It has failed.  We have had a net loss of jobs.  And what we've seen is a
Republican Party that's absolutely prepared to deny unemployment insurance to people who have been laid off, who can't pay their bills, who want to, you know, put food on the table for their families.  They've said, ""No, we're willing to hold that hostage so that we can give the
wealthiest people in the country a bonus tax cut."" And what I mean by that is, you know, people aren't focused on the fact that, under the Democratic proposal, everybody in America got a tax cut.  The wealthiest people in America got a tax cut, up to the $250,000 of income. What they're fighting for is to give those people who earned more than a million dollars a year a bonus tax cut above that, even though it's the least effective way of creating jobs and, and putting impact into the economy."
118,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator, isn't it true that the president's own economic advisers have said to him at this juncture, ""Look, you may feel like you've drawn a line in the sand, no extension on the tax cuts for wealthy Americans. But uncertainty right now in the economy means that
you could lose more jobs. You could have a worsening job situation if you
don't..."""
119,SEN. KERRY:  Let me tell you...
120,"MR. GREGORY:  ""...if you don't extend these tax cuts for now..."""
121,SEN. KERRY:  Yeah.
122,"MR. GREGORY:  ""...for a temporary period""?"
123,"SEN. KERRY:  We're--we want to extend the tax cuts for every single
American, but up to a level that makes sense in terms of our economy.
You talk about uncertainty of the economy, how much uncertainty is there
to our economy when you add $800 billion to the deficit."
124,"MR. GREGORY:  But the, but the..."
125,SEN. KERRY:  How much...
126,"MR. GREGORY:  ...president seems willing to deal, is the point.  I
mean..."
127,"SEN. KERRY:  Well, obviously."
128,MR. GREGORY:  ...there may be a disagreement about this still...
129,SEN. KERRY:  But I think...
130,MR. GREGORY:  ...but he seems willing to deal.
131,"SEN. KERRY:  I think it's critical for people to understand what the Republican--how bankrupt, how fundamentally reckless their position is and has been.  And the fact is--I mean, let me go a little bigger here for a minute. Our country is challenged economically as never before. You know, people talk about American exceptionalism and how there's sort of this automatic for America.  Yes, we are exceptional, but we're exceptional when we do exceptional things, when we behave exceptionally. We're not doing that today. We're locked down into a gridlock status
where other countries are racing by us.  I'll give you an example.  Over the next 20 years, $600 billion is going to be invested in green technology and green energy.  New jobs.  New jobs that could be for Americans.  Ninety percent of that investment's going to be in other
countries, David."
132,MR. GREGORY:  What about the Chinese?
133,"SEN. KERRY:  By the Chinese and by a lot of other people.  You know, two years ago China produced 5 percent of the world's solar panels.  Today they produce 60 percent.  We're not even in the game.  We, we invented this technology at the Bell Laboratories 50 years ago.  We don't have one company in the top 10 companies of the world.  Shame on us.  The point I'm making is that you can't just talk about American exceptionalism and then sit around and feed the frenzy of this tax cut at the upper end. You've got to invest in America's future."
134,"MR. GREGORY:  But, you know, a lot of viewers will look at this, especially liberals, Senator..."
135,SEN. KERRY:  Yeah.
136,"MR. GREGORY:  ...and they'll say, ""Absolutely right.  Senator Kerry's got it exactly right.  Then why is the president caving to the Republicans?"" "
137,SEN. KERRY:  He's not.
138,"MR. GREGORY:  What is the, wait a minute, but what is the political fallout if the president makes a deal where he might get an extension of unemployment benefits, but all of these tax cuts are, are extended for a period of time, including on the wealthy Americans."
139,"SEN. KERRY:  Well, let me tell you what the president is fighting for, and appropriately.  And, and first of all, the president's not caving. The president insisted that we have the votes that we had yesterday so that America could see what the Republicans are fighting for, and they
could see what we're fighting for.  His preferred position is $250,000. Give every American a tax cut up to say, $250,000, but don't, don't put money back into the pockets of people who may never invest it in the United States.  I mean, if you're earning more than $1 million a year,
you--you're--that investment, when, when you give that tax cut, you get about a 30 cent return on the dollar given.  If you give unemployment insurance, you get $1.60 back on the dollar that you put in.  There are multiplier effects that are a reality of our economic laws.  The
Republicans are ignoring them... "
140,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
141,"SEN. KERRY:  ...in order just to feed that upper end.  And, and, and they're willing..."
142,"MR. GREGORY:  But what's the political price, is what I'm asking."
143,SEN. KERRY:  They're willing to hold unemployment compensation hostage to that desire to give a bonus tax cut.
144,"MR. GREGORY:  I understand.  But, but you also heard that there may be a deal on that as well."
145,"SEN. KERRY:  Well, all right, let's say there's a deal."
146,"MR. GREGORY:  And that's, that's just political compromise."
147,"SEN. KERRY:  Here's the problem.  You just had the minority leader sitting here for whatever period of time and all he talked about was the need to come to them.  All he talked about was if they could do something that ""makes us comfortable."" That's not how you compromise.  They need to have a little discomfort, just as we have a little discomfort."
148,MR. GREGORY:  So what does the president do to create that discomfort?
149,"SEN. KERRY:  Well, I think he's..."
150,"MR. GREGORY:  Would you not agree that politically the, the problem for the president has been he has done nothing to make the Republicans uncomfortable."
151,"SEN. KERRY:  Just a minute, David.  Let me, let me take you on, on that. The president of the United States came into office with a president who'd left him with a $5 trillion add-on to the debt of this country, an unprecedented financial crisis.  The fact is that the TARP that we passed that everybody hates--they hate the word, they hate the concept--it saved, it saved countless numbers of jobs in this country.  The Recovery Act saved millions of jobs in this country and brought our financial system back from the brink.  Wall Street ought to be singing this president's praises.  We've had a 60 percent increase in the stock market in two years.  How often does that happen?  You have a $3 trillion increase in the net value of the Fortune 500 companies, $3 trillion increase in two years.  Under George Bush, in eight years, it only
increased by several hundred billion.  You've had the Hire Act, the Republicans opposed it.  It created hundreds of thousands of jobs.  The Recovery Act, the Small Business Act."
152,"MR. GREGORY:  I know that.  But I'm asking you a political question, which is, where do you create the discomfort?  I mean, you, you, you know the game here as a senator."
153,SEN. KERRY:  The president...
154,MR. GREGORY:  You've run for president.
155,"SEN. KERRY:  Right, let me tell you point blank."
156,MR. GREGORY:  You know the pressure points in Washington.
157,"SEN. KERRY:  Here's what the president is doing.  The president is fighting to get unemployment insurance that they have held hostage.  This is the point. People need to focus in America.  The Republicans have been willing to hold unemployment insurance hostage to this bonus tax cut that has the least impact and adds to the deficit.  And the phony recklessness of their position is this, they've said for months, ""We can't give you unemployment compensation because it's unpaid for and it will add to the deficit."" But yesterday they were willing to vote for a $4 trillion increase that wipes out everything the debt commission is doing, in order to give a tax cut to the wealthiest people. Now, the president's prepared to compromise to get unemployment insurance, to get the work for pay tax cut, to get a child care credit tax cut, to get additional tax cuts that go to average people and will create jobs.  But he wants to do more than that, and this is the most important difference between us and them.  The Republican agenda is tax cut and cut spending.  We cannot cut our way to
competition with these other countries.  If we're going to be a great power, if we're going to project in the world, if we're going to put America back to work and be part of the $6 trillion market that is the new energy market of the future with six billion users, we need to invest
in America's future."
158,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
159,"SEN. KERRY:  And the president is fighting to get an infrastructure development effort in America so we regrow our own country.  He's fighting for an energy policy that they fought against all last year and delayed and delayed and delayed, even though we made compromise after compromise.  And I know that because I was negotiating it.  And we need R and D, we need science, technology, engineering, math.  We need to kick America into gear.  This is our Sputnik moment.  We've sort of seen Sputnik going across the sky, but we've done nothing similar to what we did..."
160,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
161,SEN. KERRY:  ...in the 1960s to respond to it.
162,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to get you on a couple of other matters here that are very important.  I want to start with WikiLeaks.  You heard Senator McConnell says this a ""high-tech terrorist."" Secretary Gates, Defense secretary, of course, had a slightly different view of what the fallout
actually is, and this is what he said this week.  And I want to show it. "
163,"(Videotape, Tuesday)"
164,"SEC'Y ROBERT GATES:  Now, I've heard the impact of these releases on our foreign policy described as, as a meltdown, as a, as a game changer and so on. I think, I think those descriptions are fairly significantly overwrought.  The fact is, governments deal with the United States because it's in their interest, not because they like us, not because they trust us, and not because they believe we can keep secrets."
165,(End videotape)
166,MR. GREGORY:  You disagree with that in terms of what the damage done here is?
167,"SEN. KERRY:  I think there, there is damage and maybe a little bit more profound than the secretary.  I don't think it's, goes to the extent that some people have been saying, but, yes, there is real damage.  Social Security numbers of individuals have been made public.  Technology about roadside bombs has been made public.  The relationship of a president, let's say, of Yemen, who is involved with us in helping to fight domestic terror in Yemen has been exposed for parts of his relationship with the United States.  It could be very damaging to our efforts there.  There are many similar kinds of efforts. In Germany, some people are calling
for the return of the ambassador.  In other places, they won't talk to some of our people for a while.  This hurts. This--I, I think this act..."
168,MR. GREGORY:  Will some ambassadors be removed from countries?
169,"SEN. KERRY:  I, I can't tell you, but it's possible that in some places people are going to say they can't work with them."
170,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
171,"SEN. KERRY:  And they'll say that quietly and behind the scenes.  David, you know, I was very much involved back in the days when the Pentagon Papers came out.  This has no relationship to something like that.  This is voyeurism. This is sort of a anarchical kind of act by someone who wants attention that is not revealing some truth about a government lying or a policy that's been misled.  This is just letting people in on the inside of something where it has great ability to undo our ability to protect the interests of our country."
172,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to ask you, finally--this is a bigger topic than we can get into all the details of, but I want to ask you about Afghanistan. The president visiting the troops there this weekend, a surprise visit.  And when we talk about our goals, all of the concerns about Hamid Karzai, the Afghan leader, questions about corruptions and so forth.  And it, and it takes me back to a famous moment before you were senator, April 1971, when you said this on Capitol Hill about Vietnam."
173,"(Videotape, April 22, 1971)"
174,SEN. KERRY:  How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?
175,(End videotape)
176,"MR. GREGORY:  My question to you, as you look at the landscape of our withdrawal plans in 2014, is it a mistake in Afghanistan to think, to ask soldiers to be the last to die in a war that may not be able to achieve the results that we have laid out forth?"
177,"SEN. KERRY:  Well, first of all, I, I just looked at that and I said, ""Boy, he needs a haircut."" But leaving that aside... "
178,"MR. GREGORY:  Right, right."
179,"SEN. KERRY:  ...look, in my judgment, Afghanistan is just not Vietnam. We shouldn't have been in Vietnam.  It was a surrogate war, it was a civil war, it was a Cold War surrogate war.  There were any number of reasons why it was a gigantic mistake.  In Afghanistan, we're there for a
purpose.  Now, I don't believe we need the size of the footprint doing  everything we're doing, and I've said that many times publicly.  And I don't think the president, in the long run, wants to do that, which is why he has committed to this transition. I believe the president and our
military and our policy is on the right track, and that track is to turn this over to the Afghans as rapidly as possible, in a way that meets their needs to have sufficient stability and capacity to survive, and our needs..."
180,MR. GREGORY:  Can you do that by 2014?
181,"SEN. KERRY:  ...and our needs to be able to prosecute counterterrorism efforts.  I think you can do a lot of counterterrorism with a smaller footprint and still manage the, the, the progress of Afghanistan.  And most of that, in my judgment, will depend on what we're succeeding in
doing in Pakistan."
182,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-mm.
183,"SEN. KERRY:  Pakistan is as much the key of the outcome in Afghanistan as anything else.  Now, can we do it by 2014?  Yes, I believe we can.  And I think the president is absolutely intent on preventing this from being the mistake that begged the question that I posed in 1971. "
184,"MR. GREGORY:  We will leave it there.  Senator Kerry, thank you very much, as always."
185,SEN. KERRY:  Thank you.
186,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up next, America's anxiety.  Questions about the economy, terrorism and the direction of the country.  Our roundtable weighs in on our discussion so far, the question of politics and leadership.  From The New York Times, columnists Tom Friedman and David Brooks; Republican strategist, Mike Murphy; and the BBC's Katty Kay."
187,(Announcements)
188,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We are back now with our roundtable.  Joining me now, the BBC's Katty Kay; Republican strategist Mike Murphy; and from The New York Times, columnist Tom Friedman and his colleague, fellow New York Times columnist David Brooks."
189,Welcome to all of you.  So much to get to.
190,"David Brooks, this question of this, this sense of limbo that we're in, in the country.  Are we going to recover from this economy?  Is there another terrorist threat out there?  The fallout from WikiLeaks.  What about the debt? What's going to get done in Washington?  Do we learn
anything in this moment about the prospect for compromise on taxes, just based on what you've heard this morning? "
191,"MR. DAVID BROOKS:  Well, it depends what we believe.  Sixty-five percent of Americans think the country's in decline.  We go through pessimistic phases. I can't remember a pessimistic phase this long.  And to me, the problem is we don't know what we want to be in 50 years.  President Obama talked about building new foundations.  New foundations for what?  And so
that's the big question that's out there.  And I would just say, as the beginning of an answer to it, the one thing the United States has that no other country has is that we're a universal nation.  People come here from all over the world, and we have connections to all over the world. China will never have that.  And that's got to be the basis as we move forward.  Once we have that defined, we'll know where we can compromise, what we can work with, what we can't do. "
192,"MR. GREGORY:  Mike Murphy, this was a cartoon that caught my eye this week. I'll put it on the screen.  You see it there from Weyant's World by Chris Weyant, and it's, it's Obama and Boehner, ""In the spirit of bipartisanship, why don't you take a step toward the middle first?"" Into the chasm.  And yet, on taxes and even the extension of unemployment benefits, it looks like we're seeing the contours of a deal."
193,MR. MIKE MURPHY:  Yeah.  Yes.
194,"MR. GREGORY:  I mean, Mitch McConnell apparently underrates the value of negotiating on MEET THE PRESS, but was signaling that they're close. "
195,"MR. MURPHY:  Yeah.  No, no, that was, that was under McConnell's sunshine sending strategy there.  Something's going to happen.  I think they're going to get START, I think they're going to get the Bush tax cuts, even though we're doing this silly kind of political litigation of it now,
which we just did in the election.  Democrats think the big word is millionaire, Republicans think the big word is jobs.  Republicans will win in that fight.  But something's going to come.  It is in the president's interest to understand that two things happened at the election:  People
want to get something done; and they want the country to move right economically.  So if he will move right economically, something will get done."
196,"MR. GREGORY:  But there's this question--for, for Katty first, and then Tom--about whether we're having the right conversation.  Here is the job growth chart from 2009 to 2010.  I'll put it up on the screen here.  And what you'll see is the, the, the down arrow, in too many cases, lasting for too long.  You see the change in jobs going up last month, but then November, only 39,000 new jobs.  That sense of anxiety, and whether--we're talking about all this austerity in cutting the debt, what about investing in the economy?  Are we having the right conversation?"
197,"MS. KATTY KAY:  And I think that's what exactly is producing anxiety amongst ordinary Americans.  And to get back to David's point that, you know, there is this sense of where the country is going, and I think Americans are thinking, ""Well, if I haven't got a job, and I don't see how we're going to get out of this slump, I'm worried for the first time in generations that I might not be passing on a better country to my children; that my, my children might not be better off, better educated than I am."" And that is tied in with these unemployment numbers, because that's how it's affecting people directly.  And what, what's interesting, I think, to me is looking at the bright spot for America is that you don't have what you've got in Europe, where tens of thousands of people are taking to the streets demanding that the state intervene and give them those jobs or give them those benefits.  And this is the saving
grace for Americans and always has been is that they want to do it themselves.  That you--so it's anxiety, it's not anger at the government that people are feeling.  They want to fix this problem themselves."
198,"MR. GREGORY:  Tom Friedman, you wrote this week a, a column that was so popular, called--you know, about ""Wiki China."" Explain the premise, and why that had such traction in terms of being top of mind in, in what you're thinking about."
199,"MR. TOM FRIEDMAN:  Well, the column was about what if we could read China's cables about us, basically.  And I think what the Chinese would be saying is, is how polarized the Americans are about all the wrong things.  And, and that's really what I think is, is the, is the big story
right now, David.  I think what, what people want to know first of all, from President Obama and our political leaders, where are we going? OK?  If you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there."
200,"So it starts with what world are you in?  Well, I think we're in a flat world where, for the first time, we're competing with two billion more people just like us.  OK.  That's the first reality.  Second reality is, in that kind of world, how do you get rich?  Well, you've got to create
more jobs that make people's lives more productive, more secure, more entertained, more comfortable and more healthy, OK?  And you have to do that with such good infrastructure and such a productive, educated American worker that one American worker can do the job of five or 10 Chinese, and therefore be paid like five or 10 Chinese."
201,"Well, if that's the world you're in, OK, then what do we need?  We need better education, more investment in infrastructure, more immigrants. You can go right down the list.  Well, if that's what you need, then what is the hybrid politics that says, jeez, we've got to cut here so we can invest over here. OK?  We need to raise gas, gas taxes or carbon taxes to get money so we can actually cut payroll taxes and encourage businesses to invest in this country. So I think what people are really looking for is a hybrid politics.  What they're looking for is not two parties, OK, that grudgingly compromise on their ideologies, but actually come
together for a strategic collaboration."
202,"MR. GREGORY:  But that interests me, Mike Murphy, because Matt Bai wrote something in his column in The New York Times this week, and I want to put it up on the screen because I think it gets to something important here in terms of the political calculus."
203,MR. MURPHY:  Mm-hmm.
204,"MR. GREGORY:  He write--writes, ""Mr. Obama has almost invariably sought to position himself halfway between traditionalism and reform, just as his vague notions of `hope' and `change' during the '08 campaign were meant to appeal simultaneously to both disaffected independent voters and core progressives. And in virtually every case, he has satisfied pretty much no one."""
205,So look.  Here's the president...
206,MR. MURPHY:  Right.
207,"MR. GREGORY:  ...he's probably willing to deal on tax cuts because he, he realizes the Republicans have the leverage on that right now."
208,MR. MURPHY:  Right.
209,"MR. GREGORY:  Liberals are going to be very, very unhappy.  They are unhappy about that, they feel like they're caving.  Then you've got this disaffected middle that doesn't necessarily agree with Tom that says, ""Well, government's got to play a big role in investing in some of this
new economy."""
210,"MR. MURPHY:  Well, he's caught because his base has actually become more liberal in the Congress because of many of the losses.  He ought to cut them loose.  They're the losing team.  They just lost an historic election.  The ideology is discredited.  His biggest problem was he campaigned in the center, and he governed from the left.  What he does--what his problem now is he looks weak and he looks secondary to the congressional battle.  He ought to get out in front, he ought to pivot, he ought to have--I think you could create, and Tom kind of implies this, kind of a national interest, economic agenda to link the two because we are in a tremendous economic competition now.  But it does mean a rightward move on things.  And he ought to, frankly, call the Republicans to task on entitlement cutting.  We campaign on it."
211,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
212,"MR. MURPHY:  Make us do it.  That would be good for the country.  It would be politically tough for the Republicans, but he could become the leader again from the center."
213,"MR. GREGORY:  And it is striking to me that the Republicans won't specify painful choices when this is where they say they have the mandate to cut spending, and yet they're still so hesitant to do that."
214,MR. MURPHY:  Well...
215,"MS. KAY:  But, David, maybe nobody will specify painful choices.  The one word that politicians can't say at the moment is that you have to sacrifice. We're living in this age of entitlement where there is an almost messianic attitude to either raising taxes or cutting spending
from both Democrats and Republicans.  Neither side want to give on those. "
216,"MR. BROOKS:  If I, if I..."
217,MS. KAY:  And neither side want to make the tough choices it's going to take.
218,"MR. BROOKS:  There's a two-level conversation going on here.  At the surface level, Katty's absolutely right, that no one is going to step out and say the--make the painful choices.  But inside, in private conversations, they're having a different conversation.  I guarantee you right now, at the White House, they're having serious conversations about tax reform, big tax reform. In the Republican Party, there are Republicans like Paul Ryan who are campaigning within the Republican caucus for serious entitlement reform. There's pushback from the
leadership, obviously."
219,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But look at the disagreement, though."
220,"MR. BROOKS:  So what strikes me is the...(unintelligible)...level of the private conversations, which are more inspiring than what we see."
221,"MR. GREGORY:  So what do we do with that?  I mean, what does it do for the country if we have inspiring private conversations?"
222,MS. KAY:  Right.
223,"MR. BROOKS:  Well, but what..."
224,"MR. MURPHY:  No, no, that's the first step."
225,MR. BROOKS:  ...Mitch McConnell said today was important...
226,MR. MURPHY:  He said...
227,MR. BROOKS:  ...that he was willing to sit down.
228,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
229,MR. BROOKS:  That...
230,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
231,MR. BROOKS:  To willingness--I thought what he said today was actually quite newsworthy.
232,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
233,"MR. BROOKS:  He, he didn't commit himself to too much."
234,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
235,"MR. BROOKS:  But he said he was willing to have a meeting, and you don't say that unless you're willing to put a lot of stuff on the table the Democrats want."
236,MR. GREGORY:  To do something.
237,"MR. MURPHY:  It's very important because it has to start on the inside, and then it has to be forced on the voters, because it's easy to say in a poll you want all this sacrifice.  And most of the time voters look at sacrifice, they grab the person suggesting it and they throw them in the political wood chipper."
238,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
239,"MR. MURPHY:  Voters do not reward sacrifice.  Politicians are very tuned into voters.  Look at the deficit commission vote.  The, the retired politicians were 5-to-1 for it.  The active politicians were split 50-50, on a bipartisan basis, to the credit to some Democrats."
240,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  I think, David..."
241,"MR. MURPHY:  So this is where it begins inside, and it, it is a hopeful sign."
242,MR. GREGORY:  Tom.
243,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  I think, you know, you were saying that this 40 percent in the middle, or, or Mike was saying that, I'm not sure who said--that they're against what's going on.  I disagree.  I think they will be for it if they think the president has a plan to make America great again."
244,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
245,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  If they don't think he has a plan for that, but he's just doing health care, they're going to say I don't want to spend a dime. What we're looking for is something big.  We're doing things that are small and easy when we need to be doing things that are big and hard."
246,MR. GREGORY:  And a big move by--excuse me.
247,"MS. KAY:  And it's been possible.  It was possible in '92.  You had Ross Perot come in.  He campaigned on a platform of reducing the deficit, and he got votes on it.  He gave Bill Clinton the political cover to do it. But there was a very big difference.  In '92, interest rates were at 8 percent, so American voters were feeling the pain directly.  Anyone with a car payment, a mortgage, was feeling the pain of the deficit."
248,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
249,MS. KAY:  They're not feeling it today.
250,MR. GREGORY:  Let me take a quick break here.
251,MS. KAY:  It's an abstract concept.
252,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to come back, continue this, but also talk about some of the political leadership questions.  Who leads us out of this sense of anxiety?  More from our roundtable right after this break."
253,(Announcements)
254,MR. GREGORY:  We're back.  More from our roundtable.  This sense of America's anxiety and who leads us out of this.
255,"David Brooks, I want to put this back on the screen because I think it's instructive in terms of where the president rates in his approval compared to Reagan and Clinton, November '82 and '94, they both suffered big midterm defeats.  We know how that story played out in terms of
second terms.  Is the conventional wisdom wrong here, that somehow Obama's vulnerable and he's weakened?  Is he, in fact, after all the beatings he's taken, potentially stronger politically?"
256,MR. BROOKS:  The conventional wisdom is never wrong.
257,MR. GREGORY:  Never wrong.  Right.  Yes.
258,"MR. BROOKS:  No.  He's weaker than those guys because the economy is not Reagan's economy, it's not Clinton's economy.  And he's good nationally, but we don't win elections nationally.  We run in Ohio and Indiana and North Carolina and places like that..."
259,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
260,"MR. BROOKS:  ...and he's extremely weak there.  And then the important thing that happened this week is the collapse of liberal morale.  A lot of liberals have said he's just not strong, he's not fighting.  And he, you know, Brother Murphy, as much as I love you, but he can't just leave those guys as the losing team.  He's a Democrat."
261,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
262,"MR. BROOKS:  He's got to rally those guys and win back the Senate.  I think he's strong, he's a great politician, he'll be back.  But I, I think the troubles have been mounting on the left and the center for him."
263,"MR. GREGORY:  The issue is, and I've tried to raise this with Senator Kerry, I'm not sure I got, you know, a very clear answer on this, which is politically, what does the president do to make life hard for Republicans? Because they, I mean, I've talked to Republicans who say
he's making it very easy for us to say no."
264,"MR. MURPHY:  The meanest thing you can do in politics is steal the other guy's act.  Bill Clinton was a master at it.  He ought to go to that playbook and learn.  I think he is in more trouble for those structural reasons, but more trouble also means more opportunity.  He needs to make
big moves, he needs to move ideologically.  He's never going to get the left back.  He's broken their hearts.  And they are the losing team in numbers.  So yeah, he can't completely cut them off, but he can't do what he did for the last two years, which is let them drive.  He needs to be the--he needs to run against all of them and create this agenda of economic nationalism with a conservative tilt.  He's got to move or we're going to keep relitigating this stuff.  The Democrats are silly to keep doing this millionaire thing."
265,MR. GREGORY:  Hm.
266,"MR. MURPHY:  It's been beaten to death, it's a loser."
267,"MR. GREGORY:  Ah, ah, ah..."
268,"MR. MURPHY:  We keep winning that way.  Now, it--I'm a, I'm a partisan Republican.  I'm happy to keep winning."
269,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
270,"MR. MURPHY:  Wait two years, get a Republican president and run the table, which we have a good shot, now, of doing."
271,MR. GREGORY:  But what's the theory of the case for a Republican?
272,MR. MURPHY:  Right now?
273,"MR. GREGORY:  To win, yeah."
274,MR. MURPHY:  We can run the economy.
275,MR. GREGORY:  That's it?
276,"MR. MURPHY:  We win that, we win the election."
277,"MR. GREGORY:  I want, I want to come back to some of the presidential stuff. "
278,"Tom Friedman, I want to show the cover of The Weekly Standard this week on this WikiLeaks fallout.  It's Hillary Clinton on the, the cover with a number of phones to her ears, trying to mitigate the damage here.  What have we learned and what really hurts about all this?"
279,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  Well, I think the thing that we've learned the most, David, is how we're, we're leaking power.  You know, that, that's my view of it. We're--what do we do?  We're begging the Saudis to not have their private donors fund al-Qaeda.  OK?  So what do we do, we borrow money from China.  We cycle it through our cars, send it to Saudi Arabia.  They send it to the Taliban, their private individuals, and then our soldiers go over and try to kill them.  We're begging China, ""Please, China, North Korea wants to send ballistic missile parts to Iran through Beijing Airport, could you not do that?"" No, can't do that either.  So why are we in this situation, David? Because basically we were hooked on oil.  We're addicted to oil, and we're addicted to credit.  And there's a fundamental law, OK, of geo politics. Addicts never tell the truth to their pushers. China is our credit pusher, Saudi Arabia is our oil pusher, and we cannot
have a frank conversation with them because we are in their debt."
280,MS. KAY:  Yeah.
281,"MR. BROOKS:  Can I, can I--I rarely disagree with either of these guys, but let me disagree with you, Tom, on this one.  You know what... "
282,"MR. GREGORY:  Theres extra points, by the way, for Freeman--Friedman. Friedman."
283,"MR. BROOKS:  When, when Jimmy Carter was president, did he snap his fingers and the country do what he wanted?  When Bill Clinton--I covered those summits in the '90s, we did not snap our fingers.  When Ronald Reagan was trying to place missiles in Europe, didn't snap his fingers.
Harry Truman, we were the height of our power, we couldn't tell China what to do.  China attacked us in North, in Korea.  So, you know, I'm not sure--I, I think what it shows--I'm not sure we're leaking power."
284,MR. FRIEDMAN:  Mm-hmm.
285,"MR. BROOKS:  We've got the problems that you've described.  But the other thing it shows is there's no secret conspiracy, that the stuff that's going on inside, which these cables reveal, is the stuff that we, as journalists, reveal ever day.  And the people who think there's some
hidden secret conspiracy in government, that's just not true."
286,"MR. GREGORY:  But what about the fallout?  I mean, does this really hurt America?"
287,"MS. KAY:  I think it hurts, the fact that there are not back channels and, perhaps, people who had been willing to share information with American diplomats are going to be less willing to do so.  We've already seen a senior German official resign because he had--was named in the
WikiLeak cables as sharing information and being useful to American diplomats.  We have a Canadian ambassador also might be resigning for the same basis.  I think having people around the world who are now thinking twice about whether they're going to have private conversations with American diplomats doesn't help Americans."
288,"I agree with Tom.  I think that the WikiLeaks shows that this is a super power whose powers are not so super anymore.  And when it comes to--we had a period, after the end of the Cold War, where America was the only big guy on the block and where you could get other countries to do what you wanted in very big questions, and you haven't got that now.  With
China, North Korea, Russia, even.  We're having to do deals with Moscow to get what we want there, and we're not always getting it when it comes to Iran.  So..."
289,MR. GREGORY:  It was...
290,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  Ill get to David, which is that that was a bipolar world.  The reason we couldn't do a lot of it because there was a Soviet Union on the other side."
291,"MS. KAY:  But post, post the end of the Soviet..."
292,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  That Soviet Union has collapsed now, and we should actually have more leverage."
293,"MS. KAY:  And we were the, we were the big guy."
294,MR. MURPHY:  A lot of these countries have a cynical strategy of abdicating any responsibility because Big Brother America will do it.
295,MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yes.  Absolutely.
296,"MR. MURPHY:  The Middle East is a great example.  In the private room, go clean up every problem we have."
297,MR. FRIEDMAN:  Absolutely.
298,MR. MURPHY:  And meanwhile we cash in on oil.
299,MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yeah.
300,"MR. MURPHY:  I think the problem with the WikiLeaks things, and I think Senator Kerry was right about that, it, there was no ideologist reason for it, no argument.  It was pure destruction.  It was a huge monkey wrench into the machinery of American diplomacy.  I feel sorry more than anybody in the country right now for the U.S. ambassador in France, because you know the French foreign minister he's going to play that stuff to the max.  And in a thousand small little negotiations..."
301,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
302,MR. MURPHY:  ...our team now is playing with a sandbag tied around it...
303,MS. KAY:  It makes the job harder.
304,MR. MURPHY:  ...which is bad for America.  This was an act of treason.
305,"MR. GREGORY:  And to that point, the politics of this, and I want to, I want to touch on some of how this is used and, and more broadly.  It was interesting, as, as we think about the theory of the case for the right and who some of the players are on the right, Romney was out this week on Jay Leno.  Sarah Palin continues to be out there in big form with her book.  And my colleague, Joe Scarborough, wrote this in Politico, that I thought was interesting in terms of how the right is dealing with Sarah Palin. ""Republicans have a problem,"" he wrote.  ""The most-talked-about figure in the GOP is a reality show star who cannot be elected.  And yet
the same leaders who fret that Sarah Palin could devastate their party in 2012 are too scared to say in public what they all complain about in private."
306,"Enough.  It's time for the GOP to man up."""
307,MR. FRIEDMAN:  Mm-hmm. 
308,"MR. GREGORY:  And my question is, what impact does she have whether she runs or doesn't run?  Because she's a force."
309,"MR. MURPHY:  Yeah, a huge force, though a huge force now.  You know, we're 14 months away, even though that sounds painfully close, to when the caucuses and primaries may begin.  I think--you know, I started--I've been a critic all along.  It started on this show at the Republican convention saying I thought she was a bad strategic choice because she's a poison pill in the general election, wipe us out, I believe.  But in the Republican primaries, particularly in the movement conservative silo, which generally will win the Iowa caucus and therefore get a lot of momentum, she's very, very powerful, if she runs.  So I think she'll have a half life, but she's going to be a terrifically powerful force, in some ways for good.  She's kind of a polemicist and everything.  But as a candidate, she'd be a disaster."
310,MR. GREGORY:  I've...
311,MR. MURPHY:  And we'll see if other Republicans start to take that position quietly.  A lot of them do.
312,"MR. GREGORY:  I've got a minute left.  Tom Friedman, the president, we saw, I think we have some of the pictures of the president, a surprise trip to Afghanistan in the holiday season to buck up the troops.  But it's also coming at a time when we have a review that's under way of our Afghanistan policy. You heard Senator Kerry say he thinks the footprint can get a lot smaller. Where are we on Afghanistan, and how fraught do you think this review process will be?"
313,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  To me, David, the first rule of Middle East politics is the Middle East only puts a smile on your face when it starts with them. OK? When they want it more than we do, whether it was Camp David or the Oslo peace agreement.  And you read the WikiLeaks, basically, and it's all about, ""Who's going to pay me which, you know, amount of money and, which, rubles or dinars or dollars, to do what you want."" So we are basically paying our Afghan and Pakistani partners to be two-faced because if we didn't pay them to be two-faced, they would be one-faced and all against us.  That's not a winning hand."
314,MR. GREGORY:  And that's...
315,MR. FRIEDMAN:  That's the hand we're holding.
316,MR. GREGORY:  That's what we're up against right now.
317,"All right, we're going to, we're going to have to leave it there.  But thank you all very much."
318,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Before we go, a quick programming note.  Be sure to join us next week.  I'll have an exclusive interview with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg on leadership and politics and where we go. "
319,"That is all for today.  We'll be back next week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

MR. DAVID GREGORY:
This Sunday, the tax 
fight
. The president gets some powerful 
support
 for his deal with 
Republicans
, but 
liberal Democrats
 are in revolt, unmoved by the president's rationale for 
compromise
.

PRES. BARACK OBAMA:
I think it's tempting not to negotiate with hostage takers, unless the hostage gets harmed. Then people will question the wisdom of that strategy. In this case, the hostage was the 
American people
.
"

"

MR. GREGORY:
Will the deal pass 
Congress
? And what will it do to create jobs? We'll ask our lead news-maker guest, the chairman of the 
White House Council of Economic Advisers
, 
Austan Goolsbee
. Then, the politics of the center. If 
Washington
 is broken, is the answer an independent? 
Independent
 mayor of 
New York City Michael Bloomberg
 joins me exclusively to discuss the 
economy
, the president's leadership, and his own 
political
 future. Finally, our 
political
 roundtable on the president's course correction after the midterms. What does the tax deal say about the prospects for bipartisanship over the next two years? With us: Democratic congressman from

"

Announcer:
From 
NBC News
 in 
Washington
, 
MEET THE PRESS
 with 
David Gregory
.
"
7,"
MR. GREGORY:
Good morning. Back in September, 
Austan Goolsbee
 was appointed chairman of the president's 
Council of Economic Advisers
, the two-person agency charged with providing the president with objective 
economic
 advice to help shape his policies both at home and abroad. Along with Treasury Secretary 
Tim Geithner
, 
Goolsbee
 is part of the group that delivers a daily 
economic
 briefing to the president. He's been part of the president's inner circle and one of his closest advisers since the two met when 
Obama
 was running for the 
Senate
 in 
2004
. 
Goolsbee
 is now front and center in the administration's attempts to achieve 
agreement
 in 
Congress
 on this 
tax cut
 deal before they go 
home for the holidays
. Mr. 
Goolsbee
, welcome to 
MEET THE PRESS
.
"
8,"
MR. AUSTAN GOOLSBEE:
Thanks for having me, 
David
.
"
9,"
MR. GREGORY:
And let's start there. You going to get a deal? Is this going to pass through 
Congress
 before 
Christmas
?
"
10,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
I certainly hope it does. I mean, the -- what the president got in the 
package
 is very important for the 
economy
. And to see 150, 200 million people and their families have their 
taxes
 go up in less than three weeks I think would be a serious blow. So I, I think everybody should take a step back if they -- I 
understand
 the feeling that it's a 
bitter pill
 to swallow, the 
high income
tax cuts
. But what the president was able to get that is substantially bigger than that and important for the 
economy
, whether it's incentives for investment for firms, whether it's a payroll 
tax cut
 for 155 million workers, 
money
 for 
college education
, etc., it's really important and we can't let that go away.
"
11,"
MR. GREGORY:
You're predicting passage, though?
"
12,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
I, I'm predicting passage.
"
13,"
MR. GREGORY:

Let's talk
 about the rationale for this deal. This week the president's 
economic
 adviser, 
Larry Summers
, warned of the consequences of inaction here in a briefing. I'll put part of what he said up on the screen. ""Failure to pass this bill,"" 
Summers
 said, ""in the next couple weeks would materially increase the risk that the 
economy
 would stall out and we would have a double-dip [
recession
]."" Now, for months this administration, the president's 
economic
 advisers, have been downplaying, dismissing the idea of a double-dip 
recession
. And yet here, when it comes to building 
political
support
 for this tax deal, suddenly this is the, the fear. Is this a scare tactic?
"
14,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
Well, look. I, I think that takes 
Larry
's comment a 
little
 out of context. I think all private forecasters 
agree
 that -- when they saw this 
package
 announced, you saw them 
step forward
 and say that it would significantly raise the 
growth rate
 of the 
United States
 in the coming year if we were to pass it and get the 
unemployment rate
 down and jobs created more than they thought before that. And if you let these 
tax cuts
 expire, which they will in 20 days if we do nothing, I think that would be a serious blow to the 
economy
. Everybody agrees on that. So I, I don't think we should get into the semantics of whether it's what -- how much it raises the probability of 
double dip
. I think we should just recognize not acting is very bad for the 
economy
, and acting would be good for the 
economy
. That's why we should do it.
"
15,"
MR. GREGORY:
What about the effect on jobs? Because that's what matters here, right, whether the 
unemployment rate
 is going to come down. 
Ron Brownstein
, in his column in the 
National Journal
, is critical of that 
prospect
 of stimulus. This is, again, part of what he wrote
"
16,"
this week:
""It further entrenches,"" this deal, ""
the Bush
tax cuts
, even though the 
median income
 and the number of 
Americans
 with jobs are lower today than when the 
tax cuts
 were originally
"
17,"
signed in 
2001
 ."" What evidence is there that this kind of tax cutting is actually going to get people back to work?
"
18,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
OK, wait. Be, be a 
little
 careful with that because the context before the president came out with this deal was a bit the cycle of dysfunction, in which 
Democrats
 are putting forward reasonable ideas like a three-month 
extension
 of unemployment -- defeated; extending the 
middle class
 part of the 
Bush tax cuts
 -- defeated. 
The Republicans
 are also arguing about the 
Bush tax cuts
. What the president was able to do in this negotiation was expand the board beyond just the 
Bush tax cuts
. The important stuff in this, in addition to preserving the 
tax cuts
 for the 
middle class
, are the 
Obama
tax cuts
. So you've got incentives for education, a new payroll 
tax cut
 for 155 million workers, the 
earned income tax credit
, investment incentives that are new. These are things which I think help the 
economy
. And all I would say to Mr. 
Brownstein
, who I respect a great deal, is that when they announced this 
package
 -- it's not often that 
Washington
 announces something that leads the private 
economic
 forecasters to come out and say, ""We believe the 
GDP growth
 rate will be one point higher."" But that's what they did.
"
19,"
MR. GREGORY:
But I'm asking about the president's 
economic philosophy
. But, Mr. 
Goolsbee
, this is the tough question.
"
20,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
Yes.
"
21,"
MR. GREGORY:
The president and his 
economic
 team said in the first stimulus that the 
tax cut
 provisions there were the least stimulative part of the 
package
. Now I'm asking whether or not you believe there's a change in philosophy here, that in fact 
tax cuts
 are going to put people back to work and stimulate the 
economy
.
"
22,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
Well, the, the question is tax -- which 
tax cuts
? I don't believe, the president doesn't believe, that the 
high income
tax cuts
 work, period. I don't think the evidence supports that. And, as I say, that's a 
bitter pill
 to have to deal with. But it's a 
compromise
. And by giving that one piece, we were able to get a series of things that I think make a big difference to the 
middle class
 and to 
working families
.
"
23,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, but what about 
2012
? This is a two-year 
extension
. The president said, ""Look, you know, we're going to wait till 
2012
, make the case that these upper -- the 
tax cuts
 on the upper earners, that they don't make 
economic
 sense."" What makes him think that he can make a better case in 
2012
? You really think in an 
election
 year you're not going to see a vote in 
Congress
 to extend these?
"
24,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
Well, I think the, the only argument that's being put forward by the 
Republicans
 of why to extend them are, as you come out of the deepest 
recession
 since 
1929
, we shouldn't affect anybody's 
taxes
. In 
2012
 that's not going to be the circumstance. In 
2012
, I believe they will have to stand up and defend on their own merits that they think these 
high income
tax cuts
 work, and they will not be able to do that because they don't. But the point was, by giving on this one issue, the president got more than twice as much than the size of those for his priorities that are going to help us grow our way out of this.
"
25,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, we're -- 
let's talk
 about the broader context here. We're talking about a jobs crisis, we're also talking about a debt crisis. This is what Treasury Secretary 
Geithner
 said back in August about a temporary 
extension
 of the 
tax cut
 for 
wealthiest Americans
 in the 
country
. This is what he said.
"
26,"

"
27,"
SEC'Y TIMOTHY GEITHNER:
The 
world
 is likely to view any temporary 
extension
 of the 
income
tax cuts
 for the top two percent as a prelude to a long-term or permanent 
extension
, and that would hurt 
economic
 recovery as well by undermining confidence that we're prepared to make a commitment today to bring down our future deficits.
"
28,"

"
29,"
MR. GREGORY:
Now, you've got a 
compromise
 here, but isn't the secretary's warning already coming true? Eighty hours after the president says the debt 
commission
 did great work to slash the 
deficit
, within 80 hours he's announcing this 
compromise
 deal that adds a trillion 
dollars
 to the 
deficit
; and a two-year 
extension
 to 
2012
, when the prospects of reversing these is really very difficult to imagine, in an 
election
 year, that 
Congress
 wouldn't extend the 
tax cuts
 further.
"
30,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
Well, you got a couple questions embodied in that question. The first, on the adding to the 
deficit
, it's -- the majority of that 
money
 is preventing 
taxes
 from rising in this 
recession
. There's -- that's $500-plus billion of the total. There's $350 billion of new 
tax cuts
 that are on the 
Obama
 program. So I think it's, it's a 
little
 bit different. I 
agree
 that that is the downside. The president doesn't 
support
 -- if we were voting just on extending the 
high income
tax cuts
 on their own, we would be 100 percent against it. The -- they don't work, and we've all been publicly stating for many -- for a long time that they don't. But by trading that, we were able to get things that really matter for the 
economy
. And...
"
31,"
MR. GREGORY:
But how can you show you're serious about long-term efforts to bring down the debt?
"
32,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
OK, then that's the second part of your question, and what I would emphasize there is the, the 
Bowles-Simpson
 fiscal 
commission
 and other fiscal commissions highlight that it's medium and long-run fiscal consolidation and responsibility which is their goal. You cannot reduce the 
deficit
 if the 
economy
 is not growing. Period. They each have made clear that the short-run 
growth
 of the 
economy
 -- we, we should not be conflating medium- run 
deficit
 reduction with short-run getting out of 
recession
 and getting ourselves growing.
"
33,"
MR. GREGORY:
That's not a distinction Secretary 
Geithner
 made in August.
"
34,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
Well, I, I, I don't know that that's true. Secretary 
Geithner
 has made that distinction many times.
"
35,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, the, the language is plain, which is that if you extend them temporarily, which was done...
"
36,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
Well, I don't what is said just before and just after that.
"
37,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, but his language says -- I didn't take it out of context.
"
38,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
We have said...
"
39,"
MR. GREGORY:
The language is plain.
"
40,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
...""Do not, do not make these 
high income
tax cuts
 permanent. We cannot afford to do that. It would be a mistake."" I 
agree
 there is some risk. But we are going to 
fight
 that; and, as I say, in 
2012
 we will have been growing out way out of this and those 
tax cuts
 will have to stand on their own merits, which they cannot. In the meantime, by making that two- year trade, we got things on the 
Obama
 priority list, twice as much as what's in those 
high income
tax cuts
, that are fundamentally important for the 
growth
 of the 
economy
.
"
41,"
MR. GREGORY:
But, Mr. 
Goolsbee
, is it a fundamental flaw that this 
compromise
 did not accompany long-term solutions to deal with the debt?
"
42,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
I, I don't know that we could sort out the entire long-run solutions to the debt in the 20 days that remain before hundreds of millions of 
Americans
 are about to see their 
taxes
 go up. The president created the fiscal 
commission
, believes that the medium and long- run fiscal consolidation that's required in the 
country
 is critically important. But we've got to sort that out in a way that is distinct from getting the 
economy
 growing, which is what we're going to do with this 
package
.
"
43,"
MR. GREGORY:
Be -- after two years, when you hit that two-year mark of the 
extension
, do you 
agree
 with 
Peter Orszag
, who was the 
budget
 director for the president, that 
tax cuts
 for wealthy 
Americans
, even for the middle-class, are simply unaffordable?
"
44,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
Well, I absolutely 
agree
 that the 700 billion that you've got to borrow to, to pay for the 
high income
tax cuts
 is a mistake because that doesn't work. Now I -- the president has called for extending the middle-class part of the 
tax cuts
 permanently, and I don't think you can try to balance the 
budget
 just on the backs of the 
middle class
. That will not work.
"
45,"
MR. GREGORY:
But can we afford even middle-class 
tax cuts
?
"
46,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
We can...
"
47,"
MR. GREGORY:

Peter Orszag
 said we can't.
"
48,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
It depends what other actions you take. It's clear that the medium and long- run fiscal challenges facing the 
country
 have to do with the rise of entitlement spending, they have to do with the longer run imbalances that we've created in the structure of the system. It -- you can't just choose one thing and say, ""Can you afford this one piece?"" unless you're looking at the whole 
package
. That's why the president set up the 
commission
.
"
49,"
MR. GREGORY:
Final question, quickly. When do you think we'll see a meaningful reduction in the 
unemployment rate
?
"
50,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
Well, as you know, the 
unemployment rate
 in influenced, not just by how many jobs are created, but also by people coming in from the out-of-the-labor-force status. There's an official forecast and -- that the 
government
 puts out and we update it every six months, it's been a 
little
 better so far this year than it was forecast to be in February, but it's not nearly enough. Having 
private sector
 job 
growth
 for 11 months and adding 1.2 million jobs is a good start, but we've got to do much more. This tax deal, according to private forecasters, goes a long way to up the 
growth rate
. That's why the president's for it. That's why he insisted to try to get these things in it.
"
51,"
MR. GREGORY:
And it'll bring down unemployment in your view?
"
52,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
I think it will, but it's -- look, deepest hole since 
1929
, it takes a while to get out of that, there's no question.
"
53,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, we'll leave it there. Mr. 
Goolsbee
, 
thank you very much
.
"
54,"
MR. GOOLSBEE:
Thank you for having me, 
David
.
"
55,"
MR. GREGORY:
And coming up next, the politics of the center. 
Independent
 mayor of 
New York City
, 
Michael Bloomberg
, joins me exclusively to discuss the 
economy
, 
Washington
, and his own 
political
 future. Then it's our 
political
 roundtable on bipartisanship and the 
state
 of the
"
56,"
president's relationship with his liberal base:
Democratic Congressman 
Anthony Weiner
; former congressman, Democrat, 
Harold Ford
; 
The Wall Street Journal
's 
Paul Gigot
; and 
NBC
's 
Savannah Guthrie
.
"
57,"

"
58,"
MR. GREGORY:
Coming next, my exclusive interview with independent 
New York City mayor
Michael Bloomberg
. If 
Washington
 is broken, could an 
independent candidate
 be the answer? Right after this brief commercial beak.
"
59,"

"
60,"
MR. GREGORY:
We are back, joined now by the mayor of 
New York City
, 
Michael Bloomberg
. Welcome back. Always nice to have you.
"
61,"
MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG:
Thank you for having me.
"
62,"
MR. GREGORY:
You have heard the administration make its case on the issue of 
tax cuts
. I want to ask you, last time you were here you were in favor of a temporary 
extension
 of the 
tax cuts
, 
middle class
, wealthier earners. But you felt it had to be pegged to some long-term solutions as well, which is not the case in this 
compromise
. Are you disappointed with what's been accomplished?
"
63,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
No, I think you should be encouraged because at least the -- both sides of the aisle and both ends of 
Pennsylvania Avenue
 have finally come together to do something in a bipartisan way. 
And I
'm sure the president would have liked other things, but the 
real world
 of governing is to do what is possible, and everybody getting something, nobody getting 100 percent of what they want. So I think -- I view this as the first step. And incidentally, the president did get some of the things he 
wanted
 -- an 
extension
 of some 
tax cuts
 that he was in favor of for business, and an 
extension
 of benefits for the unemployed.
"
64,"
MR. GREGORY:
What about the debt? I mean, here we were -- last week the president was talking about the debt, the 
Debt Commission
's findings. Within 80 hours he is championing an 
agreement
 that adds a trillion 
dollars
 to the debt.
"
65,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
Well, the 
bottom line
 is, unless he does this, he's not going to get a chance to do the next step. You know, the president has got to get some of the other 
party
 to go along with him, and he's got to keep his own 
party
 in line. 
That's what
 leadership is all about. And you can't sit there and say, ""I'm going to do everything at once,"" you'll never get anything done. He's made a step, he's opened the door, and I think now it's incumbent on him to keep working together with the 
Republicans
 and the 
Democrats
. And the next thing is going to be a lot tougher, as you point out. It's easy to reduce 
taxes
, very hard to reduce expenses.
"
66,"
MR. GREGORY:
But is there a concern that when, really, people look at this, this is a two-year 
extension
...
"
67,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
Yeah.
"
68,"
MR. GREGORY:
...
2012
, hard to believe any politician's not going to vote in an 
election
 year to extend 
tax cuts
. Does it send a signal that we're not serious about tackling the long-term debt picture?
"
69,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
I don't -- no, I don't think it does that. I think we are not serious about attacking the long-term debt problem, and that's one of the things that he's going to have to find a way to get on the agenda. You saw -- you have this 
commission
, well-run 
commission
, some 
smart people
, they come up with some ideas, and then 
Congress
 doesn't even want to consider them. That's disappointing. 
On the other hand
, eventually they're going to have to face some of these issues because some -- the Chinese are going to stop buying our debt, we're going to get to the point where business has so 
little
 confidence they're not willing to expand. There's a lot of problems facing us down the road. Some of these trust funds, like 
Social Security
, running out of 
money
. 
Medicaid
 and 
Medicare
 just 
taking over
 the whole 
economy
. So, whether you 
like it or not
, there's going to be a point where you have to stop kicking the can down the road. And this president is, his job is, to some extent, to explain to the public why that's the case. It's going to require shared sacrifice. Never easy to get sacrifice, but that's what leadership's all about.
"
70,"
MR. GREGORY:
What about the impact on jobs? Do you believe the 
tax cuts
 have an actual stimulative effect on the 
economy
?
"
71,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
I don't think there's any question that they put more people -- more 
money
 in people's hands, and I think that the public will do a better job with more 
money
 in their hands to stimulate the 
economy
 than you will do with 
government
 programs.
"
72,"
MR. GREGORY:
But, Mayor, economists say, especially wealthier 
Americans
 don't end up necessarily spending 
money
 that they, that they keep through 
tax cuts
. And look at the effect of the 
Bush tax cuts
 over a decade.
"
73,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:

Well...

"
74,"
MR. GREGORY:
...what some have called a decade of, of futility, if you look at the number of jobs created.
"
75,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
OK. But number one, some of these things are not connected, they just happen to have at same -- happened at the same time. 
And I
 think the more 
money
 you put in people's hands, the more they will spend. And if they don't spend it, they invest it. And investing it is another way of creating jobs. It puts 
money
 into 
mutual funds
 or other kinds of banks that can go out and make loans, and we need to do that.
"
76,"
MR. GREGORY:
What about the president's leadership? You've had some observations about him, one of them in, in an interview with 
GQ
, a portion of which I'll put up on the screen. You said, ""The president, I think, needs some better advisers. He campaigns, 'I'm going to do A,' then he doesn't do it. Now he's pissed off the supporters and the opponents. You go for it."" Does his 
agreement
 on this deal signal to you that he's going in a different direction?
"
77,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
No. I think he signals that he's going for it.
"
78,"
MR. GREGORY:
He is going for it?
"
79,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
Because -- he's got -- yeah, because he can't just sit there and depend on ideology. His job is to lead, and, and leadership is about doing the possible, not sitting around and waiting for the perfect. You know, I start with the assumption that -- or with, with the belief that this president has to succeed. We all have an enormous amount of capital invested in his success. His success is the 
country
's success. And whether you like him or not, whether you voted for him or not, if you want to vote for somebody else, you'll have that opportunity in two years. But right now we should all pull together -- 
Republicans
 and 
Democrats
, both sides of the aisle, the public as well as the elected officials -- and make sure that this president's successful.
"
80,"
MR. GREGORY:
How does he deal with an angry liberal base?
"
81,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
He says, ""Look, this is what I did. This is the best I can do. Suck it up and let's get on together. We have a lot of other things that we can do together. This is not the only tough vote, this is not the only issue. And whether you're a liberal or a conservative, there are lots of other things that you probably feel the 
country
 should be doing and can do.""
"
82,"
MR. GREGORY:
The big question is whether our nation's leaders are making the tough choices, whether they're making the sacrifices to really make progress. You spoke about that this week in 
New York
 about the gridlock in our politics.
"
83,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
Yes.
"
84,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me play a portion of that.
"
85,"

"
86,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
As families struggle to get by, they have seen 
little
 but partisan gridlock, 
political
 pandering and legislative influence peddling, finger-pointing, blame games, and endless attacks. Put simply, when it comes to creating jobs, 
government
 hasn't gotten the job done.
"
87,"

"
88,"
MR. GREGORY:
And to follow up on that, do you think we have the balance right between investment in the 
economy
, innovation in our 
economy
, and the kind of austerity that you've just been talking about that is necessary to make tough choices about how much we're spending?
"
89,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
No, no, I don't. I don't think that we're focusing on innovation. If you go back and look at history, back in like -- I think it was like 
1816
 or something like that, 
DeWitt Clinton
 built the 
Eric Canal
. It opened the whole 
Midwest
. During the 
Lincoln
 presidency, the 
Civil War
, transcontinental railway opened the whole 
country
 up. 
Henry Ford
, about 
1900
, 
1905
, 
all of a sudden
 created factories and processes that could employ and awful lot of people. You go 
World War II
, 
World War II
 did help the 
economy
 a 
little
 bit, but the great thing that came out of 
World War II
 was the 
GI bill
. 
For the first time
, the average person could go to college and have the skills to do it. And you go right on, whether it was microchips or lasers or cell phones, the 
Internet
, each of these things is innovative things that have created new industries, and we are not putting the kind of 
money
 into basic research that we used to do, so that I don't know where the next thing is coming from. And what's really worrisome is, because of our 
immigration policy
, the next great thing might be invented or developed elsewheres, not in our 
country
.
"
90,"
MR. GREGORY:
But so that raises the question of -- 
Larry Summers
 suggested this, this week -- which is the best thing you can do for 
economic
 recovery is make sure you achieve rapid 
economic
 recovery before you get to the business of slashing the 
deficit
. And yet that doesn't seem to be where the politics is moving in 
Washington
 or, or even the voice of the electorate in midterms.
"
91,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
No, no, it isn't. But 
on the other hand
, I don't believe that you need big stimulus things to get the 
economy
 going. I think there's some things that don't cost very much 
money
 but would have a much greater impact. Number one, you've got to build confidence. If you 
think about it
, banks have 
money
 but they're unwilling to make loans. Companies have 
money
. I think we're at a record amount of cash. There was an article in the paper the other day in companies, 
bank accounts
 that they are unwilling to spend on plant and new employees. We've got to make sure that people 
understand
 that this 
country
 is going to pull together. It's confidence more than anything else. If people have confidence, the, the consumer will start spending 
money
. And it's the biggest single impediment to 
growth
.
"
92,"
MR. GREGORY:
What about tough choices? As you look at this landscape of spending, entitlements, other parts of the 
budget
, immigration, what is a tough choice that you would 
support
Washington
 making now that moves the 
country
 forward?
"
93,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
First thing is open the doors to those with the skills we need from around the 
world
. I think the whole issue of what you do with 11 million undocumented, I feel very strongly we should give them a path to citizenship. But, regardless, the whole issue of 
family reunification
, it's a compassion thing, 
understand
 that, but we cannot let those two issues, which are controversial and will take some time to work out, get in the way of right away starting to make sure anybody that gets a graduate degree in 
America
 from overseas gets a green card attached to their diploma. That's the ways that we are going to keep going. You know, all these other countries are trying to attract 
the best and the brightest
, and we're helping them. It's 
even worse
, we're educating them and then helping them. This is craziness. I call it 
national
 suicide. We have to go and, and get the immigrants here. So the first thing I would do is that, and that doesn't cost any 
money
.
"
94,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me spend a couple minutes talking about politics. There was the cover of...
"
95,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
I'm shocked. I didn't think it would come up.
"
96,"
MR. GREGORY:
Shocked we would get to that.
"
97,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
Yeah.
"
98,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me show you the cover of the 
New York Post
 this week about your speech. 
State of the Union
. ""Presidential"" in quotes, ""Mike reads riot act to 
DC
.""
"
99,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
Good picture.
"
100,"
MR. GREGORY:
Do you think an independent can be president?
"
101,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
I don't know. I'm not going to run for president, for the, the job. I've got a great job. I'm going to finish out my 1,100 and whatever number of days it is left to go, and I'll leave the politics to the experts.
"
102,"
MR. GREGORY:
Do you think that it's possible to scrap the two 
party system
? Would you be in favor of that?
"
103,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
Well, the original 
Founding Fathers
 didn't seem to have an interest in 
party politics
, and I've worked very hard in 
New York
 for nonpartisan elections. I'm going to give a speech at an organization next week on nonpartisan redistricting. Now, parties have a place; but 
party
 loyalty, I don't think, should get in the way of doing what you as an elected official believe what's right. 
And I
 think that's what most of the public wants.
"
104,"
MR. GREGORY:
You say you don't want to run for president. Yet, based on all my reporting, you're taking a serious look at this, doing some calculations about whether this could be something that you could actually win. Are you saying that you're not even looking at the possibility of running?
"
105,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
No, I'm not looking at the possibility of running. I've got a great job, and I'm going to stay with it.
"
106,"
MR. GREGORY:
OK. So...
"
107,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
I am going to speak out on those things that affect 
New York City
. That's my job. People that say, ""Oh, you shouldn't be talking on a 
national
 level,"" well, we crated 55,000 private sector jobs in 
New York
 in the last 12 months. That's 
much greater than
 the percentage we should create with our population. But we can't do everything without help from the 
federal government
 and our 
state government
. And so I'm out there talking about immigration, talking about regulation, talking about the president being out there selling our products, all of these kinds of things, because that'll help us out.
"
108,"
MR. GREGORY:
But if, if advisers came to you and said, ""You know, Mr. Mayor, we've taken a hard look at this. We think this would not just be a vanity plate, you could actually win this thing,"" would you change your mind?
"
109,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
No.
"
110,"
MR. GREGORY:
No way, no how?
"
111,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
No way, no how. Because...
"
112,"
MR. GREGORY:
So your supporters who, who create all this buzz should cease and desist?
"
113,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
They -- I don't think most of them do create this buzz. I mean, yes, they should cease and desist, but most of this is just because the press wants to have something to write about. But the 
bottom line
 is, I've got a great job, I want to go out being, having a reputation as a very good, maybe the greatest mayor ever. 
And I
'm lucky to have three predecessors, 
Giuliani
 and 
Dinkins
 and 
Koch
, all of whom have been very helpful in trying to make me a better mayor.
"
114,"
MR. GREGORY:
One of the things you said, I want to play another portion of your speech from Wednesday, because you talked about the broken nature of our politics. And let me show that piece of it.
"
115,"

"
116,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
Despite what ideologues on the left believe, 
government
 can't 
tax and spend
 its way back to prosperity, especially when that spending is driven by 
pork barrel politics
. At the same time, despite what ideologues on the right believe, 
government
 should not stand aside and wait for the 
business cycle
 to run its natural course.
"
117,"

"
118,"
MR. GREGORY:
As somebody who wants to influence the 
national
 dialogue, you know, we've looked at this, sounds a lot like what candidate 
Obama
 said in 
2008
. And it's easy on the outside to say that kind of thing rhetorically. But what makes you think that you or anybody else who believes what you believe, could come in to be the president and could roll 
Congress
, and could somehow do what the president has been unable to do in terms of bridging that divide?
"
119,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
Well, my job is to do what I'd said the federal and 
state government
 should do in 
New York
, at our level. And been in office for nine years now, 
New York City
 has done pretty well during that period of time. We never had the deep 
recession
 that other cities have, and we have recovered faster.
"
120,"
MR. GREGORY:
But the question is still, how do you -- even a 
New York
 model, you're not dealing with 
Congress
. Isn't it 
easier said than done
 to say from the outside, ""Hey, get in there and roll 
Congress
, tell the 
far left
 and the far right that they're both irrational""?
"
121,"
MAYOR BLOOMBERG:
You know, this -- there's no easy jobs in the 
world
, and particularly in the politically charged 
world
 that we live in with the constant scrutiny of the press and the lack of bill -- of funds to go ahead. But, you know, that's the job. 
And I
 think the president is personally capable of doing it, and I think he is doing it. I think we don't give him enough credit. I have said he should go around the 
world
 and, and sell our products. He was in 
India
. I -- he negotiated a trade deal with 
Korea
, which I think will be great for our manufacturers who will sell to 
Korea
, and great for the consumers who will buy stuff from 
Korea
. I've said that he should get more business experience on -- in his advisers. Why? Well, I -- well, I come from the business background, so of course I would think that. But you, you read the papers, he's talking to 
Roger Altman
, somebody I was told in the -- saw in the paper was being considered. He'd be perfect. There are other people like that who can give him a broader perspective, and I think the perspective of somebody who's actually had to get up in the morning and sweep the floors before his employees can -- came in, and locked the door afterwards, and worry about how to make the, the payroll is exactly the kind of experience that he should have himself, or if he doesn't have it, because nobody's going to have all experiences, get other people that have that they can tell him and say, ""You know, what you're talking about is theoretical. Let me tell you the 
real world

real world
 is about.

tax cuts
 this week and the president's difficulties with his liberal base. 
Savannah Guthrie

President Clinton
 comes to meet with 
President Obama
. They meet privately, presumably to get some advice. And then a funny thing happens on the way to the exit, and that is they find their way into the briefing room. And, and watching the scene unfold was great 
Washington
 theater. Here was a portion of it.

PRES. OBAMA:
I'm going to let him speak very briefly, and then I've actually got to go over and do some -- just one more

MR. GREGORY:

Savannah Guthrie

Bill Clinton
 felt or that he expressed.
"
142,"
MS. SAVANNAH GUTHRIE:
Yes.
"
143,"
MR. GREGORY:
What was behind that? And what good did it do them, do they think?
"
144,"
MS. GUTHRIE:
Well, it may not surprise you, having watched that, that this was not something that was planned over a series of days. This was as ad hoc as it gets. In fact, when the two presidents came down to the press briefing room, they found it locked, had to go back, were wandering around trying to get into the briefing room. They ran into press secretary 
Gibbs
 and they said, ""We're looking to talk to some reporters."" And he said, ""Give me five minutes."" Look, they had this meeting, it was long scheduled. The president had called 
President Clinton
 after the midterms to express his thanks for what he'd done in the campaigns. They scheduled this meeting. Frankly, until they had this meeting, the 
White House
 and 
White House
 aides weren't 100 percent sure where former 
President Clinton
 stood on the tax deal. Having met in the 
Oval Office
 90 minutes, the two presidents decided amongst themselves to come out and do this news conference. 
And I
 think, especially in a week in which the 
left wing
 of the 
party
 was so disappointed with the president, to have this former president, considered the most successful Democratic president in modern history, come out and ratify the deal, validate it...
"
145,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
146,"
MS. GUTHRIE:
...they felt it was well worth it.
"
147,"
MR. GREGORY:
And, Congressman 
Weiner
, look, he was speaking to you. I mean, you have been outspoken in your opposition to this tax 
compromise
. And to have the president, the former president up there to synthesize the deal, to make the case for it, this is in part what he said to opponents like yourself.
"
148,"

"
149,"
PRES. CLINTON:
Look, if we had five percent 
growth
 and unemployment was dropping like a rock, maybe you could have the so-called 
Mexican standoff
 and you could say, ""It'll be you, not me, the voters will hold responsible for 
raising taxes
 on 
middle class
 people if they all go down, you know, next year."" That is not the circumstance we face.
"
150,"

"
151,"
MR. GREGORY:
His point, this is not the time to 
fight
 in the way that you 
wanted
 the president to.
"
152,"
REP. ANTHONY WEINER (D-NY):
Well, since he officiated my wedding, I think I'm constitutionally prohibited from disagreeing with him. But one of the things that 
President Clinton
 being there reminded us is the difference in the attitude that the 
White House
 took with the 
Gingrich Congress
 when he was there. He stood up and fought for the values of the 
Democratic Party
, fought for what we, what we cared for and made the 
Congress
, the Republican-led 
Congress
, the reason that the, that the 
country
 came to a standstill with the 
government shutdown
. Look, many of us have been saying that we want the president to succeed. And it's simply a
"
153,"
question of this:
In these times, when the 
middle class
 is under so much pressure, when debt is approaching $14 trillion 
dollars
, can we really afford to give millionaires $160,000 
tax cut
? That's really the big question here. 
And I
 think that now you saw Mr. 
Goolsbee
, the president, even 
President Clinton
 all 
agree
 that the answer is no, yet that doesn't seem to be the 
fight
 that we had in 
Washington
.
"
154,"
MR. GREGORY:
In the end, do you vote against this?
"
155,"
REP. WEINER:
Well, I think the entire 
House of Representatives
 on the Democratic side has said we're not going for this deal. I believe in a couple of things. One, we have to get something done to make sure the 
taxes
 go down on the 
middle class
, and two, it has to be done quickly. So now we're going our job in 
Congress
. We're going to change this, and we're going to -- hopefully the president's going to back us up as we try to take out the worst things that are in it.
"
156,"
MR. GREGORY:
Congressman, how do you see it?
"
157,"
FMR. REP. HAROLD FORD JR. (D-TN):
This position that 
Anthony
's taking is the one that was rejected on 
November 2nd
. As much as I believe that all 
taxes
 should go up on every American to some small extent, we're dealing with a different 
Congress
 and a different reality. In comparison to 
President Clinton
 when he lost in '94, remember, unemployment was not at 10 percent. The kind of whipping that we took as 
Democrats
 in the 
Congress
 was not as large and as grave as it was just a few weeks ago. I think the president should lean more into this 
agreement
. We got everything we 
wanted
. We got the cuts for the 
middle class
, we got a payroll 
tax cut
, we got an acceleration of business 
tax cuts
. We even have extended some of the other 
tax cuts
 that the president 
wanted
, and in addition, 13 months of 
unemployment compensation
. The only thing that we added was the cuts for the top earners. Now that's less than a quarter of the spending. If you look at the bulk of the spending, the additional debt spending here, the majority of it is for the 
middle class
 cuts which I 
support
. Now, if we had 65 votes in the 
Senate
, 300 in the 
House
, I think 
Anthony
's point would be the one that would be followed. But 
President Clinton
 said it very well. There -- this is no time for a 
Mexican standoff
. The challenges we face are grave, the 
agreement
 reached by this president and 
Republicans
 is a good one. It could have been worse. And, frankly, I think the president should be prouder of it and use different language to 
support
 it.
"
158,"
MR. GREGORY:
But, but, 
Paul Gigot
, the question is to you, does this signal an actual shift in the president's philosophy about what's going to make the 
economy
 work again?
"
159,"
MR. PAUL GIGOT:
Well, they're saying, ""No, no, no. No, shift."" However, implicitly, it is a shift. I love the symbolism of two 
Democratic presidents
 -- not one, but two -- endorsing 
Bush tax cuts
, saying, ""We need them crucially to help the 
economy
."" The president, I think, is implicitly admitting that 
tax rates
 matter. After a couple of years, as you showed on the -- with the, the discussion with 
Austan Goolsbee
 and 
Tim Geithner
 had said, ""They don't matter."" We -- now they're saying, yes, they do matter, and then implicitly admitting that 
tax cuts
 matter more for 
growth
 than spending. And it makes you wonder why didn't they do this two years ago.
"
160,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm. Congressman, you heard from 
Mayor Bloomberg
. To the left, the president should say, ""Suck it up. You got to take the longer view here."" I gather that didn't sit well with you.
"
161,"
REP. WEINER:
No, I -- look, I -- it depends on what your philosophy is. I'm not a member of the tail-between-my-legs wing of the 
Democratic Party
. I believe we still 
fight
 for the things we care about. 
And I
 believe this...
"
162,"
MR. GREGORY:
You think the president is?
"
163,"
REP. WEINER:
Well, here's what I will say. This is not a fringe element of the debate that's gone on in the last 10 years. This is the very crux of it. The 
middle class
 is getting crushed while the very-well-to-do have done remarkably, remarkably well. You know, I did a 
little
 math on the back of an envelope here on the way in. Three percent of the beneficiaries of this -- of the 
tax cuts
 are going to get 38 percent of the cash. It's just not fair. And also something else. You know, you cannot say you are concerned about the debt and the 
deficit
 and 
support
 giving giant 
tax cuts
 on the 
estate
 -- on estates of billionaires. Or giant 
tax cuts
 to millionaires. It's just inconsistent. So I believe you 
fight
 for the values. And today, with a majority in the 
House
, the majority in the 
Senate
, and we control the presidency and we're acting like we have a weak hand. We have the right side of the issues and the numbers, and I don't know why should -- we don't 
fight
 more.
"
164,"
MR. GREGORY:
It's a question of timing, 
Savannah
, too. Why it is that the president put himself in this position to have to negotiate out of such weakness and what's going to be different in 
2012
, another 
political
 year, for him to think he's going to be able to prevail in this argument?
"
165,"
MS. GUTHRIE:
Well, on this latter question, you heard 
Austan Goolsbee
 basically make the argument, ""We think the 
economy
 will be in a better position."" They are banking everything on that because they think they'll be able to say, ""Look, now we can afford to see those 
tax rates
 rise on the 
wealthiest Americans
."" One of the most potent arguments against letting those 
wealthiest Americans
' 
tax cuts
 expire. On the 
Republican side
 was, ""It will imperil the recovery. You can never raise tax in a 
recession
."" I think the president has not backed off his position of being against the 
tax cuts
, you know, rolling back the 
tax cuts
 for the wealthiest. I think the point is he's staring at the 
barrel of a gun
. These 
tax rates
 are going up in 
January
, and he's not going to take that gamble. And that's why he made this deal. The question is...
"
166,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
167,"
MS. GUTHRIE:
...six months ago, why didn't 
Democrats
 in the 
House
 force this issue. Why didn't they make it a campaign issue, as some liberals members of the, the caucus 
wanted
 to?
"
168,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah.
"
169,"
REP. FORD:

Democrats
 probably should have done that, and I supported them doing that. But, but, 
Paul
, in fairness, y'all wrote a great editorial, and it was funny in some ways saying 
President Bush
 should have been on the panel, been up there with 
President Obama
 and, and 
Clinton
. The reality is, one of the reasons we're in the mess that we're in, is that we passed 
Medicare
 prescription drug plan without paying for it, which 
President Bush
 did.
"
170,"
MR. GIGOT:
I was opposed.
"
171,"
REP. FORD:
You wouldn't ask him to be up on the panel on that one. We're fighting two wars that we have not paid for, as much as they're noble causes and noble ends to, and I got to think we're going to have a strategic reassessment of whether or not 
Afghanistan
 should continue. But 
President Obama
 has a unique opportunity now to reduce the debt. I hope 
The Wall Street Journal
 and others will ask the, the 
Paul Ryans
 of the 
world
, will ask the 
Jeb Hensarlings
 of the 
world
 to 
support
 responsible, responsible tax increases...
"
172,"
MR. GIGOT:
We're in favor of....
"
173,"
REP. FORD:
...and responsible spending cuts. You cannot be for just cutting spending and not 
raising taxes
 at some level. I think this president might have had a stronger hand had he just said, ""You know, we're going to raise 
taxes
 on everybody, and I'm going to stand firm."" But since he chose not to do that, which I'm glad he did not...
"
174,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
175,"
REP. FORD:
...I think it's the right thing to do, and I think that 
Anthony
 and others will come around and find a way to 
support
 this guy's bill.
"
176,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, let me, let me -- quickly, and then I want to get a break in, 
Paul
...
"
177,"
MR. GIGOT:
Yeah.
"
178,"
MR. GREGORY:
...what about, you know, 
Peter Orszag
's point, which is all of them -- all of these 
tax cuts
 are simply unaffordable, and in two years, they ought to all go away.
"
179,"
MR. GIGOT:
Right. No. No, I don't, I don't 
agree
 with that.
"
180,"
MR. GREGORY:
You don't 
agree
.
"
181,"
MR. GIGOT:
Look, I'd love to see a larger 
tax reform
...
"
182,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right, which the president has talked about wanting to do.
"
183,"
MR. GIGOT:
...because all this really does, all this, this deal really does is extend the status quo. So that's not terrific. It's going to help avoid a huge hit to the 
economy
 in 
2011
, and that's good, but I'd love to see a larger 
reform
. Maybe both parties can get together on that, and maybe that's the kind of debate we'll have going into 
2012
.
"
184,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. I want to take a break here. I want to come back and ask two very, you know, pointed questions. Is there something of a war between the president and the left, given his comments this week? And what does this deal say about the next couple of years in 
Washington
 in terms of bipartisanship? More from our roundtable after this quick break.
"
185,"

"
186,"
MR. GREGORY:
We're back with more from our roundtable because they just 
keep talking
 even during the break. You got to hear all of this. Congressman 
Weiner
, to hear the president say it this week, he is irritated with liberals in his 
party
. And, as he talked about this deal and he talked about the criticism on the left, he said it was like a return to the debate over 
health care
 and the public option. And his point was, ""Look, I could have stuck to my guns on that and then we wouldn't have had 
healthcare reform
 at all."" Listen to how he put it.
"
187,"

"
188,"
PRES. BARACK OBAMA:
So this notion that somehow, you know, we are willing to 
compromise
 too much reminds me of the debate that we had during 
health care
. This is the public option debate all over again. And we will be able to feel good about ourselves and sanctimonious about how pure our intentions are and how tough we are. And, in the meantime, the 
American people
 are still seeing themselves not able to get 
health insurance
 because of pre-existing condition.
"
189,"

"
190,"
MR. GREGORY:
That's his view. In 
Congress
 this week, you were leading a chant that said, ""No we can't,"" not ""Yes, we can."" This is a real standoff.
"
191,"
REP. WEINER:
Well, first of all, I wasn't leading any such chant. But, look, let me, let me just say this, that the president has to 
understand
 that critique that he gets from his base and his supporters who want him to succeed is fundamentally different from the one they get from 
Mitch McConnell
. We're trying to help him be successful, and I kind of 
agree
 with him, this is like the public option. If he would have fought harder for that, we would have had it. You know, I think that we need -- the president needs to 
understand
 that there's an enormous number of us who are just waiting to be called to kind of really have this competition of ideas. We really need to have this contest. And, you know, look, he made a deal. It doesn't necessarily mean it's a great one. We, in 
Congress
, now have it. We're trying to improve upon it. But we're on his team. That's the fundamental difference he needs to 
understand
. When he calls us sanctimonious and says this is like past debates, all -- the only reason, the only reason that it's like past debates is we still want him to be the president that we elected. And we're going to help him do that. And if he digs in and he fights for these values, he's going to find the 
American people
support
 it, and we, his supporters, are really going to rally to his side.
"
192,"
MR. GREGORY:
You know, 
Harold
, the question was, was this a 
Sister Souljah moment
, to go back to the 
Clinton
 era, for 
President Obama
, standing up to the base?
"
193,"
REP. FORD:
Look, I think it's a moment where he's standing up for 
America
 and standing up for jobs. Look, I like 
Anthony
, respect him a lot, but to suggest that the president doesn't 
fight
 a lot, we had a 
fight
, we had an outcome declared on 
November 2nd
. Now, he has fought and fought and fought, and frankly, has given 
Democrats
 in the 
Congress
 the ball to run every time. Unfortunately, the 
American people
, whether it's a communications problem, and I don't think it is. 
It's hard
 to communicate effectively when we have 9.8 percent unemployment, and have people rally around you. The reality is we've done that before. The president's move last week was an important move for the 
American people
; and, 
at the end of the day
, if unemployment begins to drop over the next quarter or two by a quarter point, every Democrat, including 
Anthony
 and others, will say, ""This was the right thing to do. Now we have to look at the next step in reducing the debt and ensuring that we create jobs.
"
194,"
MR. GREGORY:
But the larger question, 
Savannah
, is, what does this say about how this president wants to do business in 
Washington
 over the next couple of years?
"
195,"
MS. GUTHRIE:
Well, what's fascinating about this is, I don't know that there was a ton of strategy going into this. I think as, again, it was dictated by circumstances, they had to make a deal, they felt they had to. But perhaps they stumbled upon a strategy, which is to draw out the partisans on both sides and stake out this 
middle ground
. And that news conference on Tuesday was so remarkable in the sense that it seemed to me to be the most authentic view of 
President Obama
 we've seen. This seemed to me to be the closest approximation of the man behind closed doors being forceful and compelling. But, interestingly, all that 
fight
, all that vim and vigor, was directed toward the left of his own 
party
. And you can see that he's incredibly frustrated by that. It's almost as though he thinks 
Republicans
, ""Well, gosh, I expected them to oppose me.""
"
196,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
197,"
MS. GUTHRIE:
""But where's the love? Why aren't 
Democrats
, why isn't the left in my own 
party
 supporting me when I'm out there bleeding on things like 
health care
, things that have been articles of faith in the 
Democratic Party
 for years.""
"
198,"
MR. GREGORY:
The -- there -- 
Paul Gigot
, there was a -- one conservative who's been talked a lot about, 
The Washington Post
's 
Charles Krauthammer
, the columnist who apparently the 
White House
 loves now, at least this week, because he wrote the following, which is much more complimentary of 
Obama
 and where he's going in the next couple of years. He writes
"
199,"
this:
""At great cost that will have to be paid after this newest free lunch, this 
package
 will add as much as 1 percent to 
GDP
 and lower the 
unemployment rate
 by about 1.5 percentage points, That could easily be the difference between victory and defeat in 
2012
. ""
Obama
's no fool,"" he writes. ""While getting 
Republicans
 to boost his reelection chances, he gets them to make a mockery of their newfound, second-chance, post-
Bush
, 
Tea
-
Party
, this- time-we're-serious persona of debt-averse 
fiscal responsibility
.""
"
200,"
MR. GIGOT:
Well, that's a 
little
 overstated, but I think 
Charles
 is right that this is a victory for the president. I mean, it's going to help the 
economy
 by not having a huge tax increase. I don't think it's going to be that great a stimulus, but the 
economy
 right now has some momentum. This makes sure that we're not going to stop that momentum and send the 
economy
 back into 
recession
. But on when it comes to -- so it is going to help him, no question about it. It also going to -- helps 
Republicans
, though, honor a 
campaign promise
. So they get to do that. But I'll tell you, there are a lot of 
Republicans
 who aren't thrilled with this deal because they had to give up a lot...
"
201,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
202,"
MR. GIGOT:
And they -- they'd love to see the 
House
 Democrats defeat this, because they'll come back in 
January
 and say, ""We'll clean up the mess. You'll be responsible for the tax increase, we'll get a better deal for our voters.""
"
203,"
REP. WIENER:
But it's also the only thing that the 
Republicans
 really 
wanted
 coming out of this campaign. We know what they're against. They're against 
health care
, they're against a lot of things the 
Democrats
 did the last couple of years. The only things they really 
wanted
 they now got. They've got them. So where does the leverage come now? You know, the 
estate tax
 was going to lapse in 
January
, it's going to go down much...

207,"
REP. WEINER:
But, but here's the thing, and I just want to make sure we 
understand
 this. Every one of the economists the president rolled out and supported this plan, every one of them said the 
tax cuts
 on the upper brackets and the 
estate tax
 do virtually zero on the stimulus side to add to that 
growth
. Those were the giveaways to the 
Republicans
. So the question is this, when did the 
fight
 happen, did the full-throated 
fight
 happen? 
Harold
 is a hundred percent wrong if you think it happened during the campaign. The president gave a grand total of one speech in October in 
Ohio
 where he even mentioned it. Between the time of the 
State of the Union
 and the 
election

Republicans
 is the priorities. We defend...

REP. WEINER:
We defend the 
middle class

fight

MR. GREGORY:
All right.

REP. FORD:

Anthony
, your position was defeated roundly 
November 2nd
. I'm a Democrat, I'm a proud Democrat. But more importantly, I'm a proud American. The president, 
for the first time
 in the eyes of many 
Americans
, particularly independents who voted for him, said, ""You know what, we're going to strike a deal."" I got everything I 
wanted
. I don't know of anything in this tax deal that we didn't get as 
Democrats
 that we 
wanted
. And what did he do? He extended the cuts for the top earners. Now, remember, we lost an 
election
. If we had gained 60 seats, then what you're saying, you wouldn't have to be here. There'd be a huge 
agreement
, broad 
agreement

American people

Gigot; and NBC News White House correspondent Savannah Guthrie. "
230,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
231,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
232,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Back in September, Austan Goolsbee was appointed chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, the two-person agency charged with providing the president with objective economic advice to help shape his policies both at home and abroad.  Along with Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, Goolsbee is part of the group that delivers a daily economic briefing to the president.  He's been part of the president's inner circle and one of his closest advisers since the two met when Obama was running for the Senate in 2004.  Goolsbee is now front and center in the administration's attempts to achieve agreement in Congress on this tax cut deal before they go home for the holidays."
233,"Mr. Goolsbee, welcome to MEET THE PRESS."
234,"MR. AUSTAN GOOLSBEE:  Thanks for having me, David."
235,MR. GREGORY:  And let's start there.  You going to get a deal?  Is this going to pass through Congress before Christmas?
236,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  I certainly hope it does.  I mean, the--what the president got in the package is very important for the economy.  And to see 150, 200 million people and their families have their taxes go up in less than three weeks I think would be a serious blow.  So I, I think everybody should take a step back if they--I understand the feeling that it's a bitter pill to swallow, the high income tax cuts.  But what the president was able to get that is substantially bigger than that and important for the economy, whether it's incentives for investment for firms, whether it's a payroll tax cut for 155 million workers, money for college
education, etc., it's really important and we can't let that go away."
237,"MR. GREGORY:  You're predicting passage, though?"
238,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  I, I'm predicting passage."
239,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk about the rationale for this deal.  This week the president's economic adviser, Larry Summers, warned of the consequences of inaction here in a briefing.  I'll put part of what he said up on the screen. ""Failure to pass this bill,"" Summers said, ""in the next couple weeks would materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out and we would have a double-dip [recession]."" Now, for months this administration, the president's economic advisers, have been downplaying, dismissing the idea of a double-dip recession.  And yet here, when it comes to building political support for this tax deal, suddenly this is the, the fear.  Is this a scare tactic? "
240,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  Well, look.  I, I think that takes Larry's comment a little out of context.  I think all private forecasters agree that--when they saw this package announced, you saw them step forward and say that it would significantly raise the growth rate of the United States in the coming year if we were to pass it and get the unemployment rate down and jobs created more than they thought before that.  And if you let these tax cuts expire, which they will in 20 days if we do nothing, I think that would be a serious blow to the economy.  Everybody agrees on that. So I, I don't think we should get into the semantics of whether it's
what--how much it raises the probability of double dip.  I think we should just recognize not acting is very bad for the economy, and acting would be good for the economy.  That's why we should do it."
241,"MR. GREGORY:  What about the effect on jobs?  Because that's what matters here, right, whether the unemployment rate is going to come down.  Ron Brownstein, in his column in the National Journal, is critical of that prospect of stimulus.  This is, again, part of what he wrote this week: ""It further entrenches,"" this deal, ""the Bush tax cuts, even though the median income and the number of Americans with jobs are lower today than when the tax cuts were originally signed in 2001 (an almost unprecedented decade-long record of futility)."" What evidence is there that this kind of tax cutting is actually going to get people back to work?"
242,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  OK, wait.  Be, be a little careful with that because the context before the president came out with this deal was a bit the cycle of dysfunction, in which Democrats are putting forward reasonable ideas like a three-month extension of unemployment--defeated; extending the middle class part of the Bush tax cuts--defeated.  The Republicans are also arguing about the Bush tax cuts.  What the president was able to do in this negotiation was expand the board beyond just the Bush tax cuts. The important stuff in this, in addition to preserving the tax cuts for the middle class, are the Obama tax cuts.  So you've got incentives for education, a new payroll tax cut for 155 million workers, the earned income tax credit, investment incentives that are new.  These are things which I think help the economy.  And all I would say to Mr. Brownstein, who I respect a great deal, is that when they announced this
package--it's not often that Washington announces something that leads the private economic forecasters to come out and say, ""We believe the GDP growth rate will be one point higher."" But that's what they did."
243,"MR. GREGORY:  But I'm asking about the president's economic philosophy. But, Mr. Goolsbee, this is the tough question."
244,MR. GOOLSBEE:  Yes.
245,"MR. GREGORY:  The president and his economic team said in the first  stimulus that the tax cut provisions there were the least stimulative part of the package.  Now I'm asking whether or not you believe there's a change in philosophy here, that in fact tax cuts are going to put people
back to work and stimulate the economy."
246,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  Well, the, the question is tax--which tax cuts?  I don't believe, the president doesn't believe, that the high income tax cuts work, period.  I don't think the evidence supports that.  And, as I say, that's a bitter pill to have to deal with.  But it's a compromise.  And by giving that one piece, we were able to get a series of things that I think make a big difference to the middle class and to working families."
247,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, but what about 2012?  This is a two-year extension. The president said, ""Look, you know, we're going to wait till 2012, make the case that these upper--the tax cuts on the upper earners, that they don't make economic sense."" What makes him think that he can make a better case in 2012? You really think in an election year you're not going to see a vote in Congress to extend these?"
248,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  Well, I think the, the only argument that's being put forward by the Republicans of why to extend them are, as you come out of the deepest recession since 1929, we shouldn't affect anybody's taxes. In 2012 that's not going to be the circumstance.  In 2012, I believe they will have to stand up and defend on their own merits that they think these high income tax cuts work, and they will not be able to do that because they don't.  But the point was, by giving on this one issue, the president got more than twice as much than the size of those for his priorities that are going to help us grow our way out of this."
249,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we're--let's talk about the broader context here. We're talking about a jobs crisis, we're also talking about a debt crisis. This is what Treasury Secretary Geithner said back in August about a temporary extension of the tax cut for wealthiest Americans in
the country.  This is what he said."
250,"(Videotape, August 4, 2010)"
251,"SEC'Y TIMOTHY GEITHNER:  The world is likely to view any temporary extension of the income tax cuts for the top two percent as a prelude to a long-term or permanent extension, and that would hurt economic recovery as well by undermining confidence that we're prepared to make a commitment today to bring down our future deficits."
252,(End videotape)
253,"MR. GREGORY:  Now, you've got a compromise here, but isn't the secretary's warning already coming true?  Eighty hours after the president says the debt commission did great work to slash the deficit, within 80 hours he's announcing this compromise deal that adds a trillion
dollars to the deficit; and a two-year extension to 2012, when the prospects of reversing these is really very difficult to imagine, in an election year, that Congress wouldn't extend the tax cuts further."
254,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  Well, you got a couple questions embodied in that question. The first, on the adding to the deficit, it's--the majority of that money is preventing taxes from rising in this recession. There's--that's $500-plus billion of the total.  There's $350 billion of new tax cuts that are on the Obama program.  So I think it's, it's a little bit different.  I agree that that is the downside.  The president doesn't support--if we were voting just on extending the high income tax cuts on their own, we would be 100 percent against it.  The--they don't
work, and we've all been publicly stating for many--for a long time that they don't.  But by trading that, we were able to get things that really matter for the economy.  And..."
255,MR. GREGORY:  But how can you show you're serious about long-term efforts to bring down the debt?
256,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  OK, then that's the second part of your question, and what I would emphasize there is the, the Bowles-Simpson fiscal commission and other fiscal commissions highlight that it's medium and long-run fiscal consolidation and responsibility which is their goal.  You cannot reduce the deficit if the economy is not growing.  Period.  They each have made clear that the short-run growth of the economy--we, we should not be conflating medium-run deficit reduction with short-run getting out of recession and getting ourselves growing."
257,MR. GREGORY:  That's not a distinction Secretary Geithner made in August.
258,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  Well, I, I, I don't know that that's true.  Secretary Geithner has made that distinction many times."
259,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, the, the language is plain, which is that if you extend them temporarily, which was done..."
260,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  Well, I don't what is said just before and just after that."
261,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but his language says--I didn't take it out of context."
262,MR. GOOLSBEE:  We have said...
263,MR. GREGORY:  The language is plain.
264,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  ...""Do not, do not make these high income tax cuts permanent. We cannot afford to do that.  It would be a mistake."" I agree there is some risk.  But we are going to fight that; and, as I say, in 2012 we will have been growing out way out of this and those tax cuts
will have to stand on their own merits, which they cannot.  In the meantime, by making that two-year trade, we got things on the Obama priority list, twice as much as what's in those high income tax cuts, that are fundamentally important for the growth of the economy."
265,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Mr. Goolsbee, is it a fundamental flaw that this compromise did not accompany long-term solutions to deal with the debt?"
266,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  I, I don't know that we could sort out the entire long-run solutions to the debt in the 20 days that remain before hundreds of millions of Americans are about to see their taxes go up.  The president created the fiscal commission, believes that the medium and long-run fiscal consolidation that's required in the country is critically important.  But we've got to sort that out in a way that is distinct from getting the economy growing, which is what we're going to do with this package."
267,"MR. GREGORY:  Be--after two years, when you hit that two-year mark of the extension, do you agree with Peter Orszag, who was the budget director for the president, that tax cuts for wealthy Americans, even for the middle-class, are simply unaffordable?"
268,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  Well, I absolutely agree that the 700 billion that you've got to borrow to, to pay for the high income tax cuts is a mistake because that doesn't work.  Now I--the president has called for extending the middle-class part of the tax cuts permanently, and I don't think you can try to balance the budget just on the backs of the middle class. That will not work."
269,MR. GREGORY:  But can we afford even middle-class tax cuts?
270,MR. GOOLSBEE:  We can...
271,MR. GREGORY:  Peter Orszag said we can't.
272,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  It depends what other actions you take.  It's clear that the medium and long-run fiscal challenges facing the country have to do with the rise of entitlement spending, they have to do with the longer run imbalances that we've created in the structure of the system.
It--you can't just choose one thing and say, ""Can you afford this one piece?"" unless you're looking at the whole package.  That's why the president set up the commission."
273,"MR. GREGORY:  Final question, quickly.  When do you think we'll see a meaningful reduction in the unemployment rate?"
274,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  Well, as you know, the unemployment rate in influenced, not just by how many jobs are created, but also by people coming in from the out-of-the-labor-force status.  There's an official forecast and--that the government puts out and we update it every six months, it's been a little better so far this year than it was forecast to be in February, but it's not nearly enough.  Having private sector job growth for 11 months and adding 1.2 million jobs is a good start, but we've got to do much more.  This tax deal, according to private forecasters, goes a long way to up the growth rate. That's why the president's for it.
That's why he insisted to try to get these things in it. "
275,MR. GREGORY:  And it'll bring down unemployment in your view?
276,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  I think it will, but it's--look, deepest hole since 1929, it takes a while to get out of that, there's no question."
277,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we'll leave it there.  Mr. Goolsbee, thank you very much."
278,"MR. GOOLSBEE:  Thank you for having me, David."
279,"MR. GREGORY:  And coming up next, the politics of the center. Independent mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, joins me exclusively to discuss the economy, Washington, and his own political future.  Then it's our political roundtable on bipartisanship and the state of the president's relationship with his liberal base:  Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner; former congressman, Democrat, Harold Ford; The Wall Street Journal's Paul Gigot; and NBC's Savannah Guthrie."
280,(Announcements)
281,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming next, my exclusive interview with independent New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.  If Washington is broken, could an independent candidate be the answer?  Right after this brief commercial beak."
282,(Announcements)
283,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We are back, joined now by the mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg."
284,Welcome back.  Always nice to have you.
285,MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG:  Thank you for having me.
286,"MR. GREGORY:  You have heard the administration make its case on the issue of tax cuts.  I want to ask you, last time you were here you were in favor of a temporary extension of the tax cuts, middle class, wealthier earners.  But you felt it had to be pegged to some long-term
solutions as well, which is not the case in this compromise.  Are you disappointed with what's been accomplished?"
287,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  No, I think you should be encouraged because at least the--both sides of the aisle and both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue have finally come together to do something in a bipartisan way.  And I'm sure the president would have liked other things, but the real world of governing is to do what is possible, and everybody getting something, nobody getting 100 percent of what they want.  So I think--I view this as the first step.  And incidentally, the president did get some of the things he wanted--an extension of some tax cuts that he was in favor of for business, and an extension of benefits for the unemployed."
288,"MR. GREGORY:  What about the debt?  I mean, here we were--last week the president was talking about the debt, the Debt Commission's findings. Within 80 hours he is championing an agreement that adds a trillion dollars to the debt."
289,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Well, the bottom line is, unless he does this, he's not going to get a chance to do the next step.  You know, the president has got to get some of the other party to go along with him, and he's got to keep his own party in line.  That's what leadership is all about.  And you can't sit there and say, ""I'm going to do everything at once,"" you'll never get anything done. He's made a step, he's opened the door, and I think now it's incumbent on him to keep working together with the Republicans and the Democrats.  And the next thing is going to be a lot tougher, as you point out.  It's easy to reduce taxes, very hard to reduce expenses."
290,"MR. GREGORY:  But is there a concern that when, really, people look at this, this is a two-year extension..."
291,MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Yeah.
292,"MR. GREGORY:  ...2012, hard to believe any politician's not going to vote in an election year to extend tax cuts.  Does it send a signal that we're not serious about tackling the long-term debt picture?"
293,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  I don't--no, I don't think it does that.  I think we are not serious about attacking the long-term debt problem, and that's one of the things that he's going to have to find a way to get on the agenda.  You saw--you have this commission, well-run commission, some smart people, they come up with some ideas, and then Congress doesn't even want to consider them. That's disappointing."
294,"On the other hand, eventually they're going to have to face some of these issues because some--the Chinese are going to stop buying our debt, we're going to get to the point where business has so little confidence they're not willing to expand.  There's a lot of problems facing us down the road.  Some of these trust funds, like Social Security, running out of money.  Medicaid and Medicare just taking over the whole economy.  So, whether you like it or not, there's going to be a point where you have to stop kicking the can down the road.  And this president is, his job is, to some extent, to explain to the public why that's the case.  It's going
to require shared sacrifice. Never easy to get sacrifice, but that's what leadership's all about."
295,MR. GREGORY:  What about the impact on jobs?  Do you believe the tax cuts have an actual stimulative effect on the economy?
296,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  I don't think there's any question that they put more people--more money in people's hands, and I think that the public will do a better job with more money in their hands to stimulate the economy than you will do with government programs."
297,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Mayor, economists say, especially wealthier Americans don't end up necessarily spending money that they, that they keep through tax cuts.  And look at the effect of the Bush tax cuts over a decade. "
298,MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Well...
299,"MR. GREGORY:  ...what some have called a decade of, of futility, if you look at the number of jobs created."
300,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  OK.  But number one, some of these things are not connected, they just happen to have at same--happened at the same time. And I think the more money you put in people's hands, the more they will spend.  And if they don't spend it, they invest it.  And investing it is another way of creating jobs.  It puts money into mutual funds or other kinds of banks that can go out and make loans, and we need to do that. "
301,"MR. GREGORY:  What about the president's leadership?  You've had some observations about him, one of them in, in an interview with GQ, a portion of which I'll put up on the screen.  You said, ""The president, I think, needs some better advisers.  He campaigns, `I'm going to do A,'
then he doesn't do it.  Now he's pissed off the supporters and the opponents.  You go for it."" Does his agreement on this deal signal to you that he's going in a different direction?"
302,MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  No.  I think he signals that he's going for it.
303,MR. GREGORY:  He is going for it?
304,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Because--he's got--yeah, because he can't just sit there and depend on ideology.  His job is to lead, and, and leadership is about doing the possible, not sitting around and waiting for the perfect. You know, I start with the assumption that--or with, with the belief that this president has to succeed.  We all have an enormous amount of capital invested in his success.  His success is the country's success. And whether you like him or not, whether you voted for him or not, if you want to vote for somebody else, you'll have that opportunity in two years.  But right now we should all pull together--Republicans and Democrats, both sides of the aisle, the public as well as the elected officials--and make sure that this president's successful."
305,MR. GREGORY:  How does he deal with an angry liberal base?
306,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  He says, ""Look, this is what I did.  This is the best I can do.  Suck it up and let's get on together.  We have a lot of other things that we can do together.  This is not the only tough vote, this is not the only issue.  And whether you're a liberal or a conservative,
there are lots of other things that you probably feel the country should be doing and can do."""
307,"MR. GREGORY:  The big question is whether our nation's leaders are making the tough choices, whether they're making the sacrifices to really make progress. You spoke about that this week in New York about the gridlock in our politics."
308,MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Yes.
309,MR. GREGORY:  Let me play a portion of that.
310,"(Videotape, Wednesday)"
311,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  As families struggle to get by, they have seen little but partisan gridlock, political pandering and legislative influence peddling, finger-pointing, blame games, and endless attacks.  Put simply, when it comes to creating jobs, government hasn't gotten the job done."
312,(End videotape)
313,"MR. GREGORY:  And to follow up on that, do you think we have the balance right between investment in the economy, innovation in our economy, and the kind of austerity that you've just been talking about that is necessary to make tough choices about how much we're  spending?"
314,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  No, no, I don't.  I don't think that we're focusing on innovation.  If you go back and look at history, back in like--I think it was like 1816 or something like that, DeWitt Clinton built the Eric Canal.  It opened the whole Midwest.  During the Lincoln presidency, the
Civil War, transcontinental railway opened the whole country up.  Henry Ford, about 1900, 1905, all of a sudden created factories and processes that could employ and awful lot of people.  You go World War II, World War II did help the economy a little bit, but the great thing that came out of World War II was the GI bill. For the first time, the average person could go to college and have the skills to do it.  And you go right on, whether it was microchips or lasers or cell phones, the Internet, each of these things is innovative things that have created new industries, and we are not putting the kind of money into basic research
that we used to do, so that I don't know where the next thing is coming from.  And what's really worrisome is, because of our immigration policy, the next great thing might be invented or developed elsewheres, not in our country."
315,"MR. GREGORY:  But so that raises the question of--Larry Summers suggested this, this week--which is the best thing you can do for economic recovery is make sure you achieve rapid economic recovery before you get to the business of slashing the deficit.  And yet that doesn't seem to be where the politics is moving in Washington or, or even the voice of the electorate in midterms."
316,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  No, no, it isn't.  But on the other hand, I don't believe that you need big stimulus things to get the economy going.  I think there's some things that don't cost very much money but would have a much greater impact.  Number one, you've got to build confidence.  If you think about it, banks have money but they're unwilling to make loans.
Companies have money. I think we're at a record amount of cash.  There was an article in the paper the other day in companies, bank accounts that they are unwilling to spend on plant and new employees.  We've got to make sure that people understand that this country is going to pull together.  It's confidence more than anything else.  If people have confidence, the, the consumer will start spending money. And it's the biggest single impediment to growth."
317,"MR. GREGORY:  What about tough choices?  As you look at this landscape of spending, entitlements, other parts of the budget, immigration, what is a tough choice that you would support Washington making now that moves the country forward?"
318,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  First thing is open the doors to those with the skills we need from around the world.  I think the whole issue of what you do with 11 million undocumented, I feel very strongly we should give them a path to citizenship.  But, regardless, the whole issue of family
reunification, it's a compassion thing, understand that, but we cannot let those two issues, which are controversial and will take some time to work out, get in the way of right away starting to make sure anybody that gets a graduate degree in America from overseas gets a green card attached to their diploma.  That's the ways that we are going to keep going.  You know, all these other countries are trying to attract the best and the brightest, and we're helping them.  It's even worse, we're educating them and then helping them.  This is craziness.  I call it national suicide.  We have to go and, and get the immigrants here.  So
the first thing I would do is that, and that doesn't cost any money. "
319,MR. GREGORY:  Let me spend a couple minutes talking about politics. There was the cover of...
320,MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  I'm shocked.  I didn't think it would come up.
321,MR. GREGORY:  Shocked we would get to that.
322,MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Yeah.
323,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me show you the cover of the New York Post this week about your speech.  State of the Union.  ""Presidential"" in quotes, ""Mike reads riot act to DC."""
324,MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Good picture.
325,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think an independent can be president?
326,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  I don't know.  I'm not going to run for president, for the, the job.  I've got a great job.  I'm going to finish out my 1,100 and whatever number of days it is left to go, and I'll leave the politics to the experts."
327,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think that it's possible to scrap the two party system? Would you be in favor of that?
328,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Well, the original Founding Fathers didn't seem to have an interest in party politics, and I've worked very hard in New York for nonpartisan elections.  I'm going to give a speech at an organization next week on nonpartisan redistricting.  Now, parties have a place; but party loyalty, I don't think, should get in the way of doing what you as an elected official believe what's right.  And I think that's what most of the public wants."
329,"MR. GREGORY:  You say you don't want to run for president.  Yet, based on all my reporting, you're taking a serious look at this, doing some calculations about whether this could be something that you could actually win.  Are you saying that you're not even looking at the
possibility of running? "
330,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  No, I'm not looking at the possibility of running. I've got a great job, and I'm going to stay with it. "
331,MR. GREGORY:  OK.  So...
332,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  I am going to speak out on those things that affect New York City.  That's my job.  People that say, ""Oh, you shouldn't be talking on a national level,"" well, we crated 55,000 private sector jobs in New York in the last 12 months.  That's much greater than the percentage we should create with our population.  But we can't do everything without help from the federal government and our state government.  And so I'm out there talking about immigration, talking about regulation, talking about the president being out there selling our
products, all of these kinds of things, because that'll help us out."
333,"MR. GREGORY:  But if, if advisers came to you and said, ""You know, Mr. Mayor, we've taken a hard look at this.  We think this would not just be a vanity plate, you could actually win this thing,"" would you change your mind?"
334,MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  No.
335,"MR. GREGORY:  No way, no how?"
336,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  No way, no how.  Because..."
337,"MR. GREGORY:  So your supporters who, who create all this buzz should cease and desist?"
338,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  They--I don't think most of them do create this buzz. I mean, yes, they should cease and desist, but most of this is just because the press wants to have something to write about.  But the bottom line is, I've got a great job, I want to go out being, having a
reputation as a very good, maybe the greatest mayor ever.  And I'm lucky to have three predecessors, Giuliani and Dinkins and Koch, all of whom have been very helpful in trying to make me a better mayor."
339,"MR. GREGORY:  One of the things you said, I want to play another portion of your speech from Wednesday, because you talked about the broken nature of our politics.  And let me show that piece of it."
340,"(Videotape, Wednesday)"
341,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Despite what ideologues on the left believe, government can't tax and spend its way back to prosperity, especially when that spending is driven by pork barrel politics.  At the same time, despite what ideologues on the right believe, government should not stand aside and wait for the business cycle to run its natural course."
342,(End videotape)
343,"MR. GREGORY:  As somebody who wants to influence the national dialogue, you know, we've looked at this, sounds a lot like what candidate Obama said in 2008.  And it's easy on the outside to say that kind of thing rhetorically. But what makes you think that you or anybody else who believes what you believe, could come in to be the president and could roll Congress, and could somehow do what the president has been unable to do in terms of bridging that divide?"
344,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Well, my job is to do what I'd said the federal and state government should do in New York, at our level.  And been in office for nine years now, New York City has done pretty well during that period of time.  We never had the deep recession that other cities have, and we have recovered faster."
345,"MR. GREGORY:  But the question is still, how do you--even a New York model, you're not dealing with Congress.  Isn't it easier said than done to say from the outside, ""Hey, get in there and roll Congress, tell the far left and the far right that they're both irrational""?"
346,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  You know, this--there's no easy jobs in the world, and particularly in the politically charged world that we live in with the constant scrutiny of the press and the lack of bill--of funds to go ahead. But, you know, that's the job.  And I think the president is personally capable of doing it, and I think he is doing it.  I think we don't give him enough credit.  I have said he should go around the world and, and sell our products.  He was in India.  I--he negotiated a trade deal with Korea, which I think will be great for our manufacturers who
will sell to Korea, and gre at for the consumers who will buy stuff from Korea."
347,"I've said that he should get more business experience on--in his advisers. Why?  Well, I--well, I come from the business background, so of course I would think that.  But you, you read the papers, he's talking to Roger Altman, somebody I was told in the--saw in the paper was being
considered.  He'd be perfect.  There are other people like that who can give him a broader perspective, and I think the perspective of somebody who's actually had to get up in the morning and sweep the floors before his employees can--came in, and locked the door afterwards, and worry about how to make the, the payroll is exactly the kind of experience that he should have himself, or if he doesn't have it, because nobody's going to have all experiences, get other people that have that they can tell him and say, ""You know, what you're talking about is theoretical.  Let me tell you the real world."" Unless you've done everything, which you can't do, you don't know everything.  But you can have advisers that can give--tell you what the real world is about."
348,"MR. GREGORY:  And before you go, is Cliff Lee the key to a world championship for the Yankees? "
349,"MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  You know, as they say, hope springs eternal.  My job before I leave office, and I've only got three seasons to do it, is to have a Subway Series.  Giuliani had a Subway Series.  I'd had a World Series, had a, a Super Bowl win, haven't had a subway series yet. "
350,"MR. GREGORY:  We'll wait and see.  Mayor Bloomberg, thanks, as always."
351,MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Thanks for having me.
352,"MR. GREGORY:  Up next, course correcting.  After the midterms, what does the president's tax deal with Republicans say about the prospect for bipartisanship over the next two years?  And what damage will the deal do to the president's relationship with his liberal base?  We'll ask our
roundtable: Democratic congressman from New York Anthony Weiner; former congressman from Tennessee, Democrat Harold Ford; editorial page editor for The Wall Street Journal, Paul Gigot; and NBC News White House correspondent Savannah Guthrie, after this brief station break."
353,(Announcements)
354,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We're back now, joined by our roundtable:  NBC News White House correspondent, co-host of MSNBC's ""The Daily Rundown,"" Savannah Guthrie; editorial page editor of The Wall Street Journal, Paul Gigot; Democratic congressman from New York, Anthony Weiner; and former congressman from Tennessee, Democrat Harold Ford."
355,"Welcome to all of you.  All right, we've talked about the substance, we've talked about the impact on the economy.  I do want to talk about the politics of tax cuts this week and the president's difficulties with his liberal base."
356,"Savannah Guthrie, really something extraordinary on Friday.  President Clinton comes to meet with President Obama.  They meet privately, presumably to get some advice.  And then a funny thing happens on the way to the exit, and that is they find their way into the briefing room. And, and watching the scene unfold was great Washington theater.  Here was a portion of it."
357,"(Videotape, Friday)"
358,"PRES. OBAMA:  I'm going to let him speak very briefly, and then I've actually got to go over and do some--just one more Christmas party.  So he may decide he wants to take some questions, but I wanted to make sure that you guys heard from him directly."
359,FMR. PRES. BILL CLINTON:  Thank you.
360,PRES. OBAMA:  Thank you.
361,"PRES. CLINTON:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  First of all, I feel awkward being here, and now you're going to leave me all by myself?"
362,"PRES. OBAMA:  Here's what I'll say, is I've been keeping the first lady waiting for about half an hour, so I'm going to take off.  But..."
363,"PRES. CLINTON:  And I, I don't want to make her mad.  Please go."
364,"PRES. OBAMA:  You're in good hands.  And, and Gibbs'll call last question. Thank you."
365,"PRES. CLINTON:  Yeah, help me.  Thank you."
366,"(To reporter) Yeah, go ahead."
367,(End videotape)
368,"MR. GREGORY:  Savannah Guthrie, what I love is that I didn't sense the awkwardness that Bill Clinton felt or that he expressed."
369,MS. SAVANNAH GUTHRIE:  Yes.
370,"MR. GREGORY:  What was behind that?  And what good did it do them, do they think?"
371,"MS. GUTHRIE:  Well, it may not surprise you, having watched that, that this was not something that was planned over a series of days.  This was as ad hoc as it gets.  In fact, when the two presidents came down to the press briefing room, they found it locked, had to go back, were wandering around trying to get into the briefing room.  They ran into press
secretary Gibbs and they said, ""We're looking to talk to some reporters."" And he said, ""Give me five minutes."""
372,"Look, they had this meeting, it was long scheduled.  The president had called President Clinton after the midterms to express his thanks for what he'd done in the campaigns.  They scheduled this meeting.  Frankly, until they had this meeting, the White House and White House aides
weren't 100 percent sure where former President Clinton stood on the tax deal.  Having met in the Oval Office 90 minutes, the two presidents decided amongst themselves to come out and do this news conference.  And I think, especially in a week in which the left wing of the party was so disappointed with the president, to have this former president, considered the most successful Democratic president in modern history, come out and ratify the deal, validate it..."
373,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
374,MS. GUTHRIE:  ...they felt it was well worth it.
375,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Congressman Weiner, look, he was speaking to you.  I mean, you have been outspoken in your opposition to this tax compromise. And to have the president, the former president up there to synthesize the deal, to make the case for it, this is in part what he said to opponents like yourself."
376,"(Videotape, Friday)"
377,"PRES. CLINTON:  Look, if we had five percent growth and unemployment was dropping like a rock, maybe you could have the so-called Mexican standoff and you could say, ""It'll be you, not me, the voters will hold responsible for raising taxes on middle class people if they all go down, you know, next year."" That is not the circumstance we face."
378,(End videotape)
379,"MR. GREGORY:  His point, this is not the time to fight in the way that you wanted the president to."
380,"REP. ANTHONY WEINER (D-NY):  Well, since he officiated my wedding, I think I'm constitutionally prohibited from disagreeing with him.  But one of the things that President Clinton being there reminded us is the difference in the attitude that the White House took with the Gingrich Congress when he was there.  He stood up and fought for the values of the
Democratic Party, fought for what we, what we cared for and made the Congress, the Republican-led Congress, the reason that the, that the country came to a standstill with the government shutdown. "
381,"Look, many of us have been saying that we want the president to succeed. And it's simply a question of this:  In these times, when the middle class is under so much pressure, when debt is approaching $14 trillion dollars, can we really afford to give millionaires $160,000 tax cut?
That's really the big question here.  And I think that now you saw Mr. Goolsbee, the president, even President Clinton all agree that the answer is no, yet that doesn't seem to be the fight that we had in Washington. "
382,"MR. GREGORY:  In the end, do you vote against this?"
383,"REP. WEINER:  Well, I think the entire House of Representatives on the Democratic side has said we're not going for this deal.  I believe in a couple of things.  One, we have to get something done to make sure the taxes go down on the middle class, and two, it has to be done quickly. So now we're going our job in Congress.  We're going to change this, and we're going to--hopefully the president's going to back us up as we try to take out the worst things that are in it."
384,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman, how do you see it?"
385,"FMR. REP. HAROLD FORD JR. (D-TN):  This position that Anthony's taking is the one that was rejected on November 2nd.  As much as I believe that all taxes should go up on every American to some small extent, we're dealing with a different Congress and a different reality.  In comparison to President Clinton when he lost in '94, remember, unemployment was not at
10 percent. The kind of whipping that we took as Democrats in the Congress was not as large and as grave as it was just a few weeks ago.  I think the president should lean more into this agreement.  We got everything we wanted.  We got the cuts for the middle class, we got a
payroll tax cut, we got an acceleration of business tax cuts.  We even have extended some of the other tax cuts that the president wanted, and in addition, 13 months of unemployment compensation.  The only thing that we added was the cuts for the top earners. Now that's less than a quarter of the spending.  If you look at the bulk of the spending, the additional debt spending here, the majority of it is for the middle class cuts which I support.  Now, if we had 65 votes in the Senate, 300 in the House, I think Anthony's point would be the one that would be followed. But President Clinton said it very well.  There--this is no time for a Mexican standoff.  The challenges we face are grave, the agreement reached by this president and Republicans is a good one.  It could have been worse.  And, frankly, I think the president should be prouder of it and use different language to support it."
386,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but, Paul Gigot, the question is to you, does this signal an actual shift in the president's philosophy about what's going to make the economy work again?"
387,"MR. PAUL GIGOT:  Well, they're saying, ""No, no, no.  No, shift."" However, implicitly, it is a shift.  I love the symbolism of two Democratic presidents--not one, but two--endorsing Bush tax cuts, saying, ""We need them crucially to help the economy."" The president, I think, is
implicitly admitting that tax rates matter.  After a couple of years, as you showed on the--with the, the discussion with Austan Goolsbee and Tim Geithner had said, ""They don't matter."" We--now they're saying, yes, they do matter, and then implicitly admitting that tax cuts matter more for growth than spending.  And it makes you wonder why didn't they do this two years ago."
388,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
389,"Congressman, you heard from Mayor Bloomberg.  To the left, the president should say, ""Suck it up.  You got to take the longer view here."" I gather that didn't sit well with you."
390,"REP. WEINER:  No, I--look, I--it depends on what your philosophy is.  I'm not a member of the tail-between-my-legs wing of the Democratic Party.  I believe we still fight for the things we care about.  And I believe this..."
391,MR. GREGORY:  You think the president is?
392,"REP. WEINER:  Well, here's what I will say.  This is not a fringe element of the debate that's gone on in the last 10 years.  This is the very crux of it. The middle class is getting crushed while the very-well-to-do have done remarkably, remarkably well.  You know, I did a little math on the back of an envelope here on the way in.  Three percent of the beneficiaries of this--of the tax cuts are going to get 38 percent of the cash.  It's just not fair. And also something else.  You know, you cannot say you are concerned about the debt and the deficit and support giving giant tax cuts on the estate--on estates of billionaires.  Or giant tax cuts to millionaires.  It's just inconsistent.  So I believe you fight for the values.  And today, with a majority in the House, the majority in the Senate, and we control the presidency and we're acting like we have a weak hand.  We have the right side of the issues and the numbers, and I
don't know why should--we don't fight more."
393,"MR. GREGORY:  It's a question of timing, Savannah, too.  Why it is that the president put himself in this position to have to negotiate out of such weakness and what's going to be different in 2012, another political year, for him to think he's going to be able to prevail in this argument?"
394,"MS. GUTHRIE:  Well, on this latter question, you heard Austan Goolsbee basically make the argument, ""We think the economy will be in a better position."" They are banking everything on that because they think they'll be able to say, ""Look, now we can afford to see those tax rates rise on the wealthiest Americans."" One of the most potent arguments against letting those wealthiest Americans' tax cuts expire.  On the Republican side was, ""It will imperil the recovery.  You can never raise tax in a recession."" I think the president has not backed off his position of being against the tax cuts, you know, rolling back the tax cuts for the wealthiest.  I think the point is he's staring at the barrel of a gun. These tax rates are going up in January, and he's not going to take that gamble.  And that's why he made this deal.  The question is..."
395,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
396,"MS. GUTHRIE:  ...six months ago, why didn't Democrats in the House force this issue.  Why didn't they make it a campaign issue, as some liberals members of the, the caucus wanted to?"
397,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
398,"REP. FORD:  Democrats probably should have done that, and I supported them doing that.  But, but, Paul, in fairness, y'all wrote a great editorial, and it was funny in some ways saying President Bush should have been on the panel, been up there with President Obama and, and
Clinton.  The reality is, one of the reasons we're in the mess that we're in, is that we passed Medicare prescription drug plan without paying for it, which President Bush did."
399,MR. GIGOT:  I was opposed.
400,"REP. FORD:  You wouldn't ask him to be up on the panel on that one. We're fighting two wars that we have not paid for, as much as they're noble causes and noble ends to, and I got to think we're going to have a strategic reassessment of whether or not Afghanistan should continue. But President Obama has a unique opportunity now to reduce the debt.  I hope The Wall Street Journal and others will ask the, the Paul Ryans of the world, will ask the Jeb Hensarlings of the world to support responsible, responsible tax increases..."
401,MR. GIGOT:  We're in favor of...(unintelligible).
402,"REP. FORD:  ...and responsible spending cuts.  You cannot be for just cutting spending and not raising taxes at some level.  I think this president might have had a stronger hand had he just said, ""You know, we're going to raise taxes on everybody, and I'm going to stand firm.""
But since he chose not to do that, which I'm glad he did not..."
403,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
404,"REP. FORD:  ...I think it's the right thing to do, and I think that Anthony and others will come around and find a way to support this guy's bill."
405,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let me, let me--quickly, and then I want to get a break in, Paul..."
406,MR. GIGOT:  Yeah.
407,"MR. GREGORY:  ...what about, you know, Peter Orszag's point, which is all of them--all of these tax cuts are simply unaffordable, and in two years, they ought to all go away."
408,"MR. GIGOT:  Right.  No.  No, I don't, I don't agree with that."
409,MR. GREGORY:  You don't agree.
410,"MR. GIGOT:  Look, I'd love to see a larger tax reform..."
411,"MR. GREGORY:  Right, which the president has talked about wanting to do."
412,"MR. GIGOT:  ...because all this really does, all this, this deal really does is extend the status quo.  So that's not terrific.  It's going to help avoid a huge hit to the economy in 2011, and that's good, but I'd love to see a larger reform.  Maybe both parties can get together on
that, and maybe that's the kind of debate we'll have going into 2012."
413,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  I want to take a break here.  I want to come back and ask two very, you know, pointed questions.  Is there something of a war between the president and the left, given his comments this week?  And what does this deal say about the next couple of years in
Washington in terms of bipartisanship?  More from our roundtable after this quick break."
414,(Announcements)
415,MR. GREGORY:  We're back with more from our roundtable because they just keep talking even during the break.  You got to hear all of this.
416,"Congressman Weiner, to hear the president say it this week, he is irritated with liberals in his party.  And, as he talked about this deal and he talked about the criticism on the left, he said it was like a return to the debate over health care and the public option.  And his point was, ""Look, I could have stuck to my guns on that and then we wouldn't have had healthcare reform at all."" Listen to how he put it. "
417,"(Videotape, Tuesday)"
418,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  So this notion that somehow, you know, we are willing to compromise too much reminds me of the debate that we had during health care. This is the public option debate all over again. "
419,"And we will be able to feel good about ourselves and sanctimonious about how pure our intentions are and how tough we are.  And, in the meantime, the American people are still seeing themselves not able to get health insurance because of pre-existing condition."
420,(End videotape)
421,"MR. GREGORY:  That's his view.  In Congress this week, you were leading a chant that said, ""No we can't,"" not ""Yes, we can."" This is a real standoff."
422,"REP. WEINER:  Well, first of all, I wasn't leading any such chant.  But, look, let me, let me just say this, that the president has to understand that critique that he gets from his base and his supporters who want him to succeed is fundamentally different from the one they get from Mitch McConnell.  We're trying to help him be successful, and I kind of agree with him, this is like the public option.  If he would have fought harder for that, we would have had it.  You know, I think that we need--the president needs to understand that there's an enormous number of us who are just waiting to be called to kind of really have this competition of ideas.  We really need to have this contest. And, you know, look, he made a deal.  It doesn't necessarily mean it's a great one.  We, in Congress, now have it.  We're trying to improve upon it.  But we're on his team. That's the fundamental difference he needs to understand. When he calls us sanctimonious and says this is like past debates, all--the only reason, the only reason that it's like past debates is we still want him to be the president that we elected.  And we're going to help him do that. And if he digs in and he fights for these values, he's going to
find the American people support it, and we, his supporters, are really going to rally to his side."
423,"MR. GREGORY:  You know, Harold, the question was, was this a Sister Souljah moment, to go back to the Clinton era, for President Obama, standing up to the base?"
424,"REP. FORD:  Look, I think it's a moment where he's standing up for America and standing up for jobs.  Look, I like Anthony, respect him a lot, but to suggest that the president doesn't fight a lot, we had a fight, we had an outcome declared on November 2nd.  Now, he has fought and fought and fought, and frankly, has given Democrats in the Congress the ball to run every time. Unfortunately, the American people, whether it's a communications problem, and I don't think it is.  It's hard to communicate effectively when we have 9.8 percent unemployment, and have people rally around you.  The reality is we've done that before.  The president's move last week was an important move for the American people; and, at the end of the day, if unemployment begins to drop over the next quarter or two by a quarter point, every Democrat, including Anthony and others, will say, ""This was the right thing to do.  Now we have to look at the next step in reducing the debt and ensuring that we create jobs."
425,"MR. GREGORY:  But the larger question, Savannah, is, what does this say about how this president wants to do business in Washington over the next couple of years?"
426,"MS. GUTHRIE:  Well, what's fascinating about this is, I don't know that there was a ton of strategy going into this.  I think as, again, it was dictated by circumstances, they had to make a deal, they felt they had to.  But perhaps they stumbled upon a strategy, which is to draw out the partisans on both sides and stake out this middle ground.  And that news conference on Tuesday was so remarkable in the sense that it seemed to me to be the most authentic view of President Obama we've seen.  This seemed to me to be the closest approximation of the man behind closed doors being forceful and compelling. But, interestingly, all that fight, all
that vim and vigor, was directed toward the left of his own party.  And you can see that he's incredibly frustrated by that.  It's almost as though he thinks Republicans, ""Well, gosh, I expected them to oppose me."" "
427,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
428,"MS. GUTHRIE:  ""But where's the love?  Why aren't Democrats, why isn't the left in my own party supporting me when I'm out there bleeding on things like health care, things that have been articles of faith in the Democratic Party for years."""
429,"MR. GREGORY:  The--there--Paul Gigot, there was a--one conservative who's been talked a lot about, The Washington Post's Charles Krauthammer, the columnist who apparently the White House loves now, at least this week, because he wrote the following, which is much more complimentary of Obama and where he's going in the next couple of years.  He writes this:  ""At
great cost that will have to be paid after this newest free lunch, this package will add as much as 1 percent to GDP and lower the unemployment rate by about 1.5 percentage points, That could easily be the difference between victory and defeat in 2012."
430,"""Obama's no fool,"" he writes.  ""While getting Republicans to boost his reelection chances, he gets them to make a mockery of their newfound, second-chance, post-Bush, Tea-Party, this-time-we're-serious persona of debt-averse fiscal responsibility."""
431,"MR. GIGOT:  Well, that's a little overstated, but I think Charles is right that this is a victory for the president.  I mean, it's going to help the economy by not having a huge tax increase.  I don't think it's going to be that great a stimulus, but the economy right now has some momentum.  This makes sure that we're not going to stop that momentum and send the economy back into recession.  But on when it comes to--so it is going to help him, no question about it.  It also going to--helps Republicans, though, honor a campaign promise.  So they get to do that. But I'll tell you, there are a lot of Republicans who aren't thrilled with this deal because they had to give up a lot..."
432,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
433,"MR. GIGOT:  And they--they'd love to see the House Democrats defeat this, because they'll come back in January and say, ""We'll clean up the mess. You'll be responsible for the tax increase, we'll get a better deal for our voters."""
434,"REP. WIENER:  But it's also the only thing that the Republicans really wanted coming out of this campaign.  We know what they're against. They're against health care, they're against a lot of things the Democrats did the last couple of years.  The only things they really wanted they now got.  They've got them. So where does the leverage come now?  You know, the estate tax was going to lapse in January, it's going to go down much..."
435,MR. GIGOT:  Sure.
436,REP. WEINER:  That's where the leverage ultimately was for the president on that.  We gave away that and then some.  The only question... 
437,MR. GIGOT:  But he needed to get--he needed to do that to get some of the other tax stuff.
438,"REP. WEINER:  But, but here's the thing, and I just want to make sure we understand this.  Every one of the economists the president rolled out and supported this plan, every one of them said the tax cuts on the upper brackets and the estate tax do virtually zero on the stimulus side to add to that growth.  Those were the giveaways to the Republicans.  So the
question is this, when did the fight happen, did the full-throated fight happen?  Harold is a hundred percent wrong if you think it happened during the campaign.  The president gave a grand total of one speech in October in Ohio where he even mentioned it.  Between the time of the State of the Union and the election, this, this--our primary point of difference with the Republicans is the priorities.  We defend..."
439,"REP. FORD:  But, but..."
440,"REP. WEINER:  We defend the middle class, they defend the rich, and we essentially backed away from that fight."
441,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
442,"REP. FORD:  Anthony, your position was defeated roundly November 2nd. I'm a Democrat, I'm a proud Democrat.  But more importantly, I'm a proud American. The president, for the first time in the eyes of many Americans, particularly independents who voted for him, said, ""You know
what, we're going to strike a deal."" I got everything I wanted.  I don't know of anything in this tax deal that we didn't get as Democrats that we wanted.  And what did he do?  He extended the cuts for the top earners. Now, remember, we lost an election. If we had gained 60 seats, then what you're saying, you wouldn't have to be here.  There'd be a huge agreement, broad agreement, around what you're saying.  The reality is, the big winners yesterday and the day before and the day before that are the American people"
443,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
444,REP. FORD:  ...because government is working again.
445,"MR. GREGORY:  Savannah, 20 seconds.  Has the president redefined himself? Is there a pragmatism about his politics now that we see over the next couple of years?"
446,"MS. GUTHRIE:  Well, I'll say this, aides say he's always been this guy. Remember, back in the primaries..."
447,"MR. GREGORY:  It's not how he's been seen, though."
448,"MS. GUTHRIE:  Correct.  But on the left, they liked Edwards.  That was their candidate, not Barack Obama.  And once he became the nominee, aides say, look, people projected all manner of things on him.  They say he's just being true to who he is, progressive pragmatist, and that's the president you'll see."
449,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We are going to leave it there.  Thank all of you for a heated discussion, an interesting discussion."
450,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Before we go this morning, we want to take a moment to remember Elizabeth Edwards, who was laid to rest yesterday next to her late son, Wade.  Before a crowd of hundreds of mourners gathered at her church in Raleigh yesterday, Mrs.  Edwards was praised for her strength, wit and grace. The 61-year-old wife of former Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards died Tuesday after a six-year battle with breast cancer.  She was a political force in her own right, an attorney, author and a fighter for healthcare reform.  Our thoughts and prayers are with her surviving children and her loved ones. "
451,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  That is all for today.  We'll be back next week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

This Sunday, closing strong. The president prevails on some big votes during the 
lame duck session
 of 
Congress
. The ban on gays and lesbians in the 
military
 has been lifted, and the president claims 
victory
 on a tax deal with 
Republicans

PRES. BARACK OBAMA:
The final product proves when we can put aside the partisanship and the 
political
 games, when we can put aside what's good for some of us in favor of what's good for all of us, we can get a lot done.

"

MR. GREGORY:
So what will it mean for the 
economy
 and jobs? And what is the 
political
 fallout for 
2012
? The 
Afghanistan war
 grinds on, but to what end? How many 
troops
 will come home next summer? And what are the administration's priorities for the new year? This morning, an exclusive interview with the vice president of the

Washington
 will change in

Announcer:
From 
NBC News
 in 
Washington
, 
MEET THE PRESS
 with 
David Gregory
.
"
8,"
MR. GREGORY:
Good morning. A busy Saturday in the 
Senate
 as eight 
Republicans
 joined with 
Democrats
 to end the ban on gays and lesbians in the 
military
. Democratic sponsors of the 
Dream Act
 immigration bill, however, fell several votes short of the 60 needed to overcome Republican opposition. Still unsettled, the fate of the new 
START treaty
, the 
nuclear arms
treaty
 with 
Russia
, which will continue to be debated today in a rare Sunday session. Late Friday I sat down with the man who has become the president's point man in dealing with 
Congress
, the vice president of the 
United States
, 
Joe Biden
. Mr. Vice President, welcome back to 
MEET THE PRESS
.
"
9,"
VICE PRES. JOE BIDEN:
Good to be back.
"
10,"
MR. GREGORY:
Good to have you here. And it's an important time. The end of the week saw you and the president closing a very important deal, this 
compromise
 over an extension of the 
Bush
-era 
tax cuts
, a bill signing at the 
White House
, striking in that you had a Republican there...
"
11,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Yeah.
"
12,"
MR. GREGORY:
...
Mitch McConnell
, 
for the first time
. So a new era, perhaps, in 
Washington
. The 
bottom line
 is the focus on getting people back to work. What does this deal mean to the end of that goal?
"
13,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
This means two things. 
Number
 one, every econometric model, every basic economist out there says, look, this is going to grow the 
economy
 faster next year than it would have. The projections are instead of the 
economy
 growing at a -- the 
GDP
 growing at a roughly 2.5 percent, some suggest it would grow as high as 4 percent. That means employment. That means more people employed, 
number
 one. 
Number
 two, this wasn't just extending the 
Bush
-era 
tax cuts
. It extended all the 
tax cuts
 for the 
middle class
 and all the 
tax cuts
 for the poor that were in our legislation, the 
Obama
 legislation. We came up with a 
tax cut
 of two percent for everybody who gets a payroll check, and on their -- not the employer, the employee gets a two percent. For example, someone making $60 grand a year is going to get another $1,200 on top of the 
middle
-class 
tax cut
. We continued all those 
tax cuts
 for the 
working poor
, the so-called 
EITC
, 
earned income
tax credits
, and maybe most importantly, were able to extend for another 13 months 
unemployment insurance
 for those devastated by this recession.
"
14,"
MR. GREGORY:
What about the prospect of eliminating uncertainty? In what may be the first salvo of the 
2012
 campaign, 
Mitt Romney
 said, ""Look, this really doesn't solve the problem. This is not good for the 
economy
 because businesses understand that in a couple of years these rates are going back up.""
"
15,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
No. 
Look
, here's the -- businesses don't care about the top-end 
tax cut
 except those people making a 
million
 bucks. They're the ones that care. What the businesses care about are the extension of all of those 
tax cuts
 for business that we extended, the so-called extenders. For example, we provided for 100 percent expensing. The guy run -- runs a contracting company, he goes buy a $50,000 backhoe, he can expense it in one year now. That's going to encourage him to go out, invest, buy, build. And so all of those we hope we're going to be able to continue. The one target for us in two years is no longer extending the upper 
income tax
 credit for millionaires and billionaires, and scaling back what we had to do to get the 
compromise
, the 
estate tax
 for the very wealthy.
"
16,"
MR. GREGORY:
But the president has said he thinks he can win this argument on the merits in...
"
17,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
I think he can.
"
18,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, then why not do it now? Why wait until 
2012
, an 
election
 year? Do you really expect, in an 
election
 year, that anybody's not going to vote to extend the 
tax cuts
?
"
19,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Yeah, I do. I do.
"
20,"
MR. GREGORY:
What'll be different?
"
21,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Well, I think what'll be different is that we will have had the outcome of the 
deficit
commission
, we will be able to make the case much more clearly that spending $700 billion over 10 years to extend 
tax cuts
 for people whose income averages well over a 
million
dollars
 does not make sense, 
number
 one. 
Number
 two, we're not going to be -- we're not in a position, 
David
, where we're going to have, 
God willing
, the shaky 
economy
 where we could not afford to continue uncertainty for a month or two or three in the next year had we not made a deal which would actually grow the 
economy
. The, the obverse was equally as true. Had we kicked this into next year, it would have created such uncertainty, and there are a 
number
 of economists who thought that it would -- may, in fact, induce a double-dip recession. So we not only avoided it getting worse, we made it -- the prospects much better for the 
economy
.
"
22,"
MR. GREGORY:
The, the irony of achieving this tax deal is that it does represent a broken promise by this president in how he campaigned, and how you campaigned as well. 
In September
 you were interviewed by my colleague 
Rachel Maddow
, and you had an exchange about this fight over extending the 
tax cut
 for wealthier 
Americans
. Let me play a portion of that.
"
23,"

"
24,"
MS. RACHEL MADDOW:
Does that mean that letting the 
Bush tax cuts
 expire for the 
richest people
 in the 
country
 while pushing for their extension, a 
middle
-class 
tax cut
 for 
everybody else
, is that a 
black and white
 issue? Is that a -- we haven't 
heard
 a veto threat, for example, from the president on that.
"
25,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
No, it, it is a 
black and white
...
"
26,"
MS. MADDOW:
Is -- it's a 
black and white
 issue. That's something that the administration's going to go to the mat for.
"
27,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
It's a 
black and white
 issue. Yes, absolutely.
"
28,"

"
29,"
MR. GREGORY:
That was September.
"
30,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
By the way, we did...
"
31,"
MR. GREGORY:
By January, you didn't go to the mat.
"
32,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
By the -- we did go to the mat. We did go to the mat. We went through every -- I went into a total of 130 races out there campaigning for 
Democrats
. Every single race I made this case. Here's what happened. We got to the end, we couldn't get it done, and we had
"
33,"
to make a decision:
Were we going to let the 
middle
-class 
tax cuts
 expire? Let me remind everybody, the 
House
 passed 
middle
-class 
tax cut
 only. It got to the 
United States Senate
, we supported that provision, and the 
Senate
 could not pass it. So now we're left with, do we let those folks who are 
going to bed
 tonight staring at a ceiling wondering whether they're going to be in that same bed next month, or those two 
million
 people who already lost their 
unemployment insurance
 this month, seven 
million
 more losing it next month, and economic uncertainty occur? Life is a matter of really tough choices.
"
34,"
MR. GREGORY:
The president wrote in ""
Audacity of Hope
"" that he found the 
Bush tax cuts
 for the wealthy morally troubling.
"
35,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
They are.
"
36,"
MR. GREGORY:
Is that still his belief?
"
37,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
It's still his belief.
"
38,"
MR. GREGORY:
Your belief as well?
"
39,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Mine as well.
"
40,"
MR. GREGORY:
But you're 
willing
 to 
compromise
 on that?
"
41,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Look, it's -- the idea -- to 
compromise
 to save people who are drowning -- there's people out there drowning. There are two 
million
 people this month that can't afford to go get a 
Christmas tree
, let alone buy any gifts, because their unemployment has run out, which means they've been unemployed for well over a year to two years. It is unfortunate we were put in the position where the 
Republicans
 made it clear they were ready to let everything fall unless they got these 
tax cuts
. They're for two years. They're for two years, and we're coming back and going at it again.
"
42,"
MR. GREGORY:
Can you be thought of as being serious about cutting the 
deficit
 when 80 -- within 80 hours of, of announcing the 
deficit
commission
's proposals this administration agrees to add a trillion 
dollars
 to the 
deficit
?
"
43,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Absolutely, positively. Look what the 
deficit
commission
 suggested. They suggested we do exactly what we did. They suggested we have a 
payroll tax
. They suggested that we stimulate the 
economy
 this year into next year. They suggested that this has no 
impact
 on long-term debt because it's for two years. Look, you know this, the only people who are going to agree with me when I say this are the economists listening, left, right and center. In the 
middle
 of a recession, where we're just climbing out of it, where the 
economy
 -- unemployment is still at 9.7 percent, the idea of raising taxes and reducing spending is a prescription for disaster. No one is suggesting that.
"
44,"
MR. GREGORY:
Is the balance -- to that point, do we think the balance is out of whack? There's so much attention on austerity...
"
45,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Yeah.
"
46,"
MR. GREGORY:
...on cutting the 
deficit
. And yet, 
Larry Summers
, the president's outgoing top economic adviser...
"
47,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Yeah.
"
48,"
MR. GREGORY:
...saying, look, at this particular moment in time, the priority next year should be more spending. You're the shovel-ready projects guy. There should be more 
investment
 in infrastructure. Should there, should there be more of that before we really focus on bringing down the 
deficit
?
"
49,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
We can do both. Let me explain what I mean. In the 
budget
 we submitted and the omnibus or the, or the, the, the -- I'm sorry to sound like a senator here, or a wonk. But in the spending proposal for next year, we freeze 
discretionary spending
. Freeze it. Freeze it. We think we have to start by all those things that have tails on them, the long-term 
impact
, we should not be spending in those areas and we should be freezing or reducing. On those issues that have no long-term 
deficit
 -- look, the entire recovery bill -- 
I know you know
 this, but the entire recovery act of the last 18 months, over roughly $800 billion, you know how much it added to the long-term debt? Two-tenths of one percent to 
GDP
. Two-tenths of one percent. The places where we have to go are those things that have tails, that are long-term commitments to the 
government
. That's where the problem is, and that's what we have to attack.
"
50,"
MR. GREGORY:
You brought up spending and I want to talk about this earmark issue, not to sound wonkish, these are the pet projects that lawmakers...
"
51,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
No. Yeah.
"
52,"
MR. GREGORY:
...put into the 
budget
; and you had a lot of back and forth here, and ultimately 
Democrats
 had a defeat. They pulled back their big spending bill, eliminated the 
earmarks
. And yet, 
Harry Reid
, the leader of the 
Democrats
, took on the 
White House
, wasn't
"
53,"
happy with all of this and said this, this week:
I am convinced that I do not want to give up more power to the 
White House
, whether it's 
George Bush
 or 
Barack Obama.
And I
'm going to fight as hard as I can against 
President Obama
 on these 
earmarks
 and my Republican colleagues who hate to vote for them, but love to get them.
"
54,"

"
55,"
SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV):

Bottom line
 is, if there is some temporary measure to keep the 
government
 funded, will the president down the road veto a bill that includes 
earmarks
 or not?
"
56,"

"
57,"
MR. GREGORY:

David
, if the question is, in order to keep the patient alive, we have to use medicine we don't like, we may have to do it. I'm not going to second -- 
if...

"
58,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
But the president said he regretted when he's done that in the past.
"
59,"
MR. GREGORY:

Well...

"
60,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
He regretted signing a bill with 
earmarks
...
"
61,"
MR. GREGORY:

Well...

"
62,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
...and that after the 
election
 it was a new day.
"
63,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, look, in this 
budget
 that was -- is being debated for -- to keep the 
government
 running for the next month and year, there is a freeze in 
discretionary spending
. Also, there is an increase in spending for our 
troops
 that are in the 
middle
 of a war. Those two things we think are essential. Now, if you say to me, do we have to accept a project in -- and by the way, there were six Republican appropriators who supported this who had 
earmarks
 in it. If we say we have to support a, a levy in 
Mississippi
 in order to make sure my kid, who's out in the 
middle
 of 
Iraq
 or 
Afghanistan
 gets what he needs, I'm going to say yeah. I don't want to do it, but I may have to do it. It depends on the proportions. It depends on what to say. 
Harry
 just reinforced the point we've been making. We don't like 
earmarks
. You have the Democratic leader criticizing the president of the 
United States
 because we say we don't want 
earmarks
.
"
64,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
So, so you may not like it, but there's no veto threat.
"
65,"
MR. GREGORY:
No, there -- it depends on the proportion. It could be very well that you wind up in a situation where you say, ""OK, in order to be able to have the funding for the continuation, the support for the 
troops
 in 
Afghanistan
, we have to accept an earmark, and that's what the 
Congress
 sends us."" Are we going to veto a bill that will jeopardize troop safety? Probably not. Conversely, if there's a bunch of 
earmarks
 in a bill that we think is funding for several agencies that we're 
willing
 to fight over and can take a chance on losing on, yeah, we'll veto.
"
66,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
I want to button up a couple of other very important agenda items in this 
lame duck session
.
"
67,"
MR. GREGORY:
Sure.
"
68,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
As we sit here today, it looks like a repeal of the ban on gays and lesbians serving in the 
military
 will be successful. It will be repealed.
"
69,"
MR. GREGORY:
We hope so.
"
70,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
That, that is, as we sit here today, how it looks. What will be the 
impact
 of that happening?
"
71,"
MR. GREGORY:
The 
impact
, 
David
, is we'll be in line with seven other of our allies around the world. We will not be squandering the abilities of combat soldiers as well as interpreters who happen to have a different sexual preference, who happen to be gay or happen to be lesbian. Look, all of our major allies have, for some time now, provided for all -- the 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff
, the secretary of the 
Defense
, the vast majority of the 
American people
 say you're -- whether you are gay or straight, it does not affect whether you can shoot straight or whether you can speak 
Urdu
.
"
72,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
What about the 
START treaty
, the 
nuclear arms
treaty
 with 
Russia
? Do you have the votes as we sit here to get that ratified?
"
73,"
MR. GREGORY:
I believe we do. I believe we do.
"
74,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
So what's holding this up? Is this 
political
 gamesmanship by 
Republicans
 or are there substantive criticisms?
"
75,"
MR. GREGORY:
Both. With some, with 
John McCain
, there are substantive criticisms. He was worried about whether or not we're going to make good on our commitment to deploy all four phases of the 
missile defense system
 in 
Europe.
 We are. That's a legitimate concern. There's other legitimate concerns. There have been 18 hearings, 1,000 questions we've answered and -- but another is they just simply are against any 
arms control
 agreement. That's the category that, when I say any, they're simply against this 
arms control
. Senator 
DeMint
 is absolutely four square against it. It wouldn't matter what it said. And conversely, and there are people like 
Senator McCain
 and leading 
Republicans
 like 
Johnny Isakson
 in 
Georgia
 who think this is a good, substantive thing for 
U.S.
 security. I might add, every former Republican secretary of 
Defense
, secretary of 
State
, 
national security
 adviser, and head of strategic command says this is essential for 
U.S.
 security.
"
76,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Let me move on to 
foreign affairs
. I want to talk about the fallout from the 
WikiLeaks
 scandal. 
Julian Assange
 appeared on the ""Today"" show on Friday morning and he said there are more leaks to come. This is what he told 
Matt Lauer
 in part:
"
77,"
MR. GREGORY:
As we have seen, 
WikiLeaks
 is a robust organization. During my time in solitary confinement in the basement of a 
Victorian
 prison, we continue to release, our media partners continued to write stories. The important revelations from this material continue to come out. We have approximately 2,000 cables into 250,000.
"
78,"

"
79,"
MR. JULIAN ASSANGE:
More to come. Should the 
United States
 do something to stop Mr. 
Assange
?
"
80,"

"
81,"
MR. GREGORY:
We're looking into that right now. The 
Justice Department
 is taking a look at that, and I'm not going to comment on, on that process.
"
82,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Do you think he's a criminal?
"
83,"
MR. GREGORY:
If he conspired to get these classified documents with a member of the 
U.S. military
, that's fundamentally different than if somebody drops on your lap, ""Here, 
David
, you're a press person, here is classified material.""
"
84,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:

Mitch McConnell
 says he's a 
high tech
 terrorist, others say this is akin to the 
Pentagon Papers
. Where do you come down?
"
85,"
MR. GREGORY:
I would argue that it's closer to being a 
high tech
 terrorist than, than the 
Pentagon Papers
. But look, this guy has, has done things that have damaged and, and put into jeopardy the lives and, and occupations of people in other parts of the world. He's made it more difficult for us to conduct our, our business with our allies and our friends. For example, in my meetings, you know I meet with most of these 
world leaders
, there is a desire now to meet with me alone rather than have staff in the room. It makes things more cumbersome. And so it is, it has done damage.
"
86,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Let me ask you about 
Afghanistan
. The president's review released this week, you've been described in 
The New York Times
 as ""
Obama
's in-
house
 pessimist on 
Afghanistan
."" Are we winning or losing in 
Afghanistan
?
"
87,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me separate this out, remind everybody what our goal is. Our overarching goal and our rationale for being there is to defeat and -- to dismantle, ultimately defeat 
al-Qaeda
, residing -- central 
al-Qaeda
 residing in the 
Fatah
, the western regions of the mountains of, of 
Pakistan
. Secondly, to make sure that terrorists do not, in fact, bring down the 
Pakistani government
, which is a 
nuclear power
. Toward that end, we think it's important that there be stability in 
Afghanistan
 so that 
al-Qaeda
 cannot re-establish it as a base from which to attack the 
United States of America.
 With regard to our efforts to degrade 
al-Qaeda
, we're making great 
progress
. The so-called 
C.T.
, that is counterterrorism, the use of 
special forces
 and the like to go after individuals who make up the leadership of 
al-Qaeda
 and of the 
Taliban
. On the issue of counterinsurgency, that is where we clear, hold and build and transfer, we're making 
progress
 not as rapidly as we are on the other 
front
. President's been frank to say that in his release, pointing out that we need two things that we're working on very hard and we're making
"
88,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
one, 
Pakistan
 and safe havens; and two, governance in 
Afghanistan
.
"
89,"
some progress:

All of this
 is so complicated.
"
90,"
MR. GREGORY:
It is.
"
91,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
After 10 years, Mr. Vice President, can't you just say straight whether we're winning of losing?
"
92,"
MR. GREGORY:

Well...

"
93,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Don't the 
American people
 deserve to know something about where we stand?
"
94,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, no -- they -- I, I -- the one thing I've never been accused of is not being straight. They are -- we are making 
progress
.
"
95,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Yeah...
"
96,"
MR. GREGORY:
Are we making sufficient 
progress
 fast enough? The answer remains to be seen. Here's what we said. We said we were going to -- we -- after seven years of neglect of an Afghan policy when we came to office, we had to sit down. I went off to 
Afghanistan
 at the president's request, came back with a recommendation, and said we have to clarify our objectives and then decide what forces we need in order to 
sustain
 the possibility of making sure we accomplish those objectives. We've done that. We said we'd sit down in December and make -- and look at it and review the 
progress
 we're making. We were honest with the 
American people
, we're making 
progress
 in all fronts, more in some areas than in others. We are going to, come July, begin to draw down 
American forces
 and transfer responsibility to the...
"
97,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Will that be a token amount of soldiers? Will it be a couple of thousand 
troops
 and no more?
"
98,"
MR. GREGORY:
No. Well, well -- it, it will not be a token amount, but the degree to which we draw down -- if I can make an analogy to 
Iran
 -- I mean, excuse me, to, to 
Iraq
, which I've been put in charge of.
"
99,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Yeah.
"
100,"
MR. GREGORY:
What happened there? We signed, three years ago, an agreement with the Iraqis saying that what we're going to do is, two summers ago we're going to draw all combat 
troops
 out of the 
cities
, populated areas. Then we said, our administration, we're going to draw 100,000 
troops
 out the next summer. And we're going to be totally out. In the meantime, we're going to help build a 
government
, we're going to transfer responsibility, and we're going to be gone. That's exactly what we did at the recent 
Lisbon
 conference, the 
NATO
 conference, where we said, ""We're starting this process, just like we did in 
Iraq
. We're starting it in July of 
2011
, and we're going to be totally out of there 
come hell or high water
 by 
2014
.""
"
101,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Let me ask you about something that's on a lot of 
Americans
' minds. As we talk about 
Afghanistan
, 
number
 one goal is preventing another terror 
state
 in 
Afghanistan
 from, from where 
terrorist attacks
 can be launched. We know what happened with the 
Christmas Day
 bomber during the holidays last year. What is the capacity of 
al-Qaeda
 or affiliated organizations to pull off a large scale 
terror attack
 against this 
country
?
"
102,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, you never say never, OK? But we are, our 
intelligence community
, is united in the view that the ability of central 
al-Qaeda
, that is 
Osama bin Laden
 and company in the 
Af-Pak
 area, in those mountains, has been significantly degraded, and we don't believe they have the capacity from there to pull of a, a 9/11 type operation. But what has also happened, as you've noticed, you've seen in the 
Arabian peninsula
, you've seen in other parts of the world where there are 
al-Qaeda
, 
al-Qaeda
-related affiliates not under the direct 
control
 of, of 
Osama
, but yet engaged with him. They are planning much smaller-bore but yet deadly attempts to go after the 
United States of America.
 We saw that in the underpants bomber 
last Christmas
, we saw that in the 
Times Square
 effort. So there are going to be continued efforts to be able to, coming, quite frankly, more likely out of places other than the 
Fatah
 -- excuse me, other than 
Pakistan
, where 
bin Laden
 is. But we have significantly degraded and knocked off a lot of the main planners and organizers and trainers. Does that mean we've succeeded? No. Does that mean we're in much better shape than we were a year ago and two and three? Yes.
"
103,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
I want to ask -- let's spend a couple minutes talking about leadership and politics here as we look ahead to 
2011
. You know this town pretty well. You know politics in this town very well. 
President Obama
 has just come through a real tough 
election
. What is the key to turning things around for him?
"
104,"
MR. GREGORY:
The key to turning things around is that having everyone understand the 
message
 of that 
election
. We understand it. The 
message
 is the American public wants us to cooperate, wants us to work together. That's why, if we get the 
START
 agreement, we will have this 
lame duck session
, since the 
election
, 
heard
 the 
message
 and the 
Republicans
 will have 
heard
 the 
message
 that they want us to reasonably 
compromise
 to move the business of the 
nation
 forward as we just did on the 
economy
 with regard to taxes and growth, and as, 
God willing
, we're going to do on 
national security
 with regard to 
START
. 
And I
 think that is the 
message
 of the 
election
.
"
105,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
But don't you -- can't you understand, though, a lot of voters look up at this president and say, you know, ""We're not sure we get him. Is he, is he a liberal, is, is he a moderate, is he a pragmatist? What is he, exactly?""
"
106,"
MR. GREGORY:
What he is, is he is a progressive leader who, in fact, understands that politics is all in the art of the, the possible, and it's critically important to do two things. He
"
107,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Promote 
economic growth
 and keep 
America
 safe. And so, to the extent that he has to make compromises that don't 
compromise
 those two objectives, he will.
"
108,"
knows his job as two overarching responsibilities:
This is not a guy who campaigned saying, ""Look, politics is the art of the possible."" This is someone who campaigned, both of you did, coming to 
Washington
 saying, ""Business is going to change around here.""
"
109,"
MR. GREGORY:

Well...

"
110,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
And that's why so many new voters came into the process. They expected more.
"
111,"
MR. GREGORY:
By, by the way, that's exactly what the president did say, that business was going to change. You remember, I ran against him in, in the primaries. I've always been a little less optimistic about the idea that somehow the 
Republicans
 last year were going to join hands with us. The president reached out. He reached out in every way to the 
Republicans
 last year to say, ""Hey, let's work on 
health care
. 
Let's work
 on this. let's work..."" They made a very calculated decision. You know it and I know it. I'm not -- most people know it. I know it, that they decided that it was in their 
best interest
 to not see much move forward cooperatively and it would hurt the 
Democrats
 because they were in charge. They turned out to be right. But they got a second 
message
. They found out that, that the public didn't like the 
Democrats
, but they sure in the devil didn't like the 
Republicans
 either. And most polls showed they liked the 
Republicans
 less. And so the 
message
 that came out, I believe, and would -- you saw what 
Mitch McConnell
 and 
John Boehner
, both who are friends of mine, who I've worked with for years, they came out of this and say, ""Hm, we better get, get a 
compromise
."" Can you imagine last year, the 
Republicans
 agreeing on a 
compromise
 like the one we had here, where they took things that are religion to them, which are, ""No 
earned income
 tax credit, that's not a tax, that's a giveaway, that -- we're not going to do that."" Guess what? There's $200 billion of that stuff now.
"
112,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
When you look at 
compromise
, does Vice President 
Biden
 become the negotiator-in-chief 
from here on in
? You've got the relationships on the 
Hill
.
"
113,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, by the way, you know, every -- I, I, I get asked that a lot lately since this worked. That's been my role from the beginning. For example, I've repeated -- I've met with -- I, I'm the guy that's gone up on the important issues to the 
House
, and I'm the guy that goes -- I'm vice president of the 
United States
. They know when I speak, I speak for the president. So last year, everybody said, ""
God
, you -- you know, if 
Rahm Emanuel
 were here, he would have been the one going up to the 
House
 and the 
House
 caucus."" Not true. It would have been me, whether he were here or not. Just like it was last year. On three important occasions, I was the guy that went to the 
House
 to try to sell them, and in two cases sold them, on what to do. And look, I have -- one of the things that matters in this town, and you know it as well as I do, your word matters. There's not a single Democrat or Republican who's ever worked with me that will not look you in the eye and say, ""
Biden
 has never, ever, ever broken his word."" So that's why I'm able to go up there. I don't always succeed, but I like these guys, they're my friends. I've got -- a lot of these 
Republicans
 are my friends.
"
114,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
Final question, Mr. Vice President. I know you're a 
Phillies
 fan. I've been talking about the 
Phillies
 a lot here...
"
115,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah.
"
116,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
...
and I
'm a 
Dodgers
 and a 
Nationals
 fan.
"
117,"
MR. GREGORY:
I know, I know.
"
118,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
But I've got to ask you, quickly, are they the odds-on favorite to win the championship with that rotation?
"
119,"
MR. GREGORY:
I think they are. I think they are. I honest to 
God
 think they are.
"
120,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
That's the prediction?
"
121,"
MR. GREGORY:
But last time we spoke, I told you I still thought we had a chance to make it to the series this year. I was obviously wrong about that. But I really do. I mean, and how many people said, ""We'll never, ever, ever sign him""?
"
122,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:

That's right
. We'll leave it there. Mr. Vice President. 
Merry Christmas
.
"
123,"
MR. GREGORY:
Where there's life, there's hope.
"
124,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:

Thank you very much
. Appreciate it.
"
125,"
MR. GREGORY:
Thank you very, very much. Appreciate it.
"
126,"
VICE PRES. BIDEN:
And up next, analysis on the president's leadership as the 
111th Congress
 wraps up its work, and what can we expect from both parties in the new 
Congress

MR. GREGORY:
Coming up, our 
political

 weighs in on how the president scored victories in the week before 
Christmas

Republican House
 will change 
Washington

commercial break
.
"
128,"

"
129,"
MR. GREGORY:
We're back, joined now by our

 and former adviser to 
President George W. Bush
, 
Senator John McCain
, 
Mark McKinnon

; host of

Morning Joe
 himself, former Republican congressman -- I think we all know that by now -- from 
Florida
...
"
130,"

"
131,"
MR. GREGORY:
I'm from 
Florida
. With a tie.
"
132,"
MR. JOE SCARBOROUGH:
Yeah, I think you've mentioned it once, once in a -- with a tie. 
Joe Scarborough
.
"
133,"
MR. GREGORY:
I don't like talking about myself like 
Joe Biden
. I try not to.
"
134,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
And mayor of 
Newark
, 
New Jersey
, Democrat 
Cory Booker
. Welcome to all of you. Good to have all of you. We've got news to talk about, 
Joe Scarborough
. ""Don't_Ask,_Don't_Tell,"" this was a 
significant
 campaign promise by the president. He got it done, that's been lifted. And look at the bipartisan support that he gets here. Look at the 
Republicans
 who voted to lift the ban: 
Scott Brown
 from 
Massachusetts
, but then you got guys like 
Richard Burr
 from 
North Carolina
, 
John Ensign
 from 
Nevada
. Give the president his due here, this is a 
big deal
.
"
135,"
MR. GREGORY:
It's a 
big deal
 for him politically, as well for a lot of 
Americans
 who supported this. This is a president who was forced to go on 
Jon Stewart
 saying, ""Yes, we can, but...""
"
136,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
Mm-hmm.
"
137,"
MR. GREGORY:
It's a president that's had to strike a deal with 
Republicans
, a tax deal that his base loathed. Whether -- 
Joe Biden
 can spin it anyway he wants to spin it. This -- that tax bill was a big loss for the Democratic base and for the president. So this was something the president really needed going 
into the new
 year to explain to his base, ""This is one reason why you elected me.""
"
138,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
And yet, 
Mark McKinnon
, 
John Cornyn
 from 
Texas
, senator, spoke for others like 
Senator McCain
 who said this is going to do a lot of damage. That's what 
Senator

"
139,"
MR. GREGORY:
""With three of the four 
military
 chiefs expressing clear reservations over the proposed repeal of 
Don't Ask
, 
Don't Tell
, today's vote shows blatant disregard for the opinions of those who know our 
military
 best. With our 
troops
 engaged in combat overseas, now is not the time to increase the level of stress on our 
Armed Forces
 through such a dramatic policy change. It's a disgrace that this latest item from the liberal legislative wish-list is being jammed through at the expense of 
military
 readiness.""
"
140,"
McCain said. This is what Cornyn said in a statement that he released:
I strongly disagree with that, 
David
. I think that's the same kind of thing we 
heard
 when we integrated the 
armed forces
 years ago. 
And I
 think, you know, a decade from now we're going to look back on this and just couldn't believe that it took us this long. The tide of history is rolling forward, and the president did the right thing, and so did the 
Republicans
 who 
crossed over
.
"
141,"
MR. MARK McKINNON:
Interesting, though, 
Andrea
, how did they pull it off? Because we -- ""Don't_Ask,_Don't_Tell"" looked like it was dead here, and that they were going to have to suffer this defeat. It came back.
"
142,"
MR. GREGORY:

Joe
 Lieberman, 
Susan Collins
 -- so bipartisan in that regard -- stripping it out of the 
defense
appropriations bill
, a clean bill that came over from the 
House
. And you have to give a lot of credit going back to the passionate and really moral stand taken by 
Mike Mullen
, the admiral who is the chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs
. When he first testified to 
armed services
 and said, ""You cannot ask our uniformed men and women to tell a lie about themselves. That is against the whole conduct of the 
military
 code."" And that principled stand, a little more reluctantly but still going along with it, 
Robert Gates
 saying, ""We, we serve. We will follow the orders."" That outweighed, I think, what the combat -- 
the Marines
 and some of the...
"
143,"
MS. ANDREA MITCHELL:
Right.
"
144,"
MR. GREGORY:
...
front
 line forces were saying.
"
145,"
MS. MITCHELL:
Mayor Booker, as a Democratic leader yourself, you can look at the president's leadership, see what he's accomplished here. He hopes to get the 
START treaty
 ratified as well. And then there is this tax deal, the pros and the cons. This is the president as he signed the bill, laying out what was accomplished, but also what's ahead. Take a look at this.
"
146,"
MR. GREGORY:
Now, candidly speaking, there are some elements of this legislation that I don't like. There's some elements that members of my party don't like. There's some elements that 
Republicans
 here today don't like. That's the nature of 
compromise
. In some ways this was easier than some of the tougher choices we're going to have to make next year. There will be times when we won't agree, and we'll have to work through those times together.
"
147,"

"
148,"
PRES. OBAMA:
What does this deal represent about how this president wants to approach 
Republicans
?
"
149,"

"
150,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, first of all just let me say, back to ""Don't_Ask,_Don't_Tell""...
"
151,"
MAYOR CORY BOOKER (D):
Yeah.
"
152,"
MR. GREGORY:
...this is a, a week where we saw pragmatism prevail. I think it's a moral issue, a just issue when it comes to ""Don't_Ask,_Don't_Tell."" But the reality is, the argument that won was the 
military preparedness
. And so this is another example where pragmatism prevailed. We are in the nadir of our economic life, at least in my lifetime, as a 
nation
. And this is a bill full of things that will immediately benefit our 
economy
. 
And I
 look at my city, not just the expansion of 
unemployment benefits
, which is something that all economists say will help, but more importantly, incentivizing small businesses, which are the real driver in our 
economy
, to create jobs in 
cities
 like mine by giving them 
tax credits
 for investments they make. The 
earned income
 tax credit, giving incentives for education by giving more -- extending the tax benefits for people putting people through -- going through college. All of these things bring real benefits. And, of course, the -- our liberal base might be upset and consider it a, a treason to go against his very firm stance, 
going to the mat
 on the issue of 
tax breaks
 for the wealthy. But the reality is, in its totality, this was a 
victory
 for pragmatism, a 
victory
 for the president; but more importantly, a 
victory
 for people in, in our 
country
.
"
153,"
MAYOR BOOKER:
Well, I -- 
Joe
, you, you 
heard
 the vice president say this is a president who's a progressive but who believes that politics is the art of the possible.
"
154,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
155,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
Is that the new 
President Obama
?
"
156,"
MR. GREGORY:
""Yes, we can, but..."" It, it's the reality. It is the reality that, that the president's had to face up to. I've got to say, though, I've got to, got to take exception with something the president said. He said, you know, we're going to face choices next year that are going to be even tougher. Well, there was nothing tough about this bill. In fact, it's frightening, it straps with -- it straps us with another trillion 
dollars
 worth of debt. Just this summer, in July, the 
CBO
 told the president and 
Congress
, ""If you guys don't 
get your act together
 on the debt, you're going to see our 
credit rating
 go down. That's going to lead to higher interest rates, which will lead to higher debts. It'll lead to bonds collapsing. That could lead to the markets collapsing. It could lead to the 
United States
 looking a lot like 
Ireland
 and 
Greece
."" That was the warning. How did they respond? Adding another trillion 
dollars
 to the debt. And how did 
Moody's
 respond? By saying, ""You know, over the next two years we may have to devalue your 
bond rating
 just like 
Ireland
's."" It's recklessness.
"
157,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
And yet, I -- it seems to me that, that austerity has to wait. I mean, that's what you saw out of this deal was that, that this president wants to do everything he can to somehow move the needle on jobs, you know, in the next -- immediate term.
"
158,"
MR. GREGORY:
That, that's the politics of it. I think 
Joe
 is absolutely right about the long- term because basically they have so raised the level from which you're eventually going to have to cut. So to say that we're going to get serious about 
deficit
 cutting in the future...
"
159,"
MS. MITCHELL:
Mm-hmm.
"
160,"
MR. GREGORY:
...is, is really silly at this point.
"
161,"
MS. MITCHELL:
This happened a week, a week...
"
162,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
Right, a week.
"
163,"
MS. MITCHELL:
...after the debt 
commission
 figured out how to shave $3, $4 trillion, something that added another.
"
164,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
But, but, but you've seen the debate. But, 
Mark
, you see guys like 
Larry Summers
 and others saying, ""Look, we got to 
get the balance right
. We can't move to austerity yet. We got to keep investing in the 
economy
.""
"
165,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, I think that this deal's actually going to put a lot more physics and gravity on, on now doing a real 
deficit
 reduction program and, and 
significant
tax reform
. I think there's great weight now there to bring the parties together. And by the way, I agree with the vice president. He said the 
American people
 want us to cooperate and want us to work together. That's exactly why we started 
No Labels
, because that's what people in 
America
 are saying. They like this deal. Sixty percent or more like this deal 
the way it is
.
"
166,"
MR. McKINNON:

David
, ""No 
Labels
, no ties."" If you put that on a bumper sticker, you're going to...
"
167,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
Wait, I want to talk about 
No Labels
 in 
a little bit more
 detail in, in just a moment. Mayor, you're on the 
front lines
 of this. What's going on in 
Newark
, 
New Jersey
, in your 
state
? What's the real economic 
impact
 of this tax deal, do you think?
"
168,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, you know, the first rule of holes is to stop digging. And this is a bill, in many ways, that continues the digging, and we have to be worried if that's going to run up the 
deficit
 in the long term. But it is, in the short term, undeniably going to benefit our 
economy
. It's going to create jobs, it's going to 
sustain
 people who are hurting right now. We have a herd of hurt going on in our 
nation
 right now. But the reality is -- I don't like the, the false debates that we create in 
America
 that often make for great spectator sports, but that's not what 
democracy
's about. It's about doing something that's really going to advance our 
country
. And what bothers me is an attack on wealth. I'm not in favor of sort of just 
tax cuts
 for the wealthy that they're just going to hold on to. But creating the right incentives in our 
nation
, especially right now, that incentivize 
investment
 in business, research, education. These are the kind of things that I think are good to spend on right now because they're going to build a longer -- a stronger 
economy
 in the long term.
"
169,"
MAYOR BOOKER:
Also -- but, 
Andrea
, in terms of 
2012
, you have 
Republicans
 lining themselves up -- 
Mitt Romney
, 
Mike Pence
, others -- who voted against this thing.
"
170,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right. You know, I think the smartest thing that, that the 
White House
 did in the last couple of days, and the, the dumbest thing that the 
Republicans
 did was the 
Dream Act
. To go against giving a fast track towards citizenship to infants who came here, and with the growing 
Latino
 community in 
2012
, that is going to turn out to be a real setback for 
Republicans
 because these are, are people who wanted to serve in the 
military
 and get educated and contribute to this society. It is a win-win from the standpoint of 
The Wall Street Journal
 and 
The New York Times.
 So this is...
"
171,"
MS. MITCHELL:
But forget the politics. The pragmatism of it, we are a 
nation
 that's built our 
country
 on immigrants.
"
172,"
MAYOR BOOKER:
Exactly.
"
173,"
MS. MITCHELL:
From 
Einstein
 to some of our greatest scientists have been people coming in. And to tell people who've been through 
high school
, been 
high school
 presidents, gone to the college, some of the 
best brains
, who have no relation to the 
home country
.
"
174,"
MAYOR BOOKER:
And served on the 
front lines
.
"
175,"
MS. MITCHELL:
Exactly. This is crazy. It's hurting 
America
.
"
176,"
MAYOR BOOKER:
But I want to get a quick comment from 
Mark
 on this...
"
177,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah.
"
178,"
MR. McKINNON:
...because I have talked to 
Republicans
 as well. And by the way, this is -- there's some set back here for the president's attempts to get 
immigration reform
. The 
Republicans
 I've talked to, as well, say look, I wish my party would stand up and get 
immigration reform
 done. 
President Bush
 did it, perhaps, at the wrong time, suffered for it, couldn't get it done in his term, but the 
impact
 of the 
Republican Party
 has been great.
"
179,"
MR. GREGORY:
Absolutely. It's the right thing to do, but on the pure politics of it, the 
Republican Party
 has got to recognize that 
Hispanics
 are the huge growing demographic in this 
country
. When 
President Bush
 ran in 
2000
, we got 40 percent of the 
Hispanic
 vote. We knew we had to grow that in 
2004
. We got 44 percent. 
John McCain
 got 29 percent of the 
Hispanic
 vote. We've got to send the right signal to 
Hispanics
 in this 
country
 in addition to the fact that it's the right policy.
"
180,"
MR. McKINNON:
Let me get a break in here. I want to come back after a break, talk about some of the larger challenges that the 
country
 faces and how our politics will respond. More from our 
roundtable
 right after this.
"
181,"
MR. GREGORY:
We're back, joined by our 
political
roundtable
, and look at this finding from our latest 
NBC News
/
Wall Street Journal
 poll about how people feel about where the 
country
's headed. Look at that, 63 percent think the 
country
's off on the wrong track. 
Mark McKinnon
, you know as a 
political
 pro, that that is a really good indication of the independent vote and where that independent vote might actually go. This was a scene this week, the 
No Labels
 launch, the idea of an independent 
political movement
 that could somehow break ties. And you had some pretty big figures on the right and the left, but you've also been accused of ""childish 
magical thinking
."" That was 
Frank Rich
 in 
The New York Times
 today. The idea that the heavy lifting of moving the 
country
 forward could be accomplished by a no 
labels
 group is on many, on the left and the right, just unthinkable.
"
182,"

"
183,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, the 
political
 -- 63 percent of 
Americans
 are disenfranchised with what's happening in 
Washington
 because they see this harsh, poisonous environment and harsh partisanship. A thousand people from -- representing all 
50 states
 came to 
New York
 to help launch this effort called 
No Labels
, which is designed to bring more civility to politics and address the hyperpartisanship. And we've had a great success already because we brought together the harsh partisans on the left and the harsh partisans on the right, 
Rush Limbaugh
, 
Frank Rich
, they're all attacking us because they don't want -- they think it's 
magical thinking
 when 
Cory Booker
 works with Governor 
Christie
, working together for solutions. They don't want that because it doesn't help their ratings, it doesn't help their profits. And 
Frank Rich
 attacked us in 
The New York Times
 today saying we only had three black speakers. Well, he obviously didn't watch the event or he's doing sloppy research because we had three prominent featured 
African-American
 speakers, including Mayor Booker, who spoke about all the things that he's doing as mayor there. So it's been a tremendous response we're getting from the 
middle
 of 
America
 who think that we need to work together like the, like the vice president said.
"
184,"
MR. McKINNON:
Well, 
Joe
, what about devil's advocate time here, which is why don't we recognize that politics is not a dirty game...
"
185,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
186,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
...that people have deeply held ideological views and differences.
"
187,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
188,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
...and that -- look what's happened in the 
Republican Party
. It has become more conservative because a lot of 
Republicans
 thought, and even independents, that it got away from basic principles.
"
189,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, sure. But, but as we've been saying for two years on our show, this is still 
James Madison
's 
Constitution
. You have 
Frank Rich
 on the left enraged by what 
Mark
's doing; 
Rush Limbaugh
 on the right, enraged. And they have the luxury of never actually governing. Never being a president, never being a senator, never being in 
Congress
, realizing you actually have to, 
at the end of the day
, sit down and deal with people across the aisle. You want to talk about magical, childish thinking? To quote 
Joan Didion
, 
Frank Rich
 and the left have had a year of 
magical thinking
 right now, where they believed they can get absolutely everything they wanted, and when they didn't get it, they became petulant and went off in the corner. What did that end up getting them? Well, about 80, 85 newly elected 
Republicans
 in the 
House of Representatives
. We govern in the 
middle
. We always have. With, with apologies to 
Arthur Schlessinger
, there's not a pendulum swing ideologically in 
America
. 
America
 stays in the 
middle
, and we saw it.
"
190,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
And...
"
191,"
MR. GREGORY:
When, when you go too 
far left
, they slap you back and when 
Republicans
 go too far right, they slap you back as well, into the center.
"
192,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
But here's -- Mayor Booker, here's the question I have for how 
President Obama
 tries to channel that vibe in the 
country
. What does he do to actually make the politics difficult for 
Republicans
 now? Because it hadn't been that difficult up till now.
"
193,"
MR. GREGORY:
But, but this is what's ridiculous and this is what I think 
President Obama
, his experience on streets in 
Chicago
 really helped out. You've got 
real people
 -- my city, you've got 
real people
 who don't care about politics or process, they're looking for 
progress
. And when it comes to issues like this tax bill, the president made a 
compromise
 to help 
Americans
 who are desperately in need. And this is what frustrates me, seeing what's going on in 
Newark
 every single day, I cannot advance our city with a Republican governor unless we find common ground. Some of the best advancements we've had, working with the 
Manhattan Institute
 on issues around ex-offender re-entry, there's enough common ground in the 
United States of America
 for us to stop this silly pulling 
left and right
, which is good for the ratings, but has nothing to do with us moving our 
country
 forward.
"
194,"
MAYOR BOOKER:

Andrea
, I know you want -- I'm sure you have a comment on this, but I want to get you on 
Afghanistan
.
"
195,"
MR. GREGORY:
Sure.
"
196,"
MS. MITCHELL:
Because hearing the vice president, who made news this morning saying, ""
2014
, 
come hell or high water
""...
"
197,"
MR. GREGORY:
""We're out of there.""
"
198,"
MS. MITCHELL:
...""
the United States
 is out of there. That's a 
significant
 piece of news.
"
199,"
MR. GREGORY:
It's a 
significant
 piece of news and he has always been one of the skeptics...
"
200,"
MS. MITCHELL:
Yeah.
"
201,"
MR. GREGORY:
...about the Afghan policy and the surge policy. I think that they realize they have to give people an endgame, an end in sight. This 
country
 cannot afford it, not politically, not fiscally, to continue with 
no end in sight
. And with the evidence, which was really diminished in their report this week, this past week, they did not focus on what everyone knows from other reports -- the corruption of that 
government
, the 
Karzai
government
, the fact that we don't have a partner there. Now, tragically, we don't have 
Richard Holbrooke
 trying to hold people to the fire, what 
General Petraeus
 in 
The Washington Post
 today calls his ""diplomatic wingman""...
"
202,"
MS. MITCHELL:
Mm-hmm.
"
203,"
MR. GREGORY:
...in a very telling...
"
204,"
MS. MITCHELL:
This goes back to the irresponsibility again...
"
205,"
MAYOR BOOKER:
Yeah.
"
206,"
MR. GREGORY:
...where it's the first time in the history of our 
country
 where we went to war and we gave 
tax breaks
 at the same time. The cost of this war, the upfront cost, over a trillion 
dollars
 right now.
"
207,"
MAYOR BOOKER:
And...
"
208,"
MS. MITCHELL:
And we're still doing it. Hold on a second though. 
Barack Obama
 tripled the 
number of troops
 in 
Afghanistan
, and he just doubled down without really giving a big fight on 
tax cuts
 for millionaires.
"
209,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
That's why what the -- that's why what the vice president said was so 
significant
.
"
210,"
MS. MITCHELL:
But, but, but no, it's not 
significant
 because, with all due respect to the vice president of the 
United States
, we just told our 
NATO
 allies a few weeks ago to ignore that 
2014
 deadline because we're going to be there past 
2014
. They went to the 
NATO
 conference and they said, ""OK, we know about 
2014
, but it's actually going to be extended beyond."" So, if you're keeping score at home on 
Afghanistan
, the generals are winning with talk...
"
211,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
I think...
"
212,"
MS. MITCHELL:
Well, and -- but you have an issue, you have an issue, 
Andrea
...
"
213,"
MR. GREGORY:
...of 
2011
 to 
2014
, now beyond.
"
214,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
...in 
Pakistan
 where, if, if insurgents and 
al-Qaeda
 can still hide in the sanctuaries in 
Pakistan
, what are we going to turn, 
turn over
 to?
"
215,"
MR. GREGORY:
Look, you've had 
U.S.
 officials this very week saying that it was the 
Pakistan
intelligence service
 that outed our 
CIA
station chief
 there. Whether or not they have evidence of that, that shows the attitude, the lack of cooperation. As long as 
Pakistan
 is such a pit, really, of instability, and a nuclear-armed 
country
, you're not going to have the outcome in 
Afghanistan
 you want.
"
216,"
MS. MITCHELL:
Our two partners...
"
217,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
But what they are really doing now is forecasting a, a way out. Whether 
Barack Obama
 is there to see this way out in 
2014
, I think they think it is critical. Just last night, I was with an officer who is just back and has been told they have to return. 
And I
 stood and watched the look in his -- it was a male officer...
"
218,"
MS. MITCHELL:
Mm-hmm.
"
219,"
MR. GREGORY:
...looked at his wife and saw the tears welling up in her eyes as they're acknowledging what's happening in their life. He has just returned from a tour. We cannot 
sustain
 these multiple tours.
"
220,"
MS. MITCHELL:
By the way, this has been going on for a decade.
"
221,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
That's exactly why there has...
"
222,"
MS. MITCHELL:
The generals want us to stay there for another decade, and I guarantee you we're not out of there in 
2014
 if they continue, if they continue to take the course they're taking.
"
223,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
Right.
"
224,"
MR. GREGORY:
I think public sentiment turns to...
"
225,"
MAYOR BOOKER:
And our allies are 
Karzai
 and 
Pakistan
. That is a nightmare.
"
226,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
But, Mayor, you say public sentiment -- I mean, the public is already saying it's not worth it.
"
227,"
MR. GREGORY:
I think -- and you also have a president now that is saying...
"
228,"
MAYOR BOOKER:
Yeah, right.
"
229,"
MR. GREGORY:
...is giving firm deadlines and a clarification of what our role -- we're not 
nation
-building. We're trying to disrupt and dismantle terrorism. That's a singular mission, and we're going to get that done as soon as possible.
"
230,"
MAYOR BOOKER:
All right. Let me, let me get a, let me get a break in here.
"
231,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:

"
232,"
MR. GREGORY:
But we are 
nation building
.
"
233,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
Let me get a break in here, a quick break. We'll come back with final thoughts from our 
roundtable
 right after this.
"
234,"
MR. GREGORY:
Just a minute here to button up our conversation. Well, if you've seen 
Time magazine
, 
Person of the Year
, 
Mark Zuckerberg
 from 
Facebook
. And Mayor Booker, you spent a 
little time
 with Mr. 
Zuckerberg
 this year. It's not just 
Facebook
, but what he's trying to do for education in your town is 
significant
.
"
235,"

"
236,"
MR. GREGORY:
It's inspiring. Look, the greatest threat to our 
national security
 in a noble- -in a global knowledge-based 
economy
 is education. You cannot have a first class 
democracy
 and not even be in the 
top 10
 in the globe in reading, science and math.
"
237,"
MAYOR BOOKER:

Mm.

"
238,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
In fact, the math not even in the top 15. So it's great to see 
Mark Zuckerberg
, who I think is a genius in creating wealth, creating connections, really manifesting in a, in a virtual way, this interwoven destinies that we have. But him doubling down on education like 
Broad
, like 
Gates
, like 
Walton
 and so many others, is...
"
239,"
MAYOR BOOKER:
And it is, like I say, it's the new form of 
American patriotism
. We're going to really see a big push on this next year, that the competitiveness of 
America
 is tied to how well our kids are doing in schools.
"
240,"
MR. GREGORY:
It's not tied, it's actually, it's more than tied. It's essential. If we do not have a great 
education system
, we will fail as a 
democracy
.
"
241,"
MAYOR BOOKER:
And the 
Asian countries
 are completely outdistancing us.
"
242,"
MS. MITCHELL:
Right.
"
243,"
MR. GREGORY:
That should -- that should be our new moon shot.
"
244,"
MR. McKINNON:
That's why 
cities
 like 
Newark
...
"
245,"
MAYOR BOOKER:
It really should be.
"
246,"
MR. McKINNON:
Yeah.
"
247,"
MR. GREGORY:
...and 
Oakland
 and 
San Antonio
, that's where the destiny of 
America
's going to be formed.
"
248,"
MAYOR BOOKER:
We got to...
"
249,"
MR. McKINNON:
And for the new year let's hope 
President Obama
, 
Michael Bloomberg
, 
Cory Booker
, conservatives altogether, 
education reform
.
"
250,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
Yeah. This is why we're all coming together.
"
251,"
MAYOR BOOKER:
You guys could do some great things this year.
"
252,"
MR. SCARBOROUGH:
Want to -- that's a good note to leave on. Before we go this morning, 
Andrea
 mentioned that we remember 
Richard Holbrooke
, 
President Obama
's 
special representative
 for 
Afghanistan
 and 
Pakistan
, died Monday at the age of 69. An iconic American diplomat, 
Holbrooke
 worked for every Democratic president since 
John F. Kennedy
, was perhaps best known for negotiating an end, of course, to the 
Bosnian War
 in 
1995
. He appeared on this program five times over his long career. His first appearance back in 
1976
 was not as a newsmaker -- look at that -- but as managing editor of 
Foreign Policy magazine
 when he was part of a panel of journalists questioning Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin
. His family and loved ones are in our thoughts and prayers this morning. That is all for today. We will -- we'll be back next week, the day after 
Christmas
, a special discussion on the incredible 
political
 year of 
2010
, and what to look for in 
2011
 and 
2012

MR. GREGORY:

262,"Announcer: From NBC News in Washington , MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory . "
263,"MR. GREGORY: Good morning. A busy Saturday in the Senate as eight Republicans joined with Democrats to end the ban on gays and lesbians in the military . Democratic sponsors of the Dream Act immigration bill, however, fell several votes short of the 60 needed to overcome Republican opposition. Still unsettled, the fate of the new START treaty , the nuclear arms treaty with Russia , which will continue to be debated today in a rare Sunday session. Late Friday I sat down with the man who has become the president's point man in dealing with Congress , the vice president of the United States , Joe Biden . Mr. Vice President, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS . "
264,VICE PRES. JOE BIDEN: Good to be back. 
265,"MR. GREGORY: Good to have you here. And it's an important time. The end of the week saw you and the president closing a very important deal, this compromise over an extension of the Bush -era tax cuts , a bill signing at the White House , striking in that you had a Republican there... "
266,VICE PRES. BIDEN: Yeah. 
267,"MR. GREGORY: ... Mitch McConnell , for the first time . So a new era, perhaps, in Washington . The bottom line is the focus on getting people back to work. What does this deal mean to the end of that goal? "
268,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: This means two things. Number one, every econometric model, every basic economist out there says, Look, this is going to grow the economy faster next year than it would have. The projections are instead of the economy growing at a -- the GDP growing at a roughly 2.5 percent, some suggest it would grow as high as 4 percent. That means employment. That means more people employed, number one. Number two, this wasn't just extending the Bush -era tax cuts . It extended all the tax cuts for the middle class and all the tax cuts for the poor that were in our legislation, the Obama legislation. We came up with a tax cut of two percent for everybody who gets a payroll check, and on their -- not the employer, the employee gets a two percent. For example, someone making $60 grand a year is going to get another $1,200 on top of the middle -class tax cut . We continued all those tax cuts for the working poor , the so-called EITC , earned income tax credits , and maybe most importantly, were able to extend for another 13 months unemployment insurance for those devastated by this recession. "
269,"MR. GREGORY: What about the prospect of eliminating uncertainty? In what may be the first salvo of the 2012 campaign, Mitt Romney said, ""Look, this really doesn't solve the problem. This is not good for the economy because businesses understand that in a couple of years these rates are going back up."" "
270,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: No. Look , here's the -- businesses don't care about the top-end tax cut except those people making a million bucks. They're the ones that care. What the businesses care about are the extension of all of those tax cuts for business that we extended, the so-called extenders. For example, we provided for 100 percent expensing. The guy run -- runs a contracting company, he goes buy a $50,000 backhoe, he can expense it in one year now. That's going to encourage him to go out, invest, buy, build. And so all of those we hope we're going to be able to continue. The one target for us in two years is no longer extending the upper income tax credit for millionaires and billionaires, and scaling back what we had to do to get the compromise , the estate tax for the very wealthy. "
271,MR. GREGORY: But the president has said he thinks he can win this argument on the merits in... 
272,VICE PRES. BIDEN: I think he can. 
273,"MR. GREGORY: Well, then why not do it now? Why wait until 2012 , an election year? Do you really expect, in an election year, that anybody's not going to vote to extend the tax cuts ? "
274,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: Yeah, I do. I do. "
275,MR. GREGORY: What'll be different? 
276,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: Well, I think what'll be different is that we will have had the outcome of the deficit commission , we will be able to make the case much more clearly that spending $700 billion over 10 years to extend tax cuts for people whose income averages well over a million dollars does not make sense, number one. Number two, we're not going to be -- we're not in a position, David , where we're going to have, God willing , the shaky economy where we could not afford to continue uncertainty for a month or two or three in the next year had we not made a deal which would actually grow the economy . The, the obverse was equally as true. Had we kicked this into next year, it would have created such uncertainty, and there are a number of economists who thought that it would -- may, in fact, induce a double-dip recession. So we not only avoided it getting worse, we made it -- the prospects much better for the economy . "
277,"MR. GREGORY: The, the irony of achieving this tax deal is that it does represent a broken promise by this president in how he campaigned, and how you campaigned as well. In September you were interviewed by my colleague Rachel Maddow , and you had an exchange about this fight over extending the tax cut for wealthier Americans . Let me play a portion of that. "
278,"MS. RACHEL MADDOW: Does that mean that letting the Bush tax cuts expire for the richest people in the country while pushing for their extension, a middle -class tax cut for everybody else , is that a black and white issue? Is that a -- we haven't heard a veto threat, for example, from the president on that. "
279,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: No, it, it is a black and white ... "
280,MS. MADDOW: Is -- it's a black and white issue. That's something that the administration's going to go to the mat for. 
281,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: It's a black and white issue. Yes, absolutely. "
282,MR. GREGORY: That was September. 
283,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: By the way, we did... "
284,"MR. GREGORY: By January, you didn't go to the mat. "
285,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: By the -- we did go to the mat. We did go to the mat. We went through every -- I went into a total of 130 races out there campaigning for Democrats . Every single race I made this case. Here's what happened. We got to the end, we couldn't get it done, and we had "
286,"to make a decision: Were we going to let the middle -class tax cuts expire? Let me remind everybody, the House passed middle -class tax cut only. It got to the United States Senate , we supported that provision, and the Senate could not pass it. So now we're left with, do we let those folks who are going to bed tonight staring at a ceiling wondering whether they're going to be in that same bed next month, or those two million people who already lost their unemployment insurance this month, seven million more losing it next month, and economic uncertainty occur? Life is a matter of really tough choices. "
287,"MR. GREGORY: The president wrote in "" Audacity of Hope "" that he found the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy morally troubling. "
288,VICE PRES. BIDEN: They are. 
289,MR. GREGORY: Is that still his belief? 
290,VICE PRES. BIDEN: It's still his belief. 
291,MR. GREGORY: Your belief as well? 
292,VICE PRES. BIDEN: Mine as well. 
293,MR. GREGORY: But you're willing to compromise on that? 
294,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: Look, it's -- the idea -- to compromise to save people who are drowning -- there's people out there drowning. There are two million people this month that can't afford to go get a Christmas tree , let alone buy any gifts, because their unemployment has run out, which means they've been unemployed for well over a year to two years. It is unfortunate we were put in the position where the Republicans made it clear they were ready to let everything fall unless they got these tax cuts . They're for two years. They're for two years, and we're coming back and going at it again. "
295,"MR. GREGORY: Can you be thought of as being serious about cutting the deficit when 80 -- within 80 hours of, of announcing the deficit commission 's proposals this administration agrees to add a trillion dollars to the deficit ? "
296,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: Absolutely, positively. Look what the deficit commission suggested. They suggested we do exactly what we did. They suggested we have a payroll tax . They suggested that we stimulate the economy this year into next year. They suggested that this has no impact on long-term debt because it's for two years. Look, you know this, the only people who are going to agree with me when I say this are the economists listening, left, right and center. In the middle of a recession, where we're just climbing out of it, where the economy -- unemployment is still at 9.7 percent, the idea of raising taxes and reducing spending is a prescription for disaster. No one is suggesting that. "
297,"MR. GREGORY: Is the balance -- to that point, do we think the balance is out of whack? There's so much attention on austerity... "
298,VICE PRES. BIDEN: Yeah. 
299,"MR. GREGORY: ...on cutting the deficit . And yet, Larry Summers , the president's outgoing top economic adviser... "
300,VICE PRES. BIDEN: Yeah. 
301,"MR. GREGORY: ...saying, look, at this particular moment in time, the priority next year should be more spending. You're the shovel-ready projects guy. There should be more investment in infrastructure. Should there, should there be more of that before we really focus on bringing down the deficit ? "
302,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: We can do both. Let me explain what I mean. In the budget we submitted and the omnibus or the, or the, the, the -- I'm sorry to sound like a senator here, or a wonk. But in the spending proposal for next year, we freeze discretionary spending . Freeze it. Freeze it. We think we have to start by all those things that have tails on them, the long-term impact , we should not be spending in those areas and we should be freezing or reducing. On those issues that have no long-term deficit -- look, the entire recovery bill -- I know you know this, but the entire recovery act of the last 18 months, over roughly $800 billion, you know how much it added to the long-term debt? Two-tenths of one percent to GDP . Two-tenths of one percent. The places where we have to go are those things that have tails, that are long-term commitments to the government . That's where the problem is, and that's what we have to attack. "
303,"MR. GREGORY: You brought up spending and I want to talk about this earmark issue, not to sound wonkish, these are the pet projects that lawmakers... "
304,VICE PRES. BIDEN: No. Yeah. 
305,"MR. GREGORY: ...put into the budget ; and you had a lot of back and forth here, and ultimately Democrats had a defeat. They pulled back their big spending bill, eliminated the earmarks . And yet, Harry Reid , the leader of the Democrats , took on the White House , wasn't "
306,"happy with all of this and said this, this week: I am convinced that I do not want to give up more power to the White House , whether it's George Bush or Barack Obama. And I 'm going to fight as hard as I can against President Obama on these earmarks and my Republican colleagues who hate to vote for them, but love to get them. "
307,"SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV): Bottom line is, if there is some temporary measure to keep the government funded, will the president down the road veto a bill that includes earmarks or not? "
308,"MR. GREGORY: David , if the question is, in order to keep the patient alive, we have to use medicine we don't like, we may have to do it. I'm not going to second -- if... "
309,VICE PRES. BIDEN: But the president said he regretted when he's done that in the past. 
310,MR. GREGORY: Well... 
311,VICE PRES. BIDEN: He regretted signing a bill with earmarks ... 
312,MR. GREGORY: Well... 
313,VICE PRES. BIDEN: ...and that after the election it was a new day. 
314,"MR. GREGORY: Well, look, in this budget that was -- is being debated for -- to keep the government running for the next month and year, there is a freeze in discretionary spending . Also, there is an increase in spending for our troops that are in the middle of a war. Those two things we think are essential. Now, if you say to me, do we have to accept a project in -- and by the way, there were six Republican appropriators who supported this who had earmarks in it. If we say we have to support a, a levy in Mississippi in order to make sure my kid, who's out in the middle of Iraq or Afghanistan gets what he needs, I'm going to say yeah. I don't want to do it, but I may have to do it. It depends on the proportions. It depends on what to say. Harry just reinforced the point we've been making. We don't like earmarks . You have the Democratic leader criticizing the president of the United States because we say we don't want earmarks . "
315,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: So, so you may not like it, but there's no veto threat. "
316,"MR. GREGORY: No, there -- it depends on the proportion. It could be very well that you wind up in a situation where you say, ""OK, in order to be able to have the funding for the continuation, the support for the troops in Afghanistan , we have to accept an earmark, and that's what the Congress sends us."" Are we going to veto a bill that will jeopardize troop safety? Probably not. Conversely, if there's a bunch of earmarks in a bill that we think is funding for several agencies that we're willing to fight over and can take a chance on losing on, yeah, we'll veto. "
317,VICE PRES. BIDEN: I want to button up a couple of other very important agenda items in this lame-duck session . 
318,MR. GREGORY: Sure. 
319,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: As we sit here today, it looks like a repeal of the ban on gays and lesbians serving in the military will be successful. It will be repealed. "
320,MR. GREGORY: We hope so. 
321,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: That, that is, as we sit here today, how it looks. What will be the impact of that happening? "
322,"MR. GREGORY: The impact , David , is we'll be in line with seven other of our allies around the world. We will not be squandering the abilities of combat soldiers as well as interpreters who happen to have a different sexual preference, who happen to be gay or happen to be lesbian. Look, all of our major allies have, for some time now, provided for all -- the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , the secretary of the Defense , the vast majority of the American people say you're -- whether you are gay or straight, it does not affect whether you can shoot straight or whether you can speak Urdu . "
323,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: What about the START treaty , the nuclear arms treaty with Russia ? Do you have the votes as we sit here to get that ratified? "
324,MR. GREGORY: I believe we do. I believe we do. 
325,VICE PRES. BIDEN: So what's holding this up? Is this political gamesmanship by Republicans or are there substantive criticisms? 
326,"MR. GREGORY: Both. With some, with John McCain , there are substantive criticisms. He was worried about whether or not we're going to make good on our commitment to deploy all four phases of the missile defense system in Europe. We are. That's a legitimate concern. There's other legitimate concerns. There have been 18 hearings, 1,000 questions we've answered and -- but another is they just simply are against any arms control agreement. That's the category that, when I say any, they're simply against this arms control . Senator DeMint is absolutely four square against it. It wouldn't matter what it said. And conversely, and there are people like Senator McCain and leading Republicans like Johnny Isakson in Georgia who think this is a good, substantive thing for U.S. security. I might add, every former Republican secretary of Defense , secretary of State , national security adviser, and head of strategic command says this is essential for U.S. security. "
327,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: Let me move on to foreign affairs . I want to talk about the fallout from the WikiLeaks scandal. Julian Assange appeared on the ""Today"" show on Friday morning and he said there are more leaks to come. This is what he told Matt Lauer in part: "
328,"MR. GREGORY: As we have seen, WikiLeaks is a robust organization. During my time in solitary confinement in the basement of a Victorian prison, we continue to release, our media partners continued to write stories. The important revelations from this material continue to come out. We have approximately 2,000 cables into 250,000. "
329,MR. JULIAN ASSANGE: More to come. Should the United States do something to stop Mr. Assange ? 
330,"MR. GREGORY: We're looking into that right now. The Justice Department is taking a look at that, and I'm not going to comment on, on that process. "
331,VICE PRES. BIDEN: Do you think he's a criminal? 
332,"MR. GREGORY: If he conspired to get these classified documents with a member of the U.S. military , that's fundamentally different than if somebody drops on your lap, ""Here, David , you're a press person, here is classified material."" "
333,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: Mitch McConnell says he's a high tech terrorist, others say this is akin to the Pentagon Papers . Where do you come down? "
334,"MR. GREGORY: I would argue that it's closer to being a high tech terrorist than, than the Pentagon Papers . But look, this guy has, has done things that have damaged and, and put into jeopardy the lives and, and occupations of people in other parts of the world. He's made it more difficult for us to conduct our, our business with our allies and our friends. For example, in my meetings, you know I meet with most of these world leaders , there is a desire now to meet with me alone rather than have staff in the room. It makes things more cumbersome. And so it is, it has done damage. "
335,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: Let me ask you about Afghanistan . The president's review released this week, you've been described in The New York Times as "" Obama 's in- house pessimist on Afghanistan ."" Are we winning or losing in Afghanistan ? "
336,"MR. GREGORY: Let me separate this out, remind everybody what our goal is. Our overarching goal and our rationale for being there is to defeat and -- to dismantle, ultimately defeat al-Qaeda , residing -- central al-Qaeda residing in the Fatah , the western regions of the mountains of, of Pakistan . Secondly, to make sure that terrorists do not, in fact, bring down the Pakistani government , which is a nuclear power . Toward that end, we think it's important that there be stability in Afghanistan so that al-Qaeda cannot re-establish it as a base from which to attack the United States of America. With regard to our efforts to degrade al-Qaeda , we're making great progress . The so-called C.T. , that is counterterrorism, the use of special forces and the like to go after individuals who make up the leadership of al-Qaeda and of the Taliban . On the issue of counterinsurgency, that is where we clear, hold and build and transfer, we're making progress not as rapidly as we are on the other front . President's been frank to say that in his release, pointing out that we need two things that we're working on very hard and we're making "
337,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: one, Pakistan and safe havens; and two, governance in Afghanistan . "
338,some progress: All of this is so complicated. 
339,MR. GREGORY: It is. 
340,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: After 10 years, Mr. Vice President, can't you just say straight whether we're winning of losing? "
341,MR. GREGORY: Well... 
342,VICE PRES. BIDEN: Don't the American people deserve to know something about where we stand? 
343,"MR. GREGORY: Well, no -- they -- I, I -- the one thing I've never been accused of is not being straight. They are -- we are making progress . "
344,VICE PRES. BIDEN: Yeah... 
345,"MR. GREGORY: Are we making sufficient progress fast enough? The answer remains to be seen. Here's what we said. We said we were going to -- we -- after seven years of neglect of an Afghan policy when we came to office, we had to sit down. I went off to Afghanistan at the president's request, came back with a recommendation, and said we have to clarify our objectives and then decide what forces we need in order to sustain the possibility of making sure we accomplish those objectives. We've done that. We said we'd sit down in December and make -- and look at it and review the progress we're making. We were honest with the American people , we're making progress in all fronts, more in some areas than in others. We are going to, come July, begin to draw down American forces and transfer responsibility to the... "
346,VICE PRES. BIDEN: Will that be a token amount of soldiers? Will it be a couple of thousand troops and no more? 
347,"MR. GREGORY: No. Well, well -- it, it will not be a token amount, but the degree to which we draw down -- if I can make an analogy to Iran -- I mean, excuse me, to, to Iraq , which I've been put in charge of. "
348,VICE PRES. BIDEN: Yeah. 
349,"MR. GREGORY: What happened there? We signed, three years ago, an agreement with the Iraqis saying that what we're going to do is, two summers ago we're going to draw all combat troops out of the cities , populated areas. Then we said, our administration, we're going to draw 100,000 troops out the next summer. And we're going to be totally out. In the meantime, we're going to help build a government , we're going to transfer responsibility, and we're going to be gone. That's exactly what we did at the recent Lisbon conference, the NATO conference, where we said, ""We're starting this process, just like we did in Iraq . We're starting it in July of 2011 , and we're going to be totally out of there come hell or high water by 2014 ."" "

"
351,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: Let me ask you about something that's on a lot of Americans ' minds. As we talk about Afghanistan , number one goal is preventing another terror state in Afghanistan from, from where terrorist attacks can be launched. We know what happened with the Christmas Day bomber during the holidays last year. What is the capacity of al-Qaeda or affiliated organizations to pull off a large scale terror attack against this country ? "
352,"MR. GREGORY: Well, you never say never, OK? But we are, our intelligence community , is united in the view that the ability of central al-Qaeda , that is Osama bin Laden and company in the Af-Pak area, in those mountains, has been significantly degraded, and we don't believe they have the capacity from there to pull of a, a 9/11 type operation. But what has also happened, as you've noticed, you've seen in the Arabian peninsula , you've seen in other parts of the world where there are al-Qaeda , al-Qaeda -related affiliates not under the direct control of, of Osama , but yet engaged with him. They are planning much smaller-bore but yet deadly attempts to go after the United States of America. We saw that in the underpants bomber last Christmas , we saw that in the Times Square effort. So there are going to be continued efforts to be able to, coming, quite frankly, more likely out of places other than the Fatah -- excuse me, other than Pakistan , where bin Laden is. But we have significantly degraded and knocked off a lot of the main planners and organizers and trainers. Does that mean we've succeeded? No. Does that mean we're in much better shape than we were a year ago and two and three? Yes. "
353,VICE PRES. BIDEN: I want to ask -- let's spend a couple minutes talking about leadership and politics here as we look ahead to 2011 . You know this town pretty well. You know politics in this town very well. President Obama has just come through a real tough election . What is the key to turning things around for him? 
354,"MR. GREGORY: The key to turning things around is that having everyone understand the message of that election . We understand it. The message is the American public wants us to cooperate, wants us to work together. That's why, if we get the START agreement, we will have this lame-duck session , since the election , heard the message and the Republicans will have heard the message that they want us to reasonably compromise to move the business of the nation forward as we just did on the economy with regard to taxes and growth, and as, God willing , we're going to do on national security with regard to START . And I think that is the message of the election . "
355,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: But don't you -- can't you understand, though, a lot of voters look up at this president and say, you know, ""We're not sure we get him. Is he, is he a liberal, is, is he a moderate, is he a pragmatist? What is he, exactly?"" "
356,"MR. GREGORY: What he is, is he is a progressive leader who, in fact, understands that politics is all about the art of the, the possible, and it's critically important to do two things. He "
357,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: Promote economic growth and keep America safe. And so, to the extent that he has to make compromises that don't compromise those two objectives, he will. "
358,"knows his job as two overarching responsibilities: This is not a guy who campaigned saying, ""Look, politics is the art of the possible."" This is someone who campaigned, both of you did, coming to Washington saying, ""Business is going to change around here."" "
359,MR. GREGORY: Well... 
360,VICE PRES. BIDEN: And that's why so many new voters came into the process. They expected more. 
361,"MR. GREGORY: By, by the way, that's exactly what the president did say, that business was going to change. You remember, I ran against him in, in the primaries. I've always been a little less optimistic about the idea that somehow the Republicans last year were going to join hands with us. The president reached out. He reached out in every way to the Republicans last year to say, ""Hey, let's work on health care . Let's work on this. let's work..."" They made a very calculated decision. You know it and I know it. I'm not -- most people know it. I know it, that they decided that it was in their best interest to not see much move forward cooperatively and it would hurt the Democrats because they were in charge. They turned out to be right. But they got a second message . They found out that, that the public didn't like the Democrats , but they sure in the devil didn't like the Republicans either. And most polls showed they liked the Republicans less. And so the message that came out, I believe, and would -- you saw what Mitch McConnell and John Boehner , both who are friends of mine, who I've worked with for years, they came out of this and say, ""Hm, we better get, get a compromise ."" Can you imagine last year, the Republicans agreeing on a compromise like the one we had here, where they took things that are religion to them, which are, ""No earned income tax credit, that's not a tax, that's a giveaway, that -- we're not going to do that."" Guess what? There's $200 billion of that stuff now. "
362,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: When you look at compromise , does Vice President Biden become negotiator-in-chief from here on in? You've got the relationships on the Hill . "
363,"MR. GREGORY: Well, by the way, you know, every -- I, I, I get asked that a lot lately since this worked. That's been my role from the beginning. For example, I've repeated -- I've met with -- I, I'm the guy that's gone up on the important issues to the House , and I'm the guy that goes -- I'm vice president of the United States . They know when I speak, I speak for the president. So last year, everybody said, "" God , you -- you know, if Rahm Emanuel were here, he would have been the one going up to the House and the House caucus."" Not true. It would have been me, whether he were here or not. Just like it was last year. On three important occasions, I was the guy that went to the House to try to sell them, and in two cases sold them, on what to do. And look, I have -- one of the things that matters in this town, and you know it as well as I do, your word matters. There's not a single Democrat or Republican who's ever worked with me that will not look you in the eye and say, "" Biden has never, ever, ever broken his word."" So that's why I'm able to go up there. I don't always succeed, but I like these guys, they're my friends. I've got -- a lot of these Republicans are my friends. "
364,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: Final question, Mr. Vice President. I know you're a Phillies fan. I've been talking about the Phillies a lot here... "
365,MR. GREGORY: Yeah. 
366,VICE PRES. BIDEN: ... and I 'm a Dodgers and a Nationals fan. 
367,"MR. GREGORY: I know, I know. "
368,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: But I've got to ask you, Cliff Lee, are they the odds-on favorite to win the championship with that rotation? "
369,MR. GREGORY: I think they are. I think they are. I honest to God think they are. 
370,VICE PRES. BIDEN: That's the prediction? 
371,"MR. GREGORY: But last time we spoke, I told you I still thought we had a chance to make it to the series this year. I was obviously wrong about that. But I really do. I mean, and how many people said, ""We'll never, ever, ever sign him""? "
372,VICE PRES. BIDEN: That's right . We'll leave it there. Mr. Vice President. Merry Christmas . 
373,"MR. GREGORY: Where there's life, there's hope. "
374,VICE PRES. BIDEN: Thank you very much . Appreciate it. 
375,"MR. GREGORY: Thank you very, very much. Appreciate it. "
376,"VICE PRES. BIDEN: And up next, analysis on the president's leadership as the 111th Congress wraps up its work, and what can we expect from both parties in the new Congress . Plus, setting the stage for the 2012 race for the White House . Our political roundtable weighs in: Host of MSNBC 's "" Morning Joe ,"" former Republican congressman from Florida , Joe Scarborough ; mayor of Newark , New Jersey , Democrat Cory Booker ; GOP strategist and co-founder of No Labels , Mark McKinnon ; plus NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell . "
377,"MR. GREGORY: Coming up, our political roundtable weighs in on how the president scored victories in the week before Christmas , and how a Republican House will change Washington , after this brief commercial break . "
378,"MR. GREGORY: We're back, joined now by our political roundtable , and much to discuss: GOP strategist, co-founder of No Labels and former adviser to President George W. Bush , Senator John McCain , Mark McKinnon , in a very handsome scarf this morning; NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell ; host of MSNBC 's "" Morning Joe ,"" Morning Joe himself, former Republican congressman -- I think we all know that by now -- from Florida ... "
379,MR. GREGORY: I'm proud to say it. With a tie. 
380,"MR. JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yeah, I think you've mentioned it once, once in a -- with a tie. Joe Scarborough. "
381,MR. GREGORY: I don't like talking about myself like Joe Biden . I try not to. 
382,"MR. SCARBOROUGH: And mayor of Newark , New Jersey , Democrat Cory Booker . Welcome to all of you. Good to have all of you. We've got news to talk about, Joe Scarborough . ""Don't_Ask,_Don't_Tell,"" this was a significant campaign promise by the president. He got it done, that's been lifted. And look at the bipartisan support that he gets here. Look at the Republicans who voted to lift the ban: Scott Brown from Massachusetts , but then you got guys like Richard Burr from North Carolina , John Ensign from Nevada . Give the president his due here, this is a big deal . "
383,"MR. GREGORY: It's a big deal for him politically, as well for a lot of Americans who supported this. This is a president who was forced to go on Jon Stewart saying, ""Yes, we can, but..."" "
384,MR. SCARBOROUGH: Mm-hmm. 
385,"MR. GREGORY: It's a president that's had to strike a deal with Republicans , a tax deal that his base loathed. Whether -- Joe Biden can spin it anyway he wants to spin it. This -- that tax bill was a big loss for the Democratic base and for the president. So this was something the president really needed going into the new year to explain to his base, ""This is one reason why you elected me."" "
386,"MR. SCARBOROUGH: And yet, Mark McKinnon , John Cornyn from Texas , senator, spoke for others like Senator McCain who said this is going to do a lot of damage. That's what Senator "
387,"MR. GREGORY: ""With three of the four military chiefs expressing clear reservations over the proposed repeal of Don't Ask , Don't Tell , today's vote shows blatant disregard for the opinions of those who know our military best. With our troops engaged in combat overseas, now is not the time to increase the level of stress on our Armed Forces through such a dramatic policy change. It's a disgrace that this latest item from the liberal legislative wish-list is being jammed through at the expense of military readiness."" "
388,"McCain said. This is what Cornyn said in a statement that he released: I strongly disagree with that, David . I think that's the same kind of thing we heard when we integrated the armed forces years ago. And I think, you know, a decade from now we're going to look back on this and just couldn't believe that it took us this long. The tide of history is rolling forward, and the president did the right thing, and so did the Republicans who crossed over . "
389,"MR. MARK McKINNON: Interesting, though, Andrea , how did they pull it off? Because we -- ""Don't_Ask,_Don't_Tell"" looked like it was dead here, and that they were going to have to suffer this defeat. It came back. "
390,"MR. GREGORY: Joe Lieberman, Susan Collins -- so bipartisan in that regard -- stripping it out of the defense appropriations bill , a clean bill that came over from the House . And you have to give a lot of credit going back to the passionate and really moral stand taken by Mike Mullen , the admiral who is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs . When he first testified to armed services and said, ""You cannot ask our uniformed men and women to tell a lie about themselves. That is against the whole conduct of the military code."" And that principled stand, a little more reluctantly but still going along with it, Robert Gates saying, ""We, we serve. We will follow the orders."" That outweighed, I think, what the combat -- the Marines and some of the... "
391,MS. ANDREA MITCHELL: Right. 
392,MR. GREGORY: ... front line forces were saying. 
393,"MS. MITCHELL: Mayor Booker, as a Democratic leader yourself, you can look at the president's leadership, see what he's accomplished here. He hopes to get the START treaty ratified as well. And then there is this tax deal, the pros and the cons. This is the president as he signed the bill, laying out what was accomplished, but also what's ahead. Take a look at this. "
394,"MR. GREGORY: Now, candidly speaking, there are some elements of this legislation that I don't like. There's some elements that members of my party don't like. There's some elements that Republicans here today don't like. That's the nature of compromise . In some ways this was easier than some of the tougher choices we're going to have to make next year. There will be times when we won't agree, and we'll have to work through those times together. "
395,PRES. OBAMA: What does this deal represent about how this president wants to approach Republicans ? 
396,"MR. GREGORY: Well, first of all just let me say, back to ""Don't_Ask,_Don't_Tell""... "
397,MAYOR CORY BOOKER (D): Yeah. 
398,"MR. GREGORY: ...this is a, a week where we saw pragmatism prevail. I think it's a moral issue, a just issue when it comes to ""Don't_Ask,_Don't_Tell."" But the reality is, the argument that won was the military preparedness . And so this is another example where pragmatism prevailed. We are in the nadir of our economic life, at least in my lifetime, as a nation . And this is a bill full of things that will immediately benefit our economy . And I look at my city, not just the expansion of unemployment benefits , which is something that all economists say will help, but more importantly, incentivizing small businesses, which are the real driver in our economy , to create jobs in cities like mine by giving them tax credits for investments they make. The earned income tax credit, giving incentives for education by giving more -- extending the tax benefits for people putting people through -- going through college. All of these things bring real benefits. And, of course, the -- our liberal base might be upset and consider it a, a treason to go against his very firm stance, going to the mat on the issue of tax breaks for the wealthy. But the reality is, in its totality, this was a victory for pragmatism, a victory for the president; but more importantly, a victory for people in, in our country . "
399,"MAYOR BOOKER: Well, I -- Joe , you, you heard the vice president say this is a president who's a progressive but who believes that politics is the art of the possible. "
400,MR. GREGORY: Right. 
401,MR. SCARBOROUGH: Is that the new President Obama ? 
402,"MR. GREGORY: ""Yes, we can, but..."" It, it's the reality. It is the reality that, that the president's had to face up to. I've got to say, though, I've got to, got to take exception with something the president said. He said, you know, we're going to face choices next year that are going to be even tougher. Well, there was nothing tough about this bill. In fact, it's frightening, it straps with -- it straps us with another trillion dollars worth of debt. Just this summer, in July, the CBO told the president and Congress , ""If you guys don't get your act together on the debt, you're going to see our credit rating go down. That's going to lead to higher interest rates, which will lead to higher debts. It'll lead to bonds collapsing. That could lead to the markets collapsing. It could lead to the United States looking a lot like Ireland and Greece ."" That was the warning. How did they respond? Adding another trillion dollars to the debt. And how did Moody's respond? By saying, ""You know, over the next two years we may have to devalue your bond rating just like Ireland 's."" It's recklessness. "
403,"MR. SCARBOROUGH: And yet, I -- it seems to me that, that austerity has to wait. I mean, that's what you saw out of this deal was that, that this president wants to do everything he can to somehow move the needle on jobs, you know, in the next -- immediate term. "
404,"MR. GREGORY: That, that's the politics of it. I think Joe is absolutely right about the long- term because basically they have so raised the level from which you're eventually going to have to cut. So to say that we're going to get serious about deficit cutting in the future... "
405,MS. MITCHELL: Mm-hmm. 
406,"MR. GREGORY: ...is, is really silly at this point. "
407,"MS. MITCHELL: This happened a week, a week... "
408,"MR. SCARBOROUGH: Right, a week. "
409,"MS. MITCHELL: ...after the debt commission figured out how to shave $3, $4 trillion, something that added another. "
410,"MR. SCARBOROUGH: But, but, but you've seen the debate. But, Mark , you see guys like Larry Summers and others saying, ""Look, we got to get the balance right . We can't move to austerity yet. We got to keep investing in the economy ."" "
411,"MR. GREGORY: Well, I think that this deal's actually going to put a lot more physics and gravity on, on now doing a real deficit reduction program and, and significant tax reform . I think there's great weight now there to bring the parties together. And by the way, I agree with the vice president. He said the American people want us to cooperate and want us to work together. That's exactly why we started No Labels , because that's what people in America are saying. They like this deal. Sixty percent or more like this deal the way it is . "
412,"MR. McKINNON: David , ""No Labels , no ties."" If you put that on a bumper sticker, you're going to... "
413,"MR. SCARBOROUGH: Wait, I want to talk about No Labels in a little bit more detail in, in just a moment. Mayor, you're on the front lines of this. What's going on in Newark , New Jersey , in your state ? What's the real economic impact of this tax deal, do you think? "
414,"MR. GREGORY: Well, you know, the first rule of holes is to stop digging. And this is a bill, in many ways, that continues the digging, and we have to be worried if that's going to run up the deficit in the long term. But it is, in the short term, undeniably going to benefit our economy . It's going to create jobs, it's going to sustain people who are hurting right now. We have a herd of hurt going on in our nation right now. But the reality is -- I don't like the, the false debates that we create in America that often make for great spectator sports, but that's not what democracy 's about. It's about doing something that's really going to advance our country . And what bothers me is an attack on wealth. I'm not in favor of sort of just tax cuts for the wealthy that they're just going to hold on to. But creating the right incentives in our nation , especially right now, that incentivize investment in business, research, education. These are the kind of things that I think are good to spend on right now because they're going to build a longer -- a stronger economy in the long term. "
415,"MAYOR BOOKER: Also -- but, Andrea , in terms of 2012 , you have Republicans lining themselves up -- Mitt Romney , Mike Pence , others -- who voted against this thing. "
416,"MR. GREGORY: Right. You know, I think the smartest thing that, that the White House did in the last couple of days, and the, the dumbest thing that the Republicans did was the Dream Act . To go against giving a fast track towards citizenship to infants who came here, and with the growing Latino community in 2012 , that is going to turn out to be a real setback for Republicans because these are, are people who wanted to serve in the military and get educated and contribute to this society. It is a win-win from the standpoint of The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. So this is... "
417,"MS. MITCHELL: But forget the politics. The pragmatism of it, we are a nation that's built our country on immigrants. "
418,MAYOR BOOKER: Exactly. 
419,"MS. MITCHELL: From Einstein to some of our greatest scientists have been people coming in. And to tell people who've been through high school , been high school presidents, gone to the college, some of the best brains , who have no relation to the home country . "
420,MAYOR BOOKER: And served on the front lines . 
421,MS. MITCHELL: Exactly. This is crazy. It's hurting America . 
422,MAYOR BOOKER: But I want to get a quick comment from Mark on this... 
423,MR. GREGORY: Yeah. 
424,"MR. McKINNON: ...because I have talked to Republicans as well. And by the way, this is -- there's some set back here for the president's attempts to get immigration reform . The Republicans I've talked to, as well, say look, I wish my party would stand up and get immigration reform done. President Bush did it, perhaps, at the wrong time, suffered for it, couldn't get it done in his term, but the impact of the Republican Party has been great. "
425,"MR. GREGORY: Absolutely. It's the right thing to do, but on the pure politics of it, the Republican Party has got to recognize that Hispanics are the huge growing demographic in this country . When President Bush ran in 2000 , we got 40 percent of the Hispanic vote. We knew we had to grow that in 2004 . We got 44 percent. John McCain got 29 percent of the Hispanic vote. We've got to send the right signal to Hispanics in this country in addition to the fact that it's the right policy. "
426,"MR. McKINNON: Let me get a break in here. I want to come back after a break, talk about some of the larger challenges that the country faces and how our politics will respond. More from our roundtable right after this. "
427,"MR. GREGORY: We're back, joined by our political roundtable , and look at this finding from our latest NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll about how people feel about where the country 's headed. Look at that, 63 percent think the country 's off on the wrong track. Mark McKinnon , you know as a political pro, that that is a really good indication of the independent vote and where that independent vote might actually go. This was a scene this week, the No Labels launch, the idea of an independent political movement that could somehow break ties. And you had some pretty big figures on the right and the left, but you've also been accused of ""childish magical thinking ."" That was Frank Rich in The New York Times today. The idea that the heavy lifting of moving the country forward could be accomplished by a no labels group is on many, on the left and the right, just unthinkable. "
428,"MR. GREGORY: Well, the political -- 63 percent of Americans are disenfranchised with what's happening in Washington because they see this harsh, poisonous environment and harsh partisanship. A thousand people from -- representing all 50 states came to New York to help launch this effort called No Labels , which is designed to bring more civility to politics and address the hyperpartisanship. And we've had a great success already because we brought together the harsh partisans on the left and the harsh partisans on the right, Rush Limbaugh , Frank Rich , they're all attacking us because they don't want -- they think it's magical thinking when Cory Booker works with Governor Christie , working together for solutions. They don't want that because it doesn't help their ratings, it doesn't help their profits. And Frank Rich attacked us in The New York Times today saying we only had three black speakers. Well, he obviously didn't watch the event or he's doing sloppy research because we had three prominent featured African-American speakers, including Mayor Booker, who spoke about all the things that he's doing as mayor there. So it's been a tremendous response we're getting from the middle of America who think that we need to work together like the, like the vice president said. "
429,"MR. McKINNON: Well, Joe , what about devil's advocate time here, which is why don't we recognize that politics is not a dirty game... "
430,MR. GREGORY: Right. 
431,MR. SCARBOROUGH: ...that people have deeply held ideological views and differences. 
432,MR. GREGORY: Right. 
433,"MR. SCARBOROUGH: ...and that -- look what's happened in the Republican Party . It has become more conservative because a lot of Republicans thought, and even independents, that it got away from basic principles. "
434,"MR. GREGORY: Well, sure. But, but as we've been saying for two years on our show, this is still James Madison 's Constitution . You have Frank Rich on the left enraged by what Mark 's doing; Rush Limbaugh on the right, enraged. And they have the luxury of never actually governing. Never being a president, never being a senator, never being in Congress , realizing you actually have to, at the end of the day , sit down and deal with people across the aisle. You want to talk about magical, childish thinking? To quote Joan Didion , Frank Rich and the left have had a year of magical thinking right now, where they believed they can get absolutely everything they wanted, and when they didn't get it, they became petulant and went off in the corner. What did that end up getting them? Well, about 80, 85 newly elected Republicans in the House of Representatives . We govern in the middle . We always have. With, with apologies to Arthur Schlessinger , there's not a pendulum swing ideologically in America . America stays in the middle , and we saw it. "
435,MR. SCARBOROUGH: And... 
436,"MR. GREGORY: When, when you go too far left , they slap you back and when Republicans go too far right, they slap you back as well, into the center. "
437,"MR. SCARBOROUGH: But here's -- Mayor Booker, here's the question I have for how President Obama tries to channel that vibe in the country . What does he do to actually make the politics difficult for Republicans now? Because it hadn't been that difficult up till now. "
438,"MR. GREGORY: But, but this is what's ridiculous and this is what I think President Obama , his experience on streets in Chicago really help out. You've got real people -- my city, you've got real people who don't care about politics or process, they're looking for progress . And when it comes to issues like this tax bill, the president made a compromise to help Americans who are desperately in need. And this is what frustrates me, seeing what's going on in Newark every single day, I cannot advance our city with a Republican governor unless we find common ground. Some of the best advancements we've had, working with the Manhattan Institute on issues around ex-offender re-entry, there's enough common ground in the United States of America for us to stop this silly pulling left and right , which is good for the ratings, but has nothing to do with us moving our country forward. "
439,"MAYOR BOOKER: Andrea , I know you want -- I'm sure you have a comment on this, but I want to get you on Afghanistan . "
440,MR. GREGORY: Sure. 
441,"MS. MITCHELL: Because hearing the vice president, who made news this morning saying, "" 2014 , come hell or high water ""... "
442,"MR. GREGORY: ""We're out of there."" "
443,"MS. MITCHELL: ..."" the United States is out of there. That's a significant piece of news. "
444,MR. GREGORY: It's a significant piece of news and he has always been one of the skeptics... 
445,MS. MITCHELL: Yeah. 
446,"MR. GREGORY: ...about the Afghan policy and the surge policy. I think that they realize they have to give people an endgame, an end in sight. This country cannot afford it, not politically, not fiscally, to continue with no end in sight . And with the evidence, which was really diminished in their report this week, this past week, they did not focus on what everyone knows from other reports -- the corruption of that government , the Karzai government , the fact that we don't have a partner there. Now, tragically, we don't have Richard Holbrooke trying to hold people to the fire, what General Petraeus in The Washington Post today calls his ""diplomatic wingman""... "
447,MS. MITCHELL: Mm-hmm. 
448,MR. GREGORY: ...in a very telling... 
449,MS. MITCHELL: This goes back to the irresponsibility again... 
450,MAYOR BOOKER: Yeah. 
451,"MR. GREGORY: ...where it's the first time in the history of our country where we went to war and we gave tax breaks at the same time. The cost of this war, the upfront cost, over a trillion dollars right now. "
452,MAYOR BOOKER: And... 
453,"MS. MITCHELL: But we're still doing it. Hold on a second though. Barack Obama tripled the number of troops in Afghanistan , and he just doubled down without really giving a big fight on tax cuts for millionaires. "
454,MR. SCARBOROUGH: That's why what the -- that's why what the vice president said was so significant . 
455,"MS. MITCHELL: But, but, but no, it's not significant because, with all due respect to the vice president of the United States , we just told our NATO allies a few weeks ago to ignore that 2014 deadline because we're going to be there past 2014 . They went to the NATO conference and they said, ""OK, we know about 2014 , but it's actually going to be extended beyond."" So, if you're keeping score at home on Afghanistan , the generals are winning.  Weve gone from... "
456,MR. SCARBOROUGH: I think... 
457,"MS. MITCHELL: Well, and -- but you have an issue, you have an issue, Andrea ... "
458,"MR. GREGORY: ...2011 to 2014 , now beyond. "
459,"MR. SCARBOROUGH: ...in Pakistan where, if, if insurgents and al-Qaeda can still hide in the sanctuaries in Pakistan , what are we going to turn, turn over to? "
460,"MR. GREGORY: Look, you've had U.S. officials this very week saying that it was the Pakistan intelligence service that outed our CIA station chief there. Whether or not they have evidence of that, that shows the attitude, the lack of cooperation. As long as Pakistan is such a pit, really, of instability, and a nuclear-armed country , you're not going to have the outcome in Afghanistan you want. "
461,MS. MITCHELL: Our two partners... 
462,"MR. SCARBOROUGH: But what they are really doing now is forecasting a, a way out. Whether Barack Obama is there to see this way out in 2014 , I think they think it is critical. Just last night, I was with an officer who is just back and has been told they have to return. And I stood and watched the look in his -- it was a male officer... "
463,MS. MITCHELL: Mm-hmm. 
464,MR. GREGORY: ...looked at his wife and saw the tears welling up in her eyes as they're acknowledging what's happening in their life. He has just returned from a tour. We cannot sustain these multiple tours. 
465,"MS. MITCHELL: By the way, this has been going on for a decade. "
466,MR. SCARBOROUGH: That's exactly why there has... 
467,"MS. MITCHELL: The generals want us to stay there for another decade, and I guarantee you we're not out of there in 2014 if they continue, if they continue to take the course they're taking. "
468,MR. SCARBOROUGH: Right. 
469,MR. GREGORY: I think public sentiment turns to... 
470,MAYOR BOOKER: And our allies are Karzai and Pakistan . That is a nightmare. 
471,"MR. SCARBOROUGH: But, Mayor, you say public sentiment -- I mean, the public is already saying it's not worth it. "
472,MR. GREGORY: I think -- and you also have a president now that is saying... 
473,"MAYOR BOOKER: Yeah, right. "
474,"MR. GREGORY: ...is giving firm deadlines and a clarification of what our role -- we're not nation -building. We're trying to disrupt and dismantle terrorism. That's a singular mission, and we're going to get that done as soon as possible. "
475,"MAYOR BOOKER: All right. Let me, let me get a, let me get a break in here. "
476,MR. SCARBOROUGH: 
477,MR. GREGORY: But we are nation building . 
478,"MR. SCARBOROUGH: Let me get a break in here, a quick break. We'll come back with final thoughts from our roundtable right after this. "
479,"MR. GREGORY: Just a minute here to button up our conversation. Well, if you've seen Time magazine , Person of the Year , Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook . And Mayor Booker, you spent a little time with Mr. Zuckerberg this year. It's not just Facebook , but what he's trying to do for education in your town is significant . "
480,"MR. GREGORY: It's inspiring. Look, the greatest threat to our national security in a noble- -in a global knowledge-based economy is education. You cannot have a first class democracy and not even be in the top 10 in the globe in reading, science and math. "
481,MAYOR BOOKER: Mm. 
482,"MR. SCARBOROUGH: In fact, the math not even in the top 15. So it's great to see Mark Zuckerberg , who I think is a genius in creating wealth, creating connections, really manifesting in a, in a virtual way, this interwoven destinies that we have. But him doubling down on education like Broad , like Gates , like Walton and so many others, is... "
483,"MAYOR BOOKER: And it is, like I say, it's the new form of American patriotism . We're going to really see a big push on this next year, that the competitiveness of America is tied to how well our kids are doing in schools. "
484,"MR. GREGORY: It's not tied, it's actually, it's more than tied. It's essential. If we do not have a great education system , we will fail as a democracy . "
485,MAYOR BOOKER: And the Asian countries are completely outdistancing us. 
486,MS. MITCHELL: Right. 
487,MR. GREGORY: That should -- that should be our new moon shot. 
488,MR. McKINNON: That's why cities like Newark ... 
489,MAYOR BOOKER: It really should be. 
490,MR. McKINNON: Yeah. 
491,"MR. GREGORY: ...and Oakland and San Antonio , that's where the destiny of America 's going to be formed. "
492,MAYOR BOOKER: We got to... 
493,"MR. McKINNON: And for the new year let's hope President Obama , Michael Bloomberg , Cory Booker , conservatives altogether, education reform . "
494,MR. SCARBOROUGH: Yeah. This is why we're all coming together. 
495,MAYOR BOOKER: You guys could do some great things this year. 
496,"MR. SCARBOROUGH: Want to -- that's a good note to leave on. Before we go this morning, Andrea mentioned it.  We remember Richard Holbrooke , President Obama 's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan , died Monday at the age of 69. An iconic American diplomat, Holbrooke worked for every Democratic president since John F. Kennedy , was perhaps best known for negotiating an end, of course, to the Bosnian War in 1995 . He appeared on this program five times over his long career. His first appearance back in 1976 was not as a newsmaker -- look at that -- but as managing editor of Foreign Policy magazine when he was part of a panel of journalists questioning Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin . His family and loved ones are in our thoughts and prayers this morning. That is all for today. We will -- we'll be back next week, the day after Christmas , a special discussion on the incredible political year of 2010 , and what to look for in 2011 and 2012 . "
497,"MR. GREGORY: Tom Brokaw, Doris Kearns Goodwin , Peggy Noonan and Bob Woodward . In the meantime, we wish you and your family a very merry Christmas . If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

MR. GREGORY:
Good morning. Before departing to 
Hawaii
 to join his family for the 
Christmas holiday
, the president picked up
"
13,"
several major legislative victories during this lame duck session of Congress:
the 
tax cut
 deal, the repeal of the ban on 
gays in the military

PRES. OBAMA:

American people

MR. GREGORY:
And here to talk with us about the president's agenda heading into

Valerie Jarrett
. 
Happy holidays
, 
Valerie
. Welcome back to 
MEET THE PRESS
.
"
18,"
MS. VALERIE JARRETT:
Thank you, 
David
, and same to you and your family, of 
course
.
"
19,"
MR. GREGORY:
Thank you. ""A season of progress,"" the president called it. And it was just 
November 3
 the president was talking about a shellacking that he was responsible for in the 
midterm election
. Then some unexpected victories in this 
lame duck session
. What happened in that interim time, from the president's point of view? Was there a 
course
 correction that he ushered in?
"
20,"
MS. JARRETT:
Well, I think as the president said right after the 
election
, what we heard and what the nation said during the 
election
 is, is that they really wanted to see 
Congress
 and the president and the administration in 
Washington
 working together. They wanted us to deliver on behalf of the 
American people
. 
And I
 think what we saw over the 
course
 of the last few weeks is just that. We made enormous progress, as you pointed out, from the 
taxes
 where, you know, everyone, when they get their next paycheck, instead of their 
taxes
 going up, they're going to go down with a 
payroll tax
, with an 
earned income tax credit
, with a 
child care
 tax credit, with a credit so that we can afford to send 
children
 to 
college
, and, and importantly, a credit so that companies will invest and they can take a hundred percent of their expenses now to create jobs for 
America
. So that sends a very positive signal. 
The START
treaty
, probably the president's single most important 
foreign policy
 accomplishment. In fact, the, the most successful 
treaty
 in the -- in decades was just passed as well. And then you mentioned ""Don't_Ask,_Don't_Tell."" Now we'll be able to have 
gays and lesbians
 serve their 
country
 proudly in the 
military
. And it's a 
military
 that's based on trust, and so now they'll be able to serve proudly and represent our 
country
. These are all major accomplishments that were achieved on a bipartisan basis with 
Congress
 and the president, both sides of the aisle working together.
"
21,"
MR. GREGORY:
You know, the vice president, who was on the 
program
 last week, responded to a question of mine about when people think about the president, do they -- are they able to sort of pin him down? You know, what is he exactly? A liberal, moderate, a centrist or what? And he had, he had this response in part. I want to play it for you.
"
22,"

"
23,"
VICE PRES. JOE BIDEN:
What he is, is he is a progressive leader who, in fact, understands that politics is all in the art of the, the possible.
"
24,"

"
25,"
MR. GREGORY:
And that's -- ""the art of the possible,"" to a lot of observers, is a marked 
change
 from how he campaigned as somebody who was going to 
change
Washington
, 
change
 the way 
Washington
 operated. Has he made a shift in his own mind to say, ""I've got to 
change
 tactics here, I've got to 
change
 strategy here in order to achieve some of the things that I want to achieve""?
"
26,"
MS. JARRETT:
No, I don't think so. I think the president that we are seeing now is a -- is the same 
person
 that I've known for over 20 years. When the president was in the 
state Senate
, he had a reputation for being able to work very closely with people 
on the other side
 of the aisle and forge that compromise that's pragmatic. He never lets the perfect be the enemy of the good, and I think that that's his reputation. Early on in the administration I think the 
Republicans
 made a concerted decision to really oppose what we did. 
And I
 think what we saw after the midterm is a president who said, ""I'm going to reach out more, I'm going to try harder,"" and they reciprocated. And that's, I think, what the people want.
"
27,"
MR. GREGORY:
And is that really the issue here? The tax deal sort of cleared out some of the underbrush here, and now there's more 
opportunity
 for real engagement, real agreement?
"
28,"
MS. JARRETT:
Well, I hope so. I mean, I don't know about clearing out the underbrush. I think it's an example of what we can do when everybody says, ""What's most important to me?"" And what the president said was most important to him was not to raise 
taxes
 on the 
middle class
, was to make sure that those who were unemployed have 13 months of benefits. Those are the ones who are going to go out, they're going to pay their rent, they're going to buy groceries, they're going to buy other household supplies, they're going to be able to afford 
Christmas
 presents for their 
children
. That's going to grow the 
economy
 and create jobs. What was important to the 
Republicans
 was to have 
tax breaks
 for the very wealthy and the 
estate tax
 provisions. And so when you marry the two, you ended up with a package that was able to get the bipartisan 
support
 that we needed.
"
29,"
MR. GREGORY:
But the, the...
"
30,"
MS. JARRETT:
So in a sense, everybody got what they wanted.
"
31,"
MR. GREGORY:
But this was a candidate who wrote in one of the memoirs that extending 
Bush tax cuts
 for the wealthy was morally troubling. So a lot of the core supporters who came out in, in unprecedented numbers in 
2008
 see this as caving, or they see it as weakness. They don't see it as somebody who is a progressive, who believes that politics is the art of the possible.
"
32,"
MS. JARRETT:
Well, I guess what I would say is what the president wakes up every morning focusing on is what's best for the 
American people
, what's not -- not what's in his short-term 
political
 calculus, but what's really important to the 
American people
. And what he did not want to have happen on 
January 1
 was to see our 
economy
 that, although it is improving, is still very fragile. And he did not want to have people see their 
taxes
 go up, and he knew that's what was going to happen. So he wasn't looking for a peer 
victory
. He wasn't going to just 
fight
 just to 
fight
 and take that chance. And so, what he realized is that he had to be pragmatic, but he was being pragmatic in order to deliver for the 
American people
. And that's really what I think you have to focus your attention for, and that's what he views every decision he makes. He has two priorities -- and the vice president said this, again, last week on your show -- grow our 
economy
, create jobs; and keep 
America
 safe.
"
33,"
MR. GREGORY:
But he...
"
34,"
MS. JARRETT:
And so every decision he makes is measured against that test.
"
35,"
MR. GREGORY:
But still, as president, you do have to 
fight
 some things. He talked about it after the midterms. You got to 
fight
 how things are done in 
Washington
. He told 
Jon Stewart
 recently that ""yes, we can"" is still ""yes, we can,"" but ""yes, we can, but."" I mean, is that now the story of the next year, that that 
Obama
 agenda has to be tempered by the realities of 
Washington
?
"
36,"
MS. JARRETT:
Well, we do have to accept the realities that the 
Republicans
 did win the 
House
. And so they now have a responsibility to lead as well. And we can't ignore the realities of the membership and the makeup of 
Congress
, and the fact that we are going to need bipartisan 
support
 to get things done. That is a reality. There are certain things the president won't compromise. So, for example, the 
Republicans
 wanted the 
high income
tax breaks
 to be permanent. And what the president said is, ""No, we can't afford it. In the new year, we're really going to have to tackle our deficit, and so we're not going to extend those 
tax breaks
 for the very wealthy indefinitely. We can't afford it, and it's going to be important that we control our deficit and, and we tighten our belts."" So that's something he is willing to 
fight
 for, and we'll see in the next year and the year after that he's going to 
fight
 very hard when those two-year extensions expire to cut off the 
income
 break for the very wealthy.
"
37,"
MR. GREGORY:
You, you are, among other parts of your portfolio, someone who is a liaison with the 
business community
 in 
America
 from the 
White House
 for this president. The president's had a strained relationship with the 
business community
, I don't have to tell you that. He's acknowledged it. He did so after the 
midterm election
, talked about bankers as fat cats, and, and others that led business to really think that he was hostile toward them. What does this tax package do to get people back to work, and what is the new area of cooperation between the 
White House
 and the 
business community
 to get the 
economy
 moving?
"
38,"
MS. JARRETT:
Well, let's 
put it in
 context and let's, let's keep in mind what was going on when the president took office. Our 
financial institutions
 were crumbling, on the break of disaster. Our 
economy
 was in a free fall. The 
stock market
 was crashing. People were seeing their life savings destroyed. Businesses were, were having to lay off people -- in fact, the last six months of the prior administration we lost four million jobs. It was a, it was a period of turmoil. And the president had to take several bold and decisive steps, some of them unpopular, to right our 
economy
 and get us on the right track. Just last week, the president had a group of about 20 
CEOs
 from around the 
country
 come in and talk about how can we grow the 
economy
? How can we get some of the dollars that have been sitting on the balance sheet invested? And it was a very good session where we spent four and a half hours really talking about what we have in common. 
And I
 think what you're going to see going forward is an enormous amount of cooperation around exports, around 
free trade
, making sure that the 
Korean Free Trade Agreement
 where the president lobbied very hard to open up export opportunities for 
U.S.
 companies gets passed through 
Congress
; focusing on public education, making sure that our 
community colleges
 are training people in a way where there'll be real jobs at the end of the training. There's so many ways that businesses and, and the president are aligned right now. And what he said to them is, ""Look, if you guys succeed, if you create jobs, if you invest in 
America
, if we're able to help you compete in a globally competitive marketplace, then the 
country
 wins."" And that's what the president wants.
"
39,"
MR. GREGORY:
The president spoke after the midterms about a difficulty that he has had connecting with the 
American people
, living in the bubble of the 
White House
 and being in the bubble of the 
presidency
. He talked about, as I said, after the midterm. Let me play a portion of what he said.
"
40,"

"
41,"
PRES. OBAMA:
When you're in this place, it is hard not to seem removed, and one of the challenges that we've got to think about is, is, is how do I meet my responsibilities here in the 
White House
, which require a lot of -- lot of hours and a lot of work, you know, but still, you know, have that 
opportunity
 to engage with the 
American people
 on a, on a day-to-day basis and know -- give, give them confidence that I'm listening to them.
"
42,"

"
43,"
MR. GREGORY:
You know him as well or better than anybody working in the 
White House
.
"
44,"
MS. JARRETT:
Yes.
"
45,"
MR. GREGORY:
How does he do a better job of connecting with the 
American people
 when so many are hurting?
"
46,"
MS. JARRETT:
Well, he often says that this is his biggest regret, is that when he took office, because of the crisis that was presented to him, he had to spend almost every waking hour in 
Washington
 focusing very hard on solving that crisis, and what he missed sorely was the engagement with the 
American people
. He said it right before he left for vacation. He said, ""When I get back, I really want to figure out a way where I can spend more time outside of 
Washington
 listening and learning and engaging with the 
American people
."" It's really what gives him his 
energy
 and his strength, and so we're determined in the new year to make sure that his schedule reflects that priority.
"
47,"
MR. GREGORY:
We are in midst of a 
permanent campaign
, and the, the campaign of 
2012
 is already 
upon us
. 
And I
 found it interesting in one of the president's recent interviews, he said about a potential presidential aspirant, 
Sarah Palin
, that he doesn't think about her. Do you think he should?
"
48,"
MS. JARRETT:
Well, you know what I think? As the president of the 
United States
, his obligation is to think about all of 
Americans
 every day. He has to wake up in the morning, he has to think about growing our 
economy
, he has to think about keeping us safe. He needs to keep focused on the on the prize, and I believe...
"
49,"
MR. GREGORY:
But he also thinks about 
political
 opponents.
"
50,"
MS. JARRETT:
Well, but you know what, I think as president his job is really to focus first on that. And if he does that job well...
"
51,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
52,"
MS. JARRETT:
...if he looks out for 
America
, if it's clear that he's doing everything he can to make sure that hard-working 
Americans
 who've lost their jobs can go back to work, and if he keeps 
America
 safe and he demonstrates that, 24/7, that's his priority, then I think the politics will take care of itself.
"
53,"
MR. GREGORY:
Do you think he should be paying to attention to her as a 
political
 threat?
"
54,"
MS. JARRETT:
I think he shouldn't be distracted by what are perceived as threats. I mean, I think -- I really go back to what I'm saying. Because he's the president of the 
United States
, he's not out there running the way he was before when he was the 
U.S. senator
, where you have to think about everybody in the field every second of the day. The American people expect him to lead. He's their president, he's everybody's president regardless of 
party
 affiliation. And that doesn't mean that at some point he's not going to get out there and, and launch a campaign. But the most important thing that he can do for the 
American people
 is think of them every single day and let them guide his actions.
"
55,"
MR. GREGORY:
Finally, your role in the 
White House
 is unique. I mean, for those of us who, who 
cover
 politics, who 
cover
 administrations, you have a lot of responsibility as an adviser, but you're also one of the president's closest friends and have helped to mentor him and develop him as a 
political
 figure. What role do you play for him in that way? What is unique about it, and how do you help strengthen him?
"
56,"
MS. JARRETT:
Well, I think the president's lucky to be surrounded by a strong group, both within the 
White House
 as well as his 
Cabinet
 of people, who he trusts and who he relies on for advice. I think the fact that I'm a friend who's there, who's known him for a long time, provides me with the ability to be a sounding board in, in one way. But I think that what's important to know about the president is he really listens to a variety of different voices, a diversity of opinion, and that's what really gives him the 
energy
 and the ability to think creatively and innovatively. And when, when you see the president engage with a room full of people, he calls on not just the people he's known for 20 years, but the new stranger who's walked in the room who might be the junior 
person
 at the table, but who has a new idea for how we can grow our 
country
 and make it strong, how we can compete internationally. He has an almost insatiable appetite for new ideas from wherever he goes. When he's walking along a rope line, oftentimes people will lean in and whisper suggestions to him, and he comes back and he tells his economic team -- some of the smartest people in the 
country
 -- ""This is what I heard today. What do you think about this idea?"" 
And I
 think that that's what you really want in a president, somebody who's innovative, who's creative, who's always looking for new ideas, and who surrounds himself with a divorce -- diverse and robust group of people. And, and I consider privileged to be at his service.

NBC News
special correspondent

Tom Brokaw
. Welcome to all of you, 
happy holidays
. There's so much to go through. 
Tom Brokaw
, you think about the 
lame duck session
, how this year ends for 
President Obama
, and all these people are talking about the ""comeback kid"" and ""look what he accomplished."" You know, on 
November 3
 in the shellacking of the midterm it wasn't supposed to work out this way. What happened?
"
64,"
MR. TOM BROKAW:
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves here. I mean, we've got a 
long way to go
 and there are a lot of big problems that are still out there. But I do think that he's had a good month, obviously. I think that -- and it's due in a large part to the fact that he seemed to be in charge, that he was leading from the front and not from the back as the guy who was kind of consulting with everybody on the 
Hill
 before he made a decision. He stepped up, and the 
country
 was ready for this kind of action, and the 
Republicans
, I think, to some degree, got caught a little bit flat-footed by his eagerness to get the deal done in the way that he did and the way that he stood down the 
Democrats
 who weren't happy about it.
"
65,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, let's pick up on that, 
Doris
, because at the end of the week he signs a signature piece of legislation, and that is the repeal of ""Don't_Ask,_Don't_Tell,"" which prohibited 
gays and lesbians
 from serving openly in the 
military
. This was a way to mitigate some of the damage on the left, to say, ""Look, this was a 
campaign promise
. I got this done. You may not like that I'm dealing with the 
Republicans
 in other ways, but I got this done."" And on this issue, the, the politics were too difficult for the 
Republicans
 to stay united in opposition.
"
66,"
MS. DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
Right. It's one of those moments when it was an idea whose time had come. And the gay movement deserves a lot of credit for making the whole way we think about gays different now. But it's very fortunate for 
Obama
, I think, that that came at the same time as the 
tax cut
, which a lot of the people on the left were upset about. But, you know, presidents in history are always upset about the people in their own 
party
 who criticize them. And 
Teddy Roosevelt
 used to say, ""Oh, they're 
Tom Foolery
 guys. They're lunatic fringe."" But 
on the other hand
, they need them. They need them to push in from the outside in so that what they can get done is larger than it might otherwise be. So I 
understand
 why he got irritated, but I think, 
on the other hand
, it was great that he had that combination so he could say, ""Yeah, this is -- I did this, but look, 
on the other hand
, I did the 
tax cut
.""
"
67,"
MR. GREGORY:

Bob Woodward
, what's your read on, on the president's strong finish?
"
68,"
MR. BOB WOODWARD:
I mean, it's, it's real, and the, the repeal of ""Don't_Ask,_Don't_Tell"" is a 
big deal
. That's a -- that is a movement in 
civil rights
...
"
69,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Right.
"
70,"
MR. WOODWARD:
...that will be noted for a long time and perhaps forever. At the same time, there, there's something about 
Obama
 that is not connecting with the people. 
And I
 was trying to think, you know, what is that? And somebody was telling me about this wake and gathering that 
Richard Holbrooke
's widow, 
Kati
, had in 
New York
 after he died. 
Holbrooke
 being the Afghan/
Pakistan
 negotiator for 
Obama
 who died. And at this gathering, 
Bill Clinton
 walked in. And, of 
course
, 
Clinton
 always takes over a room, and he put his arm around 
Kati
, the widow, and started talking and saying that 
Richard Holbrooke
 had been somebody who always fought, who believed in peace. And somebody who was there told me, he said suddenly everyone in the room was involved in 
Bill Clinton
's emotions. And that's what 
Obama
 has to do. He has to find a way to make these things personal, not abstract. He's so cerebral, he's so smart, he appears cool. And he's got to get in there and make those connections with, with the people in the unemployment line, the 
assembly line
, in the mountains of 
Afghanistan
.
"
71,"
MS. GOODWIN:
You know, I agree with you. But the very steadiness that allowed him to come back from 
Scott Brown
's 
victory
, which seemed like he was dead in January, and then he brought 
health care
...
"
72,"
MR. GREGORY:
Who succeeded 
Ted Kennedy
, of 
course
.
"
73,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Exactly. And now allowed him to come back from the shellacking in the midterm, that's a strength to neither be too high or too low, and to keep that steadiness. I'm sure at times you want him to yell, you want him to 
fight
, you want him to show more emotion, but maybe those qualities don't often come together in the same 
person
.
"
74,"
MR. WOODWARD:
But as, as a manager, he did a great job. It's masterful. But as something connecting with the average voter, he's not yet there, and that's how you win.

MS. PEGGY NOONAN:
Can I throw in, too?

MR. WOODWARD:
Yeah.
"
78,"
MS. NOONAN:
I got -- on an issue like -- considering the president's position right now, an issue like ""Don't_Ask,_Don't_Tell"" is perfect. Here's why. It's a liberal issue, it's a left issue, fine. But it was in line with centrist thinking. The center supported the 
change
. When a president of the left can make leftist moves with centrist 
support
, he's going to be OK. Rightist president, the same thing. So always keep in, in mind the center. I would say also, 
Bob
, as, as an extenuation to your remarks, I think the president has to regain his mystique, you know. The 
presidency
 has a mystique, it has certain weight. It has a, a certain gravitational pull. I think the president walked into the 
White House
 with a certain mystique. I think he lost it in his first two years. He needs to gain it back. That's my read.
"
79,"
MR. GREGORY:

Tom
, I want to pull out a little bit farther, but before I do, I want to follow up on something specific about ""Don't_Ask,_Don't_Tell."" There's still a lot of questions about how this gets implemented, and then there's another question about 
military recruiting
 on 
college
 campuses. My own wife, as you know, was part of the 
ROTC
program
 at 
Princeton
, as a lot of 
Americans
 were who were in the 
military
 and are no longer in the 
military
. Is that the next step here, to take that on?
"
80,"
MR. BROKAW:
Well, take it on is quite another question. The 
military
 has mixed feelings about whether they want to go back to 
Harvard
, go back to 
Columbia
, go back to the 
Ivy League
 schools. It's expensive.
"
81,"
MR. GREGORY:
Hm.
"
82,"
MR. BROKAW:

ROTC
 programs, and it's whether they get a big enough bang for their buck. Do they get enough kids who sign up for it at the elite institutions to go into a commissioned 
program
 of some kind? Or are they better off working at the 
land grant
 schools where they're going to get generally a greater response to it. So that's an issue. Now, the 
Ivy League
 and elite institutions are beginning to say, ""We would welcome them back, we want to open that conversation again,"" because of the repeal of ""Don't_Ask,_Don't_Tell."" But you may find the 
military
 saying, you know, ""I'm not sure that we need to go there because, frankly, it's just not a 
happy hunting ground
 for us. We're not going to get that many people.""
"
83,"
MR. WOODWARD:
No, but it's important. I did 
naval ROTC
 in 
college
 back...
"
84,"
MR. BROKAW:
Yeah.
"
85,"
MR. WOODWARD:
...in, you know, the 
Coolidge administration
 or whenever it was.
"
86,"
MR. BROKAW:
Right.
"
87,"
MR. WOODWARD:
And it is...
"
88,"
MR. BROKAW:
Not Wilson.
"
89,"
MR. WOODWARD:
It is important for the 
military
 to connect there with exactly the point you made recently...
"
90,"
MR. BROKAW:
Right.
"
91,"
MR. WOODWARD:
...in your op/ed piece...
"
92,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
93,"
MR. WOODWARD:
...about this disconnect between those who serve and people who kind of say, ""Oh, no, not that, that's not for me."" And one way to do that is to, to bring it, bring it -- bring 
ROTC
 everywhere.
"
94,"
MR. BROKAW:
Well, here's what I think, 
Bob
. I've actually been thinking about this a fair amount, and I -- what I would do is, if not do it campus by campus, if you go to 
Boston
, for example, you could do an 
MIT
/
Harvard
program
 and put a couple of the institutions together and have a central 
ROTC
program
 drawing on all the institutions. If you do it by institution by institution, with the questions that the 
military
 already has about a lot of costs -- you got to put officers in those programs and training programs -- they may be better to do something that is more centralized.
"
95,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let, let me, let me bring it back to some of the wider challenges that the president has faced this year. We can look at what's happened in the last couple of weeks, he had a strong finish, but this has been a tough year for the president, for 
Democrats
. 
AP
 wrote about it, in summing it up, and started with the passage of 
healthcare reform
. Quoting the president, ""'This is what 
change
 looks like,' 
Obama
 said proudly, after the 
health care
 law passed. ""But the economic recovery was too slow. The oil gushed for too long. The 
health care
 laws was too complicated. The 
unemployment rate
 too high. The 
political discourse
 too raw. The 
tea party
 too loud. 
Americans
 were in a foul mood, and 
Democrats
 got the blame."" That's really the story of 
2010
.
"
96,"
MS. NOONAN:
Well, it's not -- the way that's written, it suggests it was a matter of fate. Oh, my goodness, decisions were made, they were not popular. You know, 
health care
, two years into this drama, you can look at it, look at the numbers, and you realize people just don't love that. That, that was just the wrong...
"
97,"
MR. BROKAW:
They don't 
understand
 it.
"
98,"
MS. GOODWIN:
They don't 
understand
 it, yeah.
"
99,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
100,"
MS. NOONAN:
Well, when you're two years in and they still, everywhere across the 
country
, are scratching their heads, that is almost the definition of a bad idea.
"
101,"
MR. BROKAW:
Right.
"
102,"
MR. GREGORY:
But, 
Tom
, do they not 
understand
 it, or do they 
understand
 too well...
"
103,"
MS. NOONAN:
And the president gave his first 18 months to it.
"
104,"
MR. GREGORY:
...that in fact it's going to help 
poor people
 in a tight 
economy
?
"
105,"
MR. BROKAW:
Well, there are two different answers to that, 
David
. I think that a lot of small businesses 
understand
 it very well, and they say, ""It's going to cost us more money, and we're going to move our employees into the 
Medicaid
program
 or something else for their -- we're not going to be able to afford to 
cover
 them."" People who are looking at it 
from the ground up
 are saying, ""I don't get it."" And it's 2,700 pages. Most of the major 
health
 institutions that I know in this 
country
 who are going to be responsible for the care are still trying to sort their way through it. At the very highest levels, they don't quite 
understand
 how it's going to work.
"
106,"
MS. GOODWIN:
You know, I think one of the...
"
107,"
MS. NOONAN:
Just politically, it was a misjudgment.
"
108,"
MR. BROKAW:
Right.
"
109,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Well, I'm not sure it was a misjudgment, but I think...
"
110,"
MS. NOONAN:
Just a waste of time and reputation.
"
111,"
MS. GOODWIN:
You mean to even do it, you think it was? I, I don't agree with that.
"
112,"
MS. NOONAN:
To go down that road with that bill.
"
113,"
MS. GOODWIN:
But I think that what hasn't been done, you know, 
Bill Safire
 always used to say, when he gave a speech, tell them what you're going to say, then tell them -- and then tell them what you told them. Somehow we never got straight what that, that 
healthcare
 bill was. A lot of people didn't 
understand
 what was in it, and that's a failure of the bully pulpit. Part of that is the rhetoric of the president. Part of it, it's really 
hard to get
 anything out to the 
country
 today because everything is so distracting.
"
114,"
MR. WOODWARD:
I...
"
115,"
MS. GOODWIN:
You give a speech on 
health care
 and the guy says, 
Joe Wilson
 says, ""You lie,"" and that becomes the story.
"
116,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
117,"
MR. WOODWARD:
No, no, but I actually met somebody who read it, the whole thing, read it twice, and he, he confessed he didn't 
understand
 it.
"
118,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Oh, that's a problem.
"
119,"
MR. WOODWARD:
The complexity and...
"
120,"
MS. NOONAN:
Yeah.
"
121,"
MR. WOODWARD:
Now, one of the...
"
122,"
MS. NOONAN:
The......a lot of it was just slapped in there. Nobody knows what's it all -- interpretive.
"
123,"
MR. WOODWARD:
I don't think the 
health care
 and, and where that's going or, you know, how it gets changed or implemented is a peril to the 
Obama
presidency
. I think there are other things, like the threat of terrorism, very, very real. And...
"
124,"
MR. BROKAW:
And it's systemic unemployment, 
Bob
. That's the -- they missed the pass on that.
"
125,"
MR. WOODWARD:
Yes. That's...
"
126,"
MR. BROKAW:
Systemic unemployment. When they -- when it goes up 2 point -- when it goes up two-tenths of a point right before the 
election
 after they thought that they were on the right direction, that is a big signal. And my own guess is that it's probably a 12 or 13 percent of those people who are not looking for jobs anymore.
"
127,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Right.
"
128,"
MR. GREGORY:
But on 
Peggy
's point, I think, whether it's about 
health care
, the 
government
 stepped up, took some big whacks at policy, namely dealing with the 
economy
, and a lot of people said, ""Well, wait a minute, nothing's worked here. You know, you bailed out the banks -- started under 
Bush
, you continued it -- the auto companies, you did 
health care
, you did the stimulus, and we're still in the same position. I still don't have any equity in my 
house
 anymore, and I can't find a job."" That's a role of 
government
 issue.
"
129,"
MS. NOONAN:
There's also this, this -- growing from that, but part of what we're talking about is this -- the biggest 
political
change
 in the 
United States
 in my lifetime is the sense grown-ups have that their 
children
 will not have it better. It is a -- we are a happy people. You can walk along any street in 
America right
 now...
"
130,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
131,"
MS. NOONAN:
...and you can see people just doing 
Christmas
 and the 
holidays
, and it's wonderful. But there is deep down, on the third level of thought, a, a strain of pessimism that I've never seen before.
"
132,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, and, 
Peggy
, look at this from our recent 
NBC News
/
Wall Street Journal
 poll, people's views on the last -- on this last decade, that it's the worst decade in history at 54 percentile.
"
133,"
MS. NOONAN:
Ah.
"
134,"
MR. BROKAW:
Yeah.
"
135,"
MS. NOONAN:
Well, part of that is 
big things
 happened at the beginning.
"
136,"
MR. BROKAW:
But part of that because they're living through it.
"
137,"
MS. NOONAN:

Well...

"
138,"
MR. BROKAW:
Well, let me take them back to 
1938
, for example...
"
139,"
MS. NOONAN:
Yeah, exactly.
"
140,"
MR. BROKAW:
...when the prospect of war and 
World War II
, and the, and the recovery wasn't working as well as 
FDR
 had hoped it would in that year, and we still had bread lines in 
America
, and the 
country
 was on its backside at that point.
"
141,"
MS. NOONAN:
And we were hopeful.
"
142,"
MR. BROKAW:
And, and how about the, how about the...
"
143,"
MS. NOONAN:
Do you -- it was dreadful.
"
144,"
MR. BROKAW:
...worst decade leading up to the 
Civil War
, you know?
"
145,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Yeah. And for those of us who are historians and who've lived in those other decades...
"
146,"
MR. BROKAW:
Right.
"
147,"
MS. GOODWIN:
...the 
1860s
, the 
1930s
, I'll still take this one, as troubling as it is.
"
148,"
MR. GREGORY:
What about 
course
 correction, though? Because, 
Bob
, you talked about connecting, and this issue of how the president positions himself to deal with the pessimism, to deal with systemic unemployment, the threat of terror. Politico wrote something interesting about ""
Obama
 2.0: 
Reinventing
 the 
Presidency
,"" and wrote -- they wrote this: ""'He needs to be CEO of 
America
,' said former 
White House chief of staff
John Podesta
, an 
Obama
 sympathizer who ran his transition to power after the '
08 election
 and is now urging him to dramatically refashion his 
presidency
. ""
The West Wing
 makeover, as 
Podesta
 and others see it, would involve 
Obama
 no longer 'being 
Velcroed
 to the 
Hill
' and giving more attention to powers of the 
presidency
 that don't involve signing bills into the law."" In other words, legislating is not good for popularity.
"
149,"
MR. WOODWARD:
That's true. But if you've -- you talk to economists, 
CEOs
, the one theme that comes through all of this in terms of the 
economy
, you need a plan.
"
150,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
151,"
MR. WOODWARD:
And you need a plan that's not one year or two years, you need a long range plan. And no politician in the modern era has figured out to present a 10-year plan that he or she could sell politically.
"
152,"
MR. GREGORY:
Hm.
"
153,"
MR. WOODWARD:
And -- because the problems in the 
economy
 are, are structural. They -- it's not something you can tinker with, it's something that -- you get a CEO on 
Sodium Pentathol
 here, truth serum, and say, you know, ""How do you fix these things?"" And they'll say, ""Well, what's your 10-year plan, your eight-year plan?"" And so he's 
got to find a way
 to make that politically salable. Whether he can, we'll see.
"
154,"
MS. GOODWIN:
I think there's a way of having a bold vision. I mean, think about what 
FDR
 did in 
1940
. We were still coming out of the depression, we had the war in 
Europe
 to worry about, but he mobilized the 
economy
 in a fantastic way. He brought in 
CEOs
 to run his production agencies. I think 
Obama
 could do something similar like that. He, he gave much bigger appreciation, deceleration 
tax credits
 to business, and they came through to produce the ships, the tanks, and the weapons. Right now, if he were to go for 
alternative energy
 in a bigger way than he has, if he would get these 
CEOs
 and say, ""What kind of 
tax credits
 do you need to keep jobs here in this 
country
?"" there's a way of making 
America
 competitive in the world again, be number one economically.
"
155,"
MR. WOODWARD:
But he had that war, and that was, you know, that was the engine that drove it economically.
"
156,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Of 
course
, it's easier -- but you can make things. You can't believe that that's all it has to be. I mean, you got to believe that, you know?
"
157,"
MR. WOODWARD:
Maybe that's the answer.
"
158,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, let me get a break in here. We'll come back and talk specifically
"
159,"
about some of the challenges ahead:
spending, the war in 
Afghanistan
, and the 
political
 landscape which is already taking shape for 
2012
. More from our 
roundtable
 right after this.
"
160,"

"
161,"
MR. GREGORY:
We are back, joined again by our 
political
roundtable
. 
And I
 want to talk about some of the specific challenges the president faces. There are some tough issues out there. I think the first one is best summed up by 
Merriam
 and the 
word of the year
 for 
2010
, we'll put it up on the screen. It is austerity. It is a noun, ""enforced or extreme 
economy
."" 
Tom Brokaw
, that's what 
Washington
 is, is going to be grappling with, which is 
government
's got to shrink, it's got to spend less. It's how to go about doing it.
"
162,"
MR. BROKAW:
Yeah. Well, you know, in fact, if you go across the 
country
, you find a lot of families who are already doing that. More, more women are saying to me, ""I buy an extra edition of the Sunday paper just to get the coupons. 
And I
'm going -- I used to make fun of people in the grocery stores with coupons; I'm now clipping them myself."" 
On the other hand
, when they make a decision to close a 
military base
 in whatever 
state
, a Republican or a 
Democratic state
, or when they're going to shut down an agricultural substation, you're always going to get the pushback from the 
special interest
. The community's going to say, ""They can't do that. I mean, that's our whole 
economy
."" So this is going to be a very tricky piece. 
Mitch McConnell
 said the other day, the president's in for a big 
fight
 here. But the 
Republicans
 have got a lot of pressure on them as well because they made some big promises about how much they can cut spending. And we're not going to kick-start the 
economy
 just by cutting spending and by cutting 
taxes
. There are, as I said a moment ago, some real structural issues that we have to deal with here. Innovation is way behind the curve about what's be -- about what's going on in 
Vietnam
 and 
India
 and 
China
, and even in the 
Middle East
, for that matter. And we're not addressing that by this 
political rhetoric
.
"
163,"
MS. NOONAN:
I think you
"
164,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, and that is -- I've asked this question, 
Peggy
, to numerous guests over
"
165,"
the past several weeks:
Do we have the balance right between austerity and what 
Tom
 mentioned, innovation?
"
166,"
MR. BROKAW:
Yeah.
"
167,"
MR. GREGORY:
Are we done investing in our 
economy
 to ultimately be competitive before we can deal with this long-term debt picture?
"
168,"
MS. NOONAN:
Well, that's a huge one. I mean, that's going to be worked out over, over the next few years. I'm thinking as, as 
Tom
 was speaking, we have 40 million 
Americans
 on food stamps.
"
169,"
MR. BROKAW:
Yeah.
"
170,"
MS. NOONAN:
We have a lot of people in distress and a lot of people getting help from the 
government
. It is true that we have to cut spending. I mean, everybody can make that speech. But it's going to be really difficult at the same time entrenched interests that are winding up costing a heck of a lot of money in American, such as, as municipal and 
state
 employee unions with pension benefits, etc. Every 
state
 is going bankrupt. They all have to look at the price of things. I don't know if austerity is really the right word.
"
171,"
MS. GOODWIN:
I think -- it's an odd word.
"
172,"
MS. NOONAN:
This is the -- yeah. This is some grinding of levers.
"
173,"
MS. GOODWIN:
It is. 
And I
 think it -- in a certain sense, there's a difference -- austerity means sort of self-discipline. Shared sacrifice means you're doing something for a higher object. Like for example, during 
World War II
, they, they called what we were wearing ""austerity clothing."" It meant trousers that didn't have cuffs anymore. No vests, it meant two-piece bathing suits to save cloth, so you didn't have a one-piece bathing suit. But you knew you were doing it...
"
174,"
MR. WOODWARD:
That's where those came from.
"
175,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Yeah! It was a good -- but you knew you were doing it for a 
common cause
, and I think leadership strength has to be right now, if we're going to go through an austere period, to convince us that something more than just undoing the deficit, that we're investing in the future at the same time as we're being austere.
"
176,"
MR. WOODWARD:
But, but...
"
177,"
MS. NOONAN:
Which involves trust. Leaders you trust.
"
178,"
MS. GOODWIN:
That's exactly right.
"
179,"
MS. NOONAN:
Who, when they say, ""Everybody's going to take a haircut, everybody's going to get -- have some difficulties but we can all get through it together, we're a great nation,"" that's the difficult part.
"
180,"
MR. WOODWARD:
But, but there's all this talk about cutting spending, and then they don't do it. Of 
course
, the 
tax cut
 deal, what, is going to add 800...
"
181,"
MR. BROKAW:
A trillion dollars.
"
182,"
MR. WOODWARD:
...almost $1 trillion to the deficit, and if you go back -- I happened to recently be reading 
Ronald Reagan
's own autobiography, and in there he says -- and he's identified with somebody who tried to cut 
government
 -- and in it he in a very confessional way says, ""One of my biggest disappointments as president, I was not able to do this in"" -- he says, ""I've let down the people on this issue."" So if 
Ronald Reagan
 couldn't cut spending who's going to do it now?
"
183,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, but...
"
184,"
MS. NOONAN:
He was able to cut the increase, the yearly increase, but he was never able to cut into this huge thing.
"
185,"
MR. WOODWARD:

That's right
.
"
186,"
MR. GREGORY:
But, 
Tom
, what -- you guys -- there are cross-currents in the 
Republican Party
 over just how deeply they want to cut which programs. Are they going to really go after entitlements? Are they going to repeal 
health care
? How does the president navigate this? Because the budget is the big 
fight
 of 
2011
.
"
187,"
MR. BROKAW:
Well, I think part of what he does is take a listen from 
Bill Clinton
. Let them play their own hand for a while and stand back from it and see what happens within their 
party
. Look, there's going to be more pressure coming 
from the ground up
 in the 
Republican Party
 than we can now fully anticipate in these 
tea party
 members who are coming in. And when they come to increase the debt limit in June or down, down the pike a little ways or shut down the 
government
, the 
tea party
 people who have come in on this wave of populism within the 
Republican Party
 are going to push back very hard. 
Peggy
 was close witness to this, but I was reading as well some of the 
Reagan
 years, and people forget this, in 
1982
 he raised 
taxes
 after cutting them the year before. But they had wonderful language. They called the 
tax cut
 not a tax -- I mean, a tax increase, not a tax increase, they called it revenue enhancement.
"
188,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Right.
"
189,"
MS. NOONAN:
Ah, 
those were the days
. Those were 
the good old days
.
"
190,"
MR. BROKAW:
And 
President Reagan
 also said, and only 
Reagan
 could have gotten away with this, he said -- when he signed the bill and addressed the 
country
 about what he was doing, he said, ""This is really an extension of what we did a year ago when they cut 
taxes
."" To increase 
taxes
 was an extension of that, and somehow they were able to market that.
"
191,"
MR. WOODWARD:
Well, and...
"
192,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, but -- go ahead.
"
193,"
MR. WOODWARD:
...and we're going to have to raise 
taxes
 at some point here, or you don't address the deficit problem. And again, if you go to 
Reagan
, the deal he made with 
Tip O'Neill
, they doubled the 
payroll tax
...
"
194,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Right.
"
195,"
MR. BROKAW:
Right.
"
196,"
MR. WOODWARD:
...which is the most 
regressive tax
 in our system.
"
197,"
MR. GREGORY:
But, 
Peggy
, how do -- how do 
Republicans
 manage here? 
John Boehner
 is the speaker of the 
House
. He's a familiar figure in the Republican range. 
Mitch McConnell
, on the 
Senate
 side, he boasted about making the 
Democrats
 sweat tactically as we get 
into the new
 year. What's this dynamic going to be like?
"
198,"
MS. NOONAN:
Well, it's interesting. They've been -- the 
Republican Party
 has been winning big consequential serious elections throughout '09 and '10. They just won the 
House
, 66 seats, so it is very significant. But they all know the problem is entitlement spending, and if you are going to look at 
where the money is
 spent, you're going to have to decide how exactly do we go at this and how do we go at it, not only among the available remedies on spending, how do we take any one of those remedies without the 
presidency
? Do you 
know what I mean
? It'll be highly unusual for a 
party
 that is not holding the 
presidency
, that is only holding the 
House
, to make huge 
change
 here, and yet they have to move forward in a serious way or the people who elected them will be very angry with them.
"
199,"
MR. GREGORY:

Bob Woodward
, another huge challenge is the war in 
Afghanistan
. 
2011
 is the year when troops, American troops will start to come out, the president tells us. The vice president was on the 
program
 last week. I pressed him on this deadline point. And this is what he said about the endgame.
"
200,"

"
201,"
VICE PRES. JOE BIDEN:
The recent 
Lisbon
 conference, the 
NATO
 conference, where we said we're starting this process just like we did in 
Iraq
. We're starting it in July of 
2011
, and we're going to be totally out of there 
come hell or high water
 by 
2014
.
"
202,"

"
203,"
MR. GREGORY:

2014
. Now 
The Wall Street Journal
 took this on in an editorial saying that
"
204,"
this was a mistake. And this is what they wrote in part:
""Mr. 
Biden
's glib rhetoric implying a lack of American 
staying power
 will in particular make it that much harder for 
General Petraeus
 to get the 
support
 of 
Pakistan
's 
military
 in rooting out 
Taliban
 sanctuaries in 
North Waziristan
 and around 
Quetta
."" This is over the border from 
Afghanistan
 and the tribal areas. ""The remarks also undermine months of 
Administration
 effort to downplay its original mistake of setting a 
July 2011
 deadline for beginning to withdraw 
U.S. forces
. 
The U.S.
 and its allies went out of their way at the recent 
NATO summit
 in 
Lisbon
 to extend to 
2014
 the date when Afghan forces will take, 'full responsibility for security' in their 
country
. But even full responsibility does not mean the Afghans won't need some foreign 
military
 help.""
"
205,"
MR. WOODWARD:
Does your head spin? Yes, it does because -- what they've told us is 
the beginning of the end
 of the war is July of next year and the 
end of the war
 is 
2014
. What they haven't told us is how they're going to do it. And how it will work. And there still is this disconnect between 
Obama
 and his 
White House
 and the 
military
 about where this is going. And, you know, if you take that report that they issued after studying this, you know, really for months, they said, ""Well, it -- we've made progress, but it's fragile and reversible."" Now, if you've got ratings in, you know, and you're making progress but it's fragile and reversible -- you're smiling...
"
206,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah.
"
207,"
MR. WOODWARD:
...you know, what does that mean?
"
208,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
209,"
MR. WOODWARD:
That means you're in 
Never Never Land
. That means we don't know.
"
210,"
MR. GREGORY:
But can the president, 
Doris
, make the case that we are still fighting an existential threat in 
Afghanistan
? Does he have to do that in order to maintain some modicum of 
support
?
"
211,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Well, I think one of the things that hasn't happened yet, because he obviously hasn't made that case strong enough, six out of 10 people don't think this is a war worth fighting. In a democracy, you cannot bring soldiers into harm's way unless you're convinced the people that this is a war that we should be fighting. And the threat of 
al-Qaeda
still remains
 the strongest question. If we can prevent and dismantle and disable them from getting back at us, then that's worth doing. But somehow that hasn't penetrated the 
country
, and that's a failure of leadership until that happens.
"
212,"
MS. NOONAN:
It is amazing to me that we are, what, nine years into, into these wars...
"
213,"
MR. BROKAW:

Longest war
 in 
American history
.
"
214,"
MS. NOONAN:
Oh my goodness, and we are not talking about it every day...
"
215,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Right.
"
216,"
MS. NOONAN:
...on the streets and in the cafe and over coffee.
"
217,"
MS. GOODWIN:
It's terrible.
"
218,"
MS. NOONAN:
It is amazing. It's just accepted as a fact that one doesn't comment on.
"
219,"
MR. BROKAW:
That's because less than one percent of the 
country
 is fighting the war. I mean, and 99 percent of the 
country
 nothing is asked of us. I mean...
"
220,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Right.
"
221,"
MS. NOONAN:
Well, then we better get our 
ROTC
 back to 
Harvard.

"
222,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Right.
"
223,"
MR. BROKAW:
And -- well, I don't think that will make the difference, in all due respect, because they have a choice of whether or not they want to join 
ROTC
. They don't have to. It's not mandatory.
"
224,"
MS. NOONAN:
Sure. Of 
course
.
"
225,"
MR. BROKAW:
And so it's 
working class
 -- 
Bob
 and I have talked about this a lot -- 
working class
 families primarily come from the smaller towns in 
America
.
"
226,"
MS. NOONAN:
It always is that.
"
227,"
MR. BROKAW:
They come from a 
military tradition
 of joining. But it's an obligation of all of us as well as the 
political
 leadership of this 
country
 to make sure that it's on the table, not just in forums like this, but on a, on a regular basis. I also think that we're looking at this in old terms. We're looking at, where's the 
victory
 in 
Afghanistan
? 
Afghanistan
 has had 2,000 years of foreign invaders who have crawled out of there without a 
victory
 in conventional terms. And it goes beyond the borders of 
Afghanistan
. We're talking about Islamic rage. I've been in 
Waziristan
 and in the north in the 
Khyber
 region. These are two of the most hostile areas I have ever seen anywhere in the world. And as some of you know, I've been in a lot of bad places.
"
228,"
MR. WOODWARD:
And the problem hasn't been defined with specificity that's necessary. The problem is, in these secret meetings last year, 
Obama
 said the poison is in 
Pakistan
. The problem is in 
Pakistan
. The sanctuaries are there and he decided secretly, ""OK, these sanctuaries are unacceptable now.""
"
229,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me get another break in here. We'll have just a couple of minutes left 
on the other side
 of this break, and we'll at least broach the topic that's already under way, which is, who are the 
Republicans
 going to nominate to challenge 
President Obama
? Some final thoughts from our 
roundtable
 right after this.
"
230,"

"
231,"
MR. GREGORY:
We are back with more from our 
roundtable
, final moments. 
Tom Brokaw
, you know, at this stage of the 
2008
 cycle, we were getting ready for the new year and some new announcements as to who was going to run for president.
"
232,"
MR. BROKAW:
Right.
"
233,"
MR. GREGORY:
So what are 
Republicans
 going to do?
"
234,"
MR. BROKAW:
Well, I -- you know, who knows at this point, 
David
. You've heard me say this a thousand times over, the 
UFO
 theory always holds, the unforeseen will occur. We don't know who they are at this point. It was just 15 months ago that the 
tea party
 was just a faint line on the 
political
 horizon in this 
country
, and then suddenly it was this very powerful force. There are obviously a lot of 
Republicans
 in the 
Senate
 and in the statehouses around the 
country
 who see themselves in the 
Oval Office
. I mean, 
Tim Pawlenty
 is running hard in 
Minnesota
, 
Sarah Palin
, obviously, is more than flirting with the idea. Now, 
Haley Barbour
 probably has banged himself up again a little bit in the last week or so with his comments about the 
white citizens council
, to say nothing of people in the 
United States Senate
, and 
Mitt Romney
, the former governor of 
Massachusetts
. So there's a lot of moving around going on out there.
"
235,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, what kind of candidate, 
Peggy Noonan
, do you need to run as the 
Republican Party
, to take on 
Obama
? What's the theory of the case at this stage?
"
236,"
MS. NOONAN:

Hm
. A big thing is how the tectonic plates 
keep moving
 in 
American politics
. 
Harrison Salisbury
 once said -- a lifetime in journalism, he was asked, ""What did you learn?"" He said, ""Expect the unexpected."" If we've learned anything from the past decade, it's that anybody can arise from anywhere and become a leader.
"
237,"
MR. WOODWARD:
Mm-hmm.
"
238,"
MS. NOONAN:
Gosh, what do the, the 
Republicans
 need to beat 
Obama
? A credible alternative, a serious man or woman, someone with experience and some weight and heft who can get through 
Iowa
 and 
South Carolina
.
"
239,"
MR. WOODWARD:
And so, not 
Sarah Palin
, you're saying, is that right?
"
240,"
MS. NOONAN:
Thank you, 
Bob
, so much...
"
241,"
MR. WOODWARD:
Yeah, yeah.
"
242,"
MS. NOONAN:
...for clarifying that.
"
243,"
MR. WOODWARD:
Yes.
"
244,"
MS. NOONAN:
I got to tell you, I'm one of those who thinks 
Palin
 will not run, and I happen to think if she runs, it will not work. Her people love her, 
support
 her, watch her on 
TV
, read her books, love to cheer her. They especially love to defend her when 
people like us
 criticize her. They will not vote...
"
245,"
MR. GREGORY:
But it almost, as a matter of fact, I mean, she...
"
246,"
MS. NOONAN:
I'm telling you, they will vote for her.
"
247,"
MR. GREGORY:
...she could run without running. She could be a factor without running.
"
248,"
MS. NOONAN:
They won't vote for her for president.
"
249,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah.
"
250,"
MS. NOONAN:
What I think she'll do is sit back. She's a realist, she'll know she's not going to -- this isn't going to work. And so she will sacrifice herself and 
support
 somebody else...
"
251,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
252,"
MS. NOONAN:
...so there'll be a 
Palin
 primary.
"
253,"
MR. GREGORY:
But to the -- all right, against whom, against whom is the president vulnerable, 
Doris
?
"
254,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Well, I think somebody like a 
Chris Christie
 would be vulnerable for him because...
"
255,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm. 
Governor of New Jersey
.
"
256,"
MS. GOODWIN:
...because he's got...
"
257,"
MR. GREGORY:
Who proclaimed on this 
program
 he's absolutely not running, no way.
"
258,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Right. So then he won't be vulnerable, and that's it.
"
259,"
MR. GREGORY:
But he won't rule it out four years ahead.
"
260,"
MS. NOONAN:
But that kind of man.
"
261,"
MS. GOODWIN:
No, but that -- that kind of -- that kind of 
person
.
"
262,"
MR. WOODWARD:
But, but he's the ultimate realist being made.
"
263,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
264,"
MS. NOONAN:
He is a practical man.
"
265,"
MS. GOODWIN:
The kind of 
person
 who speaks straight, who has a fire in his belly, who you believe him, even if you don't agree with him, that kind of 
person
, I think.
"
266,"
MR. WOODWARD:
Who seems not to be a politician.
"
267,"
MS. NOONAN:
Who seems to mean it.
"
268,"
MR. BROKAW:
I think the other thing is that all of this has to be in the context of what are the conditions going to be in nine months from now.
"
269,"
MS. GOODWIN:
Right, exactly. The 
economy
's doing...
"
270,"
MR. BROKAW:
Are we going to have another terrorist attack? Or if the 
country
 remains secure, do suddenly we catch fire in the 
economy
 in some fashion? For example, does something happen catastrophically in the 
Middle East
 that the president deals with either in utter failure or brilliantly. All those are the unknowns up against which we have to measure what the chances are, you know, and, and we still have a 
long way to go
 for that, 
David
.
"
271,"
MR. GREGORY:
Does the president make a fundamental shift, 
Tom
, in this next year, in his leadership style and in his tonal approach to the 
American people
 that gives him a lift?
"
272,"
MR. BROKAW:
He better. That's what I think.
"
273,"
MR. WOODWARD:
Well, I remember years ago talking to 
Obama
 when he was in the 
Senate
, and we were talking about 
Illinois
, and he went around the 
state
 saying, ""I have 
support
 here, I have 
support
 there, and I don't have 
support
 here."" 
And I
 walked away realizing, ""Oh, he's a politician. He knows where the votes are, and he's a realist."" The question is going to be, can he grow and adapt to whatever those circumstances are, and we don't know.
"
274,"
MR. BROKAW:
You know, the other thing is, here's what I think about, about 
President Obama
. We'll see whether this painful loss in November and then the recovery that we're seeing in the short term, in terms of his 
political
 fortunes, convert him, in some fashion, to a new kind of 
person
. I always said that 
Bill Clinton
's career was helped immeasurably by his defeat when he first ran for re-
election
 as governor of 
Arkansas
. He learned a lot from that. He had to deal with a lot of people in 
Arkansas
 that were in the 
business community
, and he also learned that he was vulnerable. By the time he got here, he'd been through that kind of an ordeal. 
Ronald Reagan
 had been governor of 
California
 for two terms before he got here. He'd been used to running a big 
state
 and dealing with 
Jess Unruh
 and the 
Democrats
. 
President Obama
 has not been through that kind of baptism by fire. And, and I hope now that he's beginning to listen to some of the business leaders who've been rapping on his door for the last year saying, ""We were for you. We have some things we think you ought to hear."" And whether or not he's going to be receptive to them now about how to 
change
 the 
economy
.
"
275,"
MR. GREGORY:
I'm going to make that the last word. We will leave it there. Thank you all very much. 
Happy new year
, and a 
happy new year
 to all of you at home. We'll be back next week. If it's Sunday, it's

281,PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  I want to thank the Democrats and Republicans who put conviction ahead of politics to get this done together.
282,(End videotape)
283,"MR. GREGORY:  But after the break, major challenges await the president in the new year:  high unemployment, the war in Afghanistan, a ballooning deficit, and Republican rule, at least in the House of Representatives. Where does the Obama team go from here?  With us this morning, senior adviser Valerie Jarrett."
284,Transcript & resource archive
285,"Then, taking stock of 2010."
286,(Videotape)
287,PRES. OBAMA:  It is the law of the land.
288,(End videotape)
289,"MR. GREGORY:  The passage of healthcare reform, the shock of an oil disaster in the gulf, the rise of the tea party, and the ongoing struggles of millions of Americans looking for work in a still fragile economy.  Where has it all left the country politically?  And will it be possible for the two parties to find any common ground in 2010?  With us, our political roundtable:  NBC News special correspondent Tom Brokaw; historian and author Doris Kearns Goodwin, columnist for The Wall Street Journal Peggy Noonan, and Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward."
290,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
291,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
292,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Before departing to Hawaii to join his family for the Christmas holiday, the president picked up several major legislative victories during this lame duck session of Congress:  the tax cut deal, the repeal of the ban on gays in the military, and the hard-fought
passage of the new START arms control treaty with Russia."
293,"(Videotape, December 22, 2010)"
294,"PRES. OBAMA:  A lot of folks in this town predicted that after the midterm elections, Washington would be headed for more partisanship and more gridlock. And, instead, this has been a season of progress for the American people."
295,(End videotape)
296,"MR. GREGORY:  And here to talk with us about the president's agenda heading into 2011, the top White House adviser and close friend of the president's Valerie Jarrett."
297,"Happy holidays, Valerie.  Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS."
298,"MS. VALERIE JARRETT:  Thank you, David, and same to you and your family, of course."
299,MR. GREGORY:  Thank you.
300,"""A season of progress,"" the president called it.  And it was just November 3 the president was talking about a shellacking that he was responsible for in the midterm election.  Then some unexpected victories in this lame duck session.  What happened in that interim time, from the
president's point of view?  Was there a course correction that he ushered in?"
301,"MS. JARRETT:  Well, I think as the president said right after the election, what we heard and what the nation said during the election is, is that they really wanted to see Congress and the president and the administration in Washington working together.  They wanted us to deliver
on behalf of the American people.  And I think what we saw over the course of the last few weeks is just that.  We made enormous progress, as you pointed out, from the taxes where, you know, everyone, when they get their next paycheck, instead of their taxes going up, they're going to go down with a payroll tax, with an earned income tax credit, with a child
care tax credit, with a credit so that we can afford to send children to college, and, and importantly, a credit so that companies will invest and they can take a hundred percent of their expenses now to create jobs for America.  So that sends a very positive signal."
302,"The START treaty, probably the president's single most important foreign policy accomplishment.  In fact, the, the most successful treaty in the--in decades was just passed as well.  And then you mentioned ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell."" Now we'll be able to have gays and lesbians serve their country proudly in the military.  And it's a military that's based on
trust, and so now they'll be able to serve proudly and represent our country.  These are all major accomplishments that were achieved on a bipartisan basis with Congress and the president, both sides of the aisle working together."
303,"MR. GREGORY:  You know, the vice president, who was on the program last week, responded to a question of mine about when people think about the president, do they--are they able to sort of pin him down?  You know, what is he exactly? A liberal, moderate, a centrist or what?  And he had, he had this response in part.  I want to play it for you."
304,"(Videotape, December 19, 2010)"
305,"VICE PRES. JOE BIDEN:  What he is, is he is a progressive leader who, in fact, understands that politics is all in the art of the, the possible. "
306,(End videotape)
307,"MR. GREGORY:  And that's--""the art of the possible,"" to a lot of observers, is a marked change from how he campaigned as somebody who was going to change Washington, change the way Washington operated.  Has he made a shift in his own mind to say, ""I've got to change tactics here, I've got to change strategy here in order to achieve some of the things that I want to achieve""?"
308,"MS. JARRETT:  No, I don't think so.  I think the president that we are seeing now is a--is the same person that I've known for over 20 years. When the president was in the state Senate, he had a reputation for being able to work very closely with people on the other side of the aisle and forge that compromise that's pragmatic.  He never lets the perfect be the enemy of the good, and I think that that's his reputation.  Early on in the administration I think the Republicans made a concerted decision to really oppose what we did.  And I think what we saw after the midterm is a president who said, ""I'm going to reach out more, I'm going to try
harder,"" and they reciprocated.  And that's, I think, what the people want."
309,"MR. GREGORY:  And is that really the issue here?  The tax deal sort of cleared out some of the underbrush here, and now there's more opportunity for real engagement, real agreement?"
310,"MS. JARRETT:  Well, I hope so.  I mean, I don't know about clearing out the underbrush.  I think it's an example of what we can do when everybody says, ""What's most important to me?"" And what the president said was most important to him was not to raise taxes on the middle class, was to make sure that those who were unemployed have 13 months of benefits.  Those are the ones who are going to go out, they're going to pay their rent, they're going to buy groceries, they're going to buy other household supplies, they're going to be able to afford Christmas presents for their children.  That's going to grow the economy and create jobs.  What was important to the Republicans was to have tax breaks for the very wealthy and the estate tax provisions.  And so when you marry the two, you ended up with a package that was able to get the bipartisan support that we needed."
311,"MR. GREGORY:  But the, the..."
312,"MS. JARRETT:  So in a sense, everybody got what they wanted."
313,"MR. GREGORY:  But this was a candidate who wrote in one of the memoirs that extending Bush tax cuts for the wealthy was morally troubling.  So a lot of the core supporters who came out in, in unprecedented numbers in 2008 see this as caving, or they see it as weakness.  They don't see it as somebody who is a progressive, who believes that politics is the art of the possible."
314,"MS. JARRETT:  Well, I guess what I would say is what the president wakes up every morning focusing on is what's best for the American people, what's not--not what's in his short-term political calculus, but what's really important to the American people.  And what he did not want to have happen on January 1 was to see our economy that, although it is improving, is still very fragile.  And he did not want to have people see their taxes go up, and he knew that's what was going to happen.  So he wasn't looking for a peer victory.  He wasn't going to just fight just to fight and take that chance. And so, what he realized is that he had to be
pragmatic, but he was being pragmatic in order to deliver for the American people.  And that's really what I think you have to focus your attention for, and that's what he views every decision he makes.  He has two priorities--and the vice president said this, again, last week on
your show--grow our economy, create jobs; and keep America safe."
315,MR. GREGORY:  But he...
316,MS. JARRETT:  And so every decision he makes is measured against that test.
317,"MR. GREGORY:  But still, as president, you do have to fight some things. He talked about it after the midterms.  You got to fight how things are done in Washington.  He told Jon Stewart recently that ""yes, we can"" is still ""yes, we can,"" but ""yes, we can, but."" I mean, is that now the story of the next year, that that Obama agenda has to be tempered by the realities of Washington?"
318,"MS. JARRETT:  Well, we do have to accept the realities that the Republicans did win the House.  And so they now have a responsibility to lead as well. And we can't ignore the realities of the membership and the makeup of Congress, and the fact that we are going to need bipartisan support to get things done.  That is a reality.  There are certain things the president won't compromise.  So, for example, the Republicans wanted the high income tax breaks to be permanent.  And what the president said is, ""No, we can't afford it.  In the new year, we're really going to have to tackle our deficit, and so we're not going to extend those tax breaks for the very wealthy indefinitely. We can't afford it, and it's going to be important that we control our deficit and, and we tighten our belts."" So that's something he is willing to fight for, and we'll see in the next year and the year after that he's going to fight very hard when those
two-year extensions expire to cut off the income break for the very wealthy."
319,"MR. GREGORY:  You, you are, among other parts of your portfolio, someone who is a liaison with the business community in America from the White House for this president.  The president's had a strained relationship with the business community, I don't have to tell you that.  He's acknowledged it.  He did so after the midterm election, talked about bankers as fat cats, and, and others that led business to really think that he was hostile toward them.  What does this tax package do to get people back to work, and what is the new area of cooperation between the White House and the business community to get the economy moving?"
320,"MS. JARRETT:  Well, let's put it in context and let's, let's keep in mind what was going on when the president took office.  Our financial institutions were crumbling, on the break of disaster.  Our economy was in a free fall. The stock market was crashing.  People were seeing their life savings destroyed.  Businesses were, were having to lay off people--in fact, the last six months of the prior administration we lost four million jobs.  It was a, it was a period of turmoil.  And the president had to take several bold and decisive steps, some of them
unpopular, to right our economy and get us on the right track."
321,"Just last week, the president had a group of about 20 CEOs from around the country come in and talk about how can we grow the economy?  How can we get some of the dollars that have been sitting on the balance sheet invested?  And it was a very good session where we spent four and a half hours really talking about what we have in common.  And I think what you're going to see going forward is an enormous amount of cooperation around exports, around free trade, making sure that the Korean Free Trade Agreement where the president lobbied very hard to open up export opportunities for U.S. companies gets passed through Congress; focusing on public education, making sure that our community colleges are training people in a way where there'll be real jobs at the end of the training. There's so many ways that businesses and, and the president are aligned right now.  And what he said to them is, ""Look, if you guys succeed, if you create jobs, if you invest in America, if we're able to help you
compete in a globally competitive marketplace, then the country wins."" And that's what the president wants."
322,"MR. GREGORY:  The president spoke after the midterms about a difficulty that he has had connecting with the American people, living in the bubble of the White House and being in the bubble of the presidency.  He talked about, as I said, after the midterm.  Let me play a portion of what he said."
323,"(Videotape, November 3, 2010)"
324,"PRES. OBAMA:  When you're in this place, it is hard not to seem removed, and one of the challenges that we've got to think about is, is, is how do I meet my responsibilities here in the White House, which require a lot of--lot of hours and a lot of work, but still, you know, have
that opportunity to engage with the American people on a, on a day-to-day basis and know--give, give them confidence that I'm listening to them. "
325,(End videotape)
326,MR. GREGORY:  You know him as well or better than anybody working in the White House.
327,MS. JARRETT:  Yes.
328,MR. GREGORY:  How does he do a better job of connecting with the American people when so many are hurting?
329,"MS. JARRETT:  Well, he often says that this is his biggest regret, is that when he took office, because of the crisis that was presented to him, he had to spend almost every waking hour in Washington focusing very hard on solving that crisis, and what he missed sorely was the engagement with the American people.  He said it right before he left for vacation. He said, ""When I get back, I really want to figure out a way where I can spend more time outside of Washington listening and learning and engaging with the American people."" It's really what gives him his energy and his strength, and so we're determined in the new year to make sure that his schedule reflects that priority."
330,"MR. GREGORY:  We are in midst of a permanent campaign, and the, the campaign of 2012 is already upon us.  And I found it interesting in one of the president's recent interviews, he said about a potential presidential aspirant, Sarah Palin, that he doesn't think about her.  Do you think he should?"
331,"MS. JARRETT:  Well, you know what I think?  As the president of the United States, his obligation is to think about all of Americans every day.  He has to wake up in the morning, he has to think about growing our economy, he has to think about keeping us safe.  He needs to keep focused on the on the prize, and I believe..."
332,MR. GREGORY:  But he also thinks about political opponents.
333,"MS. JARRETT:  Well, but you know what, I think as president his job is really to focus first on that.  And if he does that job well..."
334,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
335,"MS. JARRETT:  ...if he looks out for America, if it's clear that he's doing everything he can to make sure that hard-working Americans who've lost their jobs can go back to work, and if he keeps America safe and he demonstrates that, 24/7, that's his priority, then I think the politics
will take care of itself. "
336,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think he should be paying to attention to her as a political threat?
337,"MS. JARRETT:  I think he shouldn't be distracted by what are perceived as threats.  I mean, I think--I really go back to what I'm saying.  Because he's the president of the United States, he's not out there running the way he was before when he was the U.S. senator, where you have to think about everybody in the field every second of the day.  The American people expect him to lead. He's their president, he's everybody's president regardless of party affiliation.  And that doesn't mean that at some point he's not going to get out there and, and launch a campaign. But the most important thing that he can do for the American people is
think of them every single day and let them guide his actions."
338,"MR. GREGORY:  Finally, your role in the White House is unique.  I mean, for those of us who, who cover politics, who cover administrations, you have a lot of responsibility as an adviser, but you're also one of the president's closest friends and have helped to mentor him and develop him as a political figure.  What role do you play for him in that way?  What is unique about it, and how do you help strengthen him? "
339,"MS. JARRETT:  Well, I think the president's lucky to be surrounded by a strong group, both within the White House as well as his Cabinet of people, who he trusts and who he relies on for advice.  I think the fact that I'm a friend who's there, who's known him for a long time, provides me with the ability to be a sounding board in, in one way.  But I think that what's important to know about the president is he really listens to a variety of different voices, a diversity of opinion, and that's what really gives him the energy and the ability to think creatively and innovatively.  And when, when you see the president engage with a room full of people, he calls on not just the people he's known for 20 years, but the new stranger who's walked in the room who might be the junior person at the table, but who has a new idea for how we can grow our country and make it strong, how we can compete internationally."
340,"He has an almost insatiable appetite for new ideas from wherever he goes. When he's walking along a rope line, oftentimes people will lean in and whisper suggestions to him, and he comes back and he tells his economic team--some of the smartest people in the country--""This is what I heard today. What do you think about this idea?"" And I think that that's what you really want in a president, somebody who's innovative, who's creative, who's always looking for new ideas, and who surrounds himself with a divorce--diverse and robust group of people.  And, and I consider privileged to be at his service."
341,"MR. GREGORY:  We will leave it there.  Valerie Jarrett, thank you, as always."
342,MS. JARRETT:  You're welcome.
343,"MR. GREGORY:  Up next, taking stock of 2010.  Healthcare reform, the oil disaster in the gulf, the rise of the tea party and the ongoing economic crisis, where has it all left the country politically?  Our roundtable weighs in:  NBC's Tom Brokaw, historian and author Doris Kearns Goodwin, The Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan, and the Washington Post's Bob Woodward."
344,(Announcements)
345,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up, our roundtable examines where 2010 has left the country politically.  And will it be possible for the two parties to find any common ground in 2011?  After this brief commercial break. "
346,(Announcements)
347,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  And we are back, joined now by our special political roundtable:  historian and author Doris Kearns Goodwin; Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward; columnist for The Wall Street Journal, Peggy Noonan; and our own NBC News special correspondent, Tom Brokaw."
348,"Welcome to all of you, happy holidays.  There's so much to go through. "
349,"Tom Brokaw, you think about the lame duck session, how this year ends for President Obama, and all these people are talking about the ""comeback kid"" and ""look what he accomplished."" You know, on November 3 in the shellacking of the midterm it wasn't supposed to work out this way.  What happened?"
350,"MR. TOM BROKAW:  Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves here.  I mean, we've got a long way to go and there are a lot of big problems that are still out there.  But I do think that he's had a good month, obviously. I think that--and it's due in a large part to the fact that he seemed to
be in charge, that he was leading from the front and not from the back as the guy who was kind of consulting with everybody on the Hill before he made a decision.  He stepped up, and the country was ready for this kind of action, and the Republicans, I think, to some degree, got caught a little bit flat-footed by his eagerness to get the deal done in the way that he did and the way that he stood down the Democrats who weren't happy about it."
351,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let's pick up on that, Doris, because at the end of the week he signs a signature piece of legislation, and that is the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" which prohibited gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military.  This was a way to mitigate some of the damage on the left, to say, ""Look, this was a campaign promise.  I got this done.  You may not like that I'm dealing with the Republicans in other ways, but I got this done."" And on this issue, the, the politics were too difficult for the Republicans to stay united in opposition."
352,"MS. DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:  Right.  It's one of those moments when it was an idea whose time had come.  And the gay movement deserves a lot of credit for making the whole way we think about gays different now.  But it's very fortunate for Obama, I think, that that came at the same time as the tax cut, which a lot of the people on the left were upset about. But, you know, presidents in history are always upset about the people in their own party who criticize them.  And Teddy Roosevelt used to say, ""Oh, they're Tom Foolery guys.  They're lunatic fringe."" But on the other hand, they need them.  They need them to push in from the outside in so that what they can get done is larger than it might otherwise be.  So I
understand why he got irritated, but I think, on the other hand, it was great that he had that combination so he could say, ""Yeah, this is--I did this, but look, on the other hand, I did the tax cut."""
353,"MR. GREGORY:  Bob Woodward, what's your read on, on the president's strong finish?"
354,"MR. BOB WOODWARD:  I mean, it's, it's real, and the, the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" is a big deal.  That's a--that is a movement in civil rights..."
355,MS. GOODWIN:  Right.
356,"MR. WOODWARD:  ...that will be noted for a long time and perhaps forever. At the same time, there, there's something about Obama that is not connecting with the people.  And I was trying to think, you know, what is that?  And somebody was telling me about this wake and gathering that Richard Holbrooke's widow, Kati, had in New York after he died. Holbrooke being the Afghan/Pakistan negotiator for Obama who died.  And at this gathering, Bill Clinton walked in.  And, of course, Clinton always takes over a room, and he put his arm around Kati, the widow, and started talking and saying that Richard Holbrooke had been somebody who always fought, who believed in peace. And somebody who was there told me, he said suddenly everyone in the room was involved in Bill Clinton's emotions.  And that's what Obama has to do.  He has to find a way to make these things personal, not abstract.  He's so cerebral, he's so smart, he appears cool.  And he's got to get in there and make those connections with, with the people in the unemployment line, the assembly line, in the mountains of Afghanistan."
357,"MS. GOODWIN:  You know, I agree with you.  But the very steadiness that allowed him to come back from Scott Brown's victory, which seemed like he was dead in January, and then he brought health care..."
358,"MR. GREGORY:  Who succeeded Ted Kennedy, of course."
359,"MS. GOODWIN:  Exactly.  And now allowed him to come back from the shellacking in the midterm, that's a strength to neither be too high or too low, and to keep that steadiness.  I'm sure at times you want him to yell, you want him to fight, you want him to show more emotion, but maybe those qualities don't often come together in the same person."
360,"MR. WOODWARD:  But as, as a manager, he did a great job.  It's masterful. But as something connecting with the average voter, he's not yet there, and that's how you win."
361,MR. GREGORY:  Peggy...
362,"MS. PEGGY NOONAN:  Can I throw in, too?"
363,MR. WOODWARD:  Yeah.
364,"MS. NOONAN:  I got--on an issue like--considering the president's position right now, an issue like ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" is perfect. Here's why. It's a liberal issue, it's a left issue, fine.  But it was in line with centrist thinking.  The center supported the change.  When a president of the left can make leftist moves with centrist support, he's going to be OK. Rightist president, the same thing.  So always keep in, in mind the center.  I would say also, Bob, as, as an extenuation to your remarks, I think the president has to regain his mystique, you know.  The
presidency has a mystique, it has certain weight.  It has a, a certain gravitational pull.  I think the president walked into the White House with a certain mystique.  I think he lost it in his first two years.  He needs to gain it back.  That's my read."
365,"MR. GREGORY:  Tom, I want to pull out a little bit farther, but before I do, I want to follow up on something specific about ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell."" There's still a lot of questions about how this gets implemented, and then there's another question about military recruiting on college
campuses.  My own wife, as you know, was part of the ROTC program at Princeton, as a lot of Americans were who were in the military and are no longer in the military.  Is that the next step here, to take that on? "
366,"MR. BROKAW:  Well, take it on is quite another question.  The military has mixed feelings about whether they want to go back to Harvard, go back to Columbia, go back to the Ivy League schools.  It's expensive."
367,MR. GREGORY:  Hm.
368,"MR. BROKAW:  ROTC programs, and it's whether they get a big enough bang for their buck.  Do they get enough kids who sign up for it at the elite institutions to go into a commissioned program of some kind?  Or are they better off working at the land grant schools where they're going to get generally a greater response to it.  So that's an issue.  Now, the Ivy League and elite institutions are beginning to say, ""We would welcome them back, we want to open that conversation again,"" because of the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell."" But you may find the military saying, you know, ""I'm not sure that we need to go there because, frankly, it's
just not a happy hunting ground for us.  We're not going to get that many people."""
369,"MR. WOODWARD:  No, but it's important.  I did naval ROTC in college back..."
370,MR. BROKAW:  Yeah.
371,"MR. WOODWARD:  ...in, you know, the Coolidge administration or whenever it was."
372,MR. BROKAW:  Right.
373,MR. WOODWARD:  And it is...
374,MR. BROKAW:  Not Wilson.
375,MR. WOODWARD:  It is important for the military to connect there with exactly the point you made recently...
376,MR. BROKAW:  Right.
377,MR. WOODWARD:  ...in your op/ed piece...
378,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
379,"MR. WOODWARD:  ...about this disconnect between those who serve and people who kind of say, ""Oh, no, not that, that's not for me."" And one way to do that is to, to bring it, bring it--bring ROTC everywhere. "
380,"MR. BROKAW:  Well, here's what I think, Bob.  I've actually been thinking about this a fair amount, and I--what I would do is, if not do it campus by campus, if you go to Boston, for example, you could do an MIT/Harvard program and put a couple of the institutions together and have a central ROTC program drawing on all the institutions.  If you do it by institution by institution, with the questions that the military already has about a lot of costs--you got to put officers in those programs and training programs--they may be better to do something that is more centralized."
381,"MR. GREGORY:  Let, let me, let me bring it back to some of the wider challenges that the president has faced this year.  We can look at what's happened in the last couple of weeks, he had a strong finish, but this has been a tough year for the president, for Democrats.  AP wrote about it, in summing it up, and started with the passage of healthcare reform. Quoting the president, ""`This is what change looks like,' Obama said proudly, after the health care law passed."
382,"""But the economic recovery was too slow.  The oil gushed for too long. The health care laws was too complicated.  The unemployment rate too high.  The political discourse too raw.  The tea party too loud. Americans were in a foul mood, and Democrats got the blame."" That's
really the story of 2010."
383,"MS. NOONAN:  Well, it's not--the way that's written, it suggests it was a matter of fate.  Oh, my goodness, decisions were made, they were not popular. You know, health care, two years into this drama, you can look at it, look at the numbers, and you realize people just don't love that. That, that was just the wrong..."
384,MR. BROKAW:  They don't understand it.
385,"MS. GOODWIN:  They don't understand it, yeah."
386,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
387,"MS. NOONAN:  Well, when you're two years in and they still, everywhere across the country, are scratching their heads, that is almost the definition of a bad idea."
388,MR. BROKAW:  Right.
389,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Tom, do they not understand it, or do they understand too well..."
390,MS. NOONAN:  And the president gave his first 18 months to it.
391,MR. GREGORY:  ...that in fact it's going to help poor people in a tight economy?
392,"MR. BROKAW:  Well, there are two different answers to that, David.  I think that a lot of small businesses understand it very well, and they say, ""It's going to cost us more money, and we're going to move our employees into the Medicaid program or something else for their--we're not going to be able to afford to cover them."" People who are looking at it from the ground up are saying, ""I don't get it."" And it's 2,700 pages. Most of the major health institutions that I know in this country who are going to be responsible for the care are still trying to sort their
way through it.  At the very highest levels, they don't quite understand how it's going to work."
393,"MS. GOODWIN:  You know, I think one of the..."
394,"MS. NOONAN:  Just politically, it was a misjudgment."
395,MR. BROKAW:  Right.
396,"MS. GOODWIN:  Well, I'm not sure it was a misjudgment, but I think..."
397,MS. NOONAN:  Just a waste of time and reputation.
398,"MS. GOODWIN:  You mean to even do it, you think it was?  I, I don't agree with that."
399,MS. NOONAN:  To go down that road with that bill.
400,"MS. GOODWIN:  But I think that what hasn't been done, you know, Bill Safire always used to say, when he gave a speech, tell them what you're going to say, then tell them--and then tell them what you told them. Somehow we never got straight what that, that healthcare bill was.  A lot of people didn't understand what was in it, and that's a failure of the bully pulpit.  Part of that is the rhetoric of the president.  Part of it, it's really hard to get anything out to the country today because everything is so distracting."
401,MR. WOODWARD:  I...
402,"MS. GOODWIN:  You give a speech on health care and the guy says, Joe Wilson says, ""You lie,"" and that becomes the story."
403,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
404,"MR. WOODWARD:  No, no, but I actually met somebody who read it, the whole thing, read it twice, and he, he confessed he didn't understand it. "
405,"MS. GOODWIN:  Oh, that's a problem."
406,MR. WOODWARD:  The complexity and...
407,MS. NOONAN:  Yeah.
408,"MR. WOODWARD:  Now, one of the..."
409,MS. NOONAN:  The...(unintelligible)...a lot of it was just slapped in there. Nobody knows what's it all--interpretive.
410,"MR. WOODWARD:  I don't think the health care and, and where that's going or, you know, how it gets changed or implemented is a peril to the Obama presidency.  I think there are other things, like the threat of terrorism, very, very real.  And..."
411,"MR. BROKAW:  And it's systemic unemployment, Bob.  That's the--they missed the pass on that."
412,MR. WOODWARD:  Yes.  That's...
413,"MR. BROKAW:  Systemic unemployment.  When they--when it goes up 2 point--when it goes up two-tenths of a point right before the election after they thought that they were on the right direction, that is a big signal.  And my own guess is that it's probably a 12 or 13 percent of those people who are not looking for jobs anymore."
414,MS. GOODWIN:  Right.
415,"MR. GREGORY:  But on Peggy's point, I think, whether it's about health care, the government stepped up, took some big whacks at policy, namely dealing with the economy, and a lot of people said, ""Well, wait a minute, nothing's worked here.  You know, you bailed out the banks--started under Bush, you continued it--the auto companies, you did health care, you did
the stimulus, and we're still in the same position.  I still don't have any equity in my house anymore, and I can't find a job."" That's a role of government issue."
416,"MS. NOONAN:  There's also this, this--growing from that, but part of what we're talking about is this--the biggest political change in the United States in my lifetime is the sense grown-ups have that their children will not have it better.  It is a--we are a happy people.  You can walk
along any street in America right now..."
417,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
418,"MS. NOONAN:  ...and you can see people just doing Christmas and the holidays, and it's wonderful.  But there is deep down, on the third level of thought, a, a strain of pessimism that I've never seen before."
419,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, and, Peggy, look at this from our recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, people's views on the last--on this last decade, that it's the worst decade in history at 54 percentile."
420,MS. NOONAN:  Ah.
421,MR. BROKAW:  Yeah.
422,"MS. NOONAN:  Well, part of that is big things happened at the beginning."
423,MR. BROKAW:  But part of that because they're living through it.
424,MS. NOONAN:  Well...
425,"MR. BROKAW:  Well, let me take them back to 1938, for example..."
426,"MS. NOONAN:  Yeah, exactly."
427,"MR. BROKAW:  ...when the prospect of war and World War II, and the, and the recovery wasn't working as well as FDR had hoped it would in that year, and we still had bread lines in America, and the country was on its backside at that point."
428,MS. NOONAN:  And we were hopeful.
429,"MR. BROKAW:  And, and how about the, how about the..."
430,MS. NOONAN:  Do you--it was dreadful.
431,"MR. BROKAW:  ...worst decade leading up to the Civil War, you know?"
432,MS. GOODWIN:  Yeah.  And for those of us who are historians and who've lived in those other decades...
433,MR. BROKAW:  Right.
434,"MS. GOODWIN:  ...the 1860s, the 1930s, I'll still take this one, as troubling as it is."
435,"MR. GREGORY:  What about course correction, though?  Because, Bob, you talked about connecting, and this issue of how the president positions himself to deal with the pessimism, to deal with systemic unemployment, the threat of terror.  Politico wrote something interesting about ""Obama 2.0:  Reinventing the Presidency,"" and wrote--they wrote this:  ""`He needs to be CEO of America,' said former White House chief of staff John Podesta, an Obama sympathizer who ran his transition to power after the '08 election and is now urging him to dramatically refashion his presidency."
436,"""The West Wing makeover, as Podesta and others see it, would involve Obama no longer being Velcroed to the Hill' and giving more attention to powers of the presidency that don't involve signing bills into the law."" In other words, legislating is not good for popularity."
437,"MR. WOODWARD:  That's true.  But if you've--you talk to economists, CEOs, the one theme that comes through all of this in terms of the economy, you need a plan."
438,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
439,"MR. WOODWARD:  And you need a plan that's not one year or two years, you need a long range plan.  And no politician in the modern era has figured out to present a 10-year plan that he or she could sell politically. "
440,MR. GREGORY:  Hm.
441,"MR. WOODWARD:  And--because the problems in the economy are, are structural. They--it's not something you can tinker with, it's something that--you get a CEO on Sodium Pentathol here, truth serum, and say, you know, ""How do you fix these things?"" And they'll say, ""Well, what's your 10-year plan, your eight-year plan?"" And so he's got to find a way to make that politically salable.  Whether he can, we'll see."
442,"MS. GOODWIN:  I think there's a way of having a bold vision.  I mean, think about what FDR did in 1940.  We were still coming out of the depression, we had the war in Europe to worry about, but he mobilized the economy in a fantastic way.  He brought in CEOs to run his production agencies.  I think Obama could do something similar like that.  He, he gave much bigger appreciation, deceleration tax credits to business, and they came through to produce the ships, the tanks, and the weapons. Right now, if he were to go for alternative energy in a bigger way than he has, if he would get these CEOs and say, ""What kind of tax credits do you need to keep jobs here in this country?"" there's a way of making America competitive in the world again, be number one economically. "
443,"MR. WOODWARD:  But he had that war, and that was, you know, that was the engine that drove it economically."
444,"MS. GOODWIN:  Of course, it's easier--but you can make things.  You can't believe that that's all it has to be.  I mean, you got to believe that, you know?"
445,MR. WOODWARD:  Maybe that's the answer.
446,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, let me get a break in here.  We'll come back and talk specifically about some of the challenges ahead:  spending, the war in Afghanistan, and the political landscape which is already taking shape for 2012.  More from our roundtable right after this."
447,(Announcements)
448,"MR. GREGORY:  We are back, joined again by our political roundtable.  And I want to talk about some of the specific challenges the president faces. There are some tough issues out there.  I think the first one is best summed up by Merriam and the word of the year for 2010, we'll put it up on the screen.  It is austerity.  It is a noun, ""enforced or extreme economy."" Tom Brokaw, that's what Washington is, is going to be grappling with, which is government's got to shrink, it's got to spend less.  It's how to go about doing it."
449,"MR. BROKAW:  Yeah.  Well, you know, in fact, if you go across the country, you find a lot of families who are already doing that.  More, more women are saying to me, ""I buy an extra edition of the Sunday paper just to get the coupons.  And I'm going--I used to make fun of people in the grocery stores with coupons; I'm now clipping them myself."""
450,"On the other hand, when they make a decision to close a military base in whatever state, a Republican or a Democratic state, or when they're going to shut down an agricultural substation, you're always going to get the pushback from the special interest.  The community's going to say, ""They can't do that. I mean, that's our whole economy."" So this is going to be a very tricky piece. Mitch McConnell said the other day, the president's in for a big fight here. But the Republicans have got a lot of pressure on them as well because they made some big promises about how much they can cut spending.  And we're not going to kick-start the economy just by cutting spending and by cutting taxes. There are, as I said a moment ago, some real structural issues that we have to deal with here.  Innovation is way behind the curve about what's be--about what's going on in Vietnam  and India and China, and even in the Middle East, for that matter.  And we're not addressing that by this political rhetoric."
451,MS. NOONAN:  I think you
452,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, and that is--I've asked this question, Peggy, to numerous guests over the past several weeks:  Do we have the balance right between austerity and what Tom mentioned, innovation? "
453,MR. BROKAW:  Yeah.
454,MR. GREGORY:  Are we done investing in our economy to ultimately be competitive before we can deal with this long-term debt picture?
455,"MS. NOONAN:  Well, that's a huge one.  I mean, that's going to be worked out over, over the next few years.  I'm thinking as, as Tom was speaking, we have 40 million Americans on food stamps."
456,MR. BROKAW:  Yeah.
457,"MS. NOONAN:  We have a lot of people in distress and a lot of people getting help from the government.  It is true that we have to cut spending.  I mean, everybody can make that speech.  But it's going to be really difficult at the same time entrenched interests that are winding up costing a heck of a lot of money in America, such as, as municipal and state employee unions with pension benefits, etc.  Every state is going bankrupt.  They all have to look at the price of things.  I don't know if austerity is really the right word."
458,MS. GOODWIN:  I think--it's an odd word. 
459,MS. NOONAN:  This is the--yeah.  This is some grinding of levers.
460,"MS. GOODWIN:  It is.  And I think it--in a certain sense, there's a difference--austerity means sort of self-discipline.  Shared sacrifice means you're doing something for a higher object.  Like for example, during World War II, they, they called what we were wearing ""austerity clothing."" It meant trousers that didn't have cuffs anymore.  No vests, it meant two-piece bathing suits to save cloth, so you didn't have a one-piece bathing suit.  But you knew you were doing it..."
461,MR. WOODWARD:  That's where those came from.
462,"MS. GOODWIN:  Yeah!  It was a good--but you knew you were doing it for a common cause, and I think leadership strength has to be right now, if we're going to go through an austere period, to convince us that something more than just undoing the deficit, that we're investing in the future at the same time as we're being austere."
463,"MR. WOODWARD:  But, but..."
464,MS. NOONAN:  Which involves trust.  Leaders you trust.
465,MS. GOODWIN:  That's exactly right.
466,"MS. NOONAN:  Who, when they say, ""Everybody's going to take a haircut, everybody's going to get--have some difficulties but we can all get through it together, we're a great nation,"" that's the difficult part. "
467,"MR. WOODWARD:  But, but there's all this talk about cutting spending, and then they don't do it.  Of course, the tax cut deal, what, is going to add 800..."
468,MR. GREGORY:  A trillion dollars.
469,"MR. WOODWARD:  ...almost $1 trillion to the deficit, and if you go back--I happened to recently be reading Ronald Reagan's own autobiography, and in there he says--and he's identified with somebody who tried to cut government--and in it he in a very confessional way
says, ""One of my biggest disappointments as president, I was not able to do this in""--he says, ""I've let down the people on this issue."" So if Ronald Reagan couldn't cut spending who's going to do it now?"
470,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but..."
471,"MS. NOONAN:  He was able to cut the increase, the yearly increase, but he was never able to cut into this huge thing."
472,MR. WOODWARD:  That's right.
473,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Tom, what--you guys--there are cross-currents in the Republican Party over just how deeply they want to cut which programs. Are they going to really go after entitlements?  Are they going to repeal health care?  How does the president navigate this?  Because the budget is the big fight of 2011."
474,"MR. BROKAW:  Well, I think part of what he does is take a listen from Bill Clinton.  Let them play their own hand for a while and stand back from it and see what happens within their party.  Look, there's going to be more pressure coming from the ground up in the Republican Party than we can now fully anticipate in these tea party members who are coming in. And when they come to increase the debt limit in June or down, down the pike a little ways or shut down the government, the tea party people who have come in on this wave of populism within the Republican Party are going to push back very hard. Peggy was close witness to this, but I was reading as well some of the Reagan years, and people forget this, in 1982 he raised taxes after cutting them the year before.  But they had wonderful language.  They called the tax cut not a tax--I mean, a tax increase, not a tax increase, they called it revenue enhancement."
475,MS. GOODWIN:  Right.
476,"MS. NOONAN:  Ah, those were the days.  Those were the good old days."
477,"MR. BROKAW:  And President Reagan also said, and only Reagan could have gotten away with this, he said--when he signed the bill and addressed the country about what he was doing, he said, ""This is really an extension of what we did a year ago when they cut taxes."" To increase taxes was an extension of that, and somehow they were able to market that."
478,"MR. WOODWARD:  Well, and..."
479,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but--go ahead."
480,"MR. WOODWARD:  ...and we're going to have to raise taxes at some point here, or you don't address the deficit problem.  And again, if you go to Reagan, the deal he made with Tip O'Neill, they doubled the payroll tax..."
481,MS. GOODWIN:  Right.
482,MR. BROKAW:  Right.
483,MR. WOODWARD:  ...which is the most regressive tax in our system.
484,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Peggy, how do--how do Republicans manage here?  John Boehner is the speaker of the House.  He's a familiar figure in the Republican reins.  Mitch McConnell, on the Senate side, he boasted about making the Democrats sweat tactically as we get into the new year. What's this dynamic going to be like?"
485,"MS. NOONAN:  Well, it's interesting.  They've been--the Republican Party has been winning big consequential serious elections throughout '09 and '10.  They just won the House, 66 seats, so it is very significant.  But they all know the problem is entitlement spending, and if you are going to look at where the money is spent, you're going to have to decide how exactly do we go at this and how do we go at it, not only among the available remedies on spending, how do we take any one of those remedies without the presidency?  Do you know what I mean?  It'll be highly unusual for a party that is not holding the presidency, that is only holding the House, to make huge change here, and yet they have to move forward in a serious way or the people who elected them will be very angry with them."
486,"MR. GREGORY:  Bob Woodward, another huge challenge is the war in Afghanistan. 2011 is the year when troops, American troops will start to come out, the president tells us.  The vice president was on the program last week.  I pressed him on this deadline point.  And this is what he said about the endgame."
487,"(Videotape, last Sunday)"
488,"VICE PRES. JOE BIDEN:  The recent Lisbon conference, the NATO conference, where we said we're starting this process just like we did in Iraq. We're starting it in July of 2011, and we're going to be totally out of there come hell or high water by 2014."
489,(End videotape)
490,"MR. GREGORY:  2014.  Now The Wall Street Journal took this on in an editorial saying that this was a mistake.  And this is what they wrote in part:  ""Mr. Biden's glib rhetoric implying a lack of American staying power will in particular make it that much harder for General Petraeus to
get the support of Pakistan's military in rooting out Taliban sanctuaries in North Waziristan and around Quetta."" This is over the border from Afghanistan and the tribal areas. ""The remarks also undermine months of Administration effort to downplay its original mistake of setting a July
2011 deadline for beginning to withdraw U.S. forces.  The U.S. and its allies went out of their way at the recent NATO summit in Lisbon to extend to 2014 the date when Afghan forces will take, `full responsibility for security' in their country.  But even full responsibility does not mean the Afghans won't need some foreign military help."""
491,"MR. WOODWARD:  Does your head spin?  Yes, it does because--what they've told us is the beginning of the end of the war is July of next year and the end of the war is 2014.  What they haven't told us is how they're going to do it. And how it will work.  And there still is this disconnect between Obama and his White House and the military about where this is going.  And, you know, if you take that report that they issued after studying this, you know, really for months, they said, ""Well, it--we've made progress, but it's fragile and reversible."" Now, if you've got ratings in, you know, and you're making progress but it's fragile and reversible--you're smiling..."
492,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
493,"MR. WOODWARD:  ...you know, what does that mean?"
494,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
495,MR. WOODWARD:  That means you're in Never Never Land.  That means we don't know.
496,"MR. GREGORY:  But can the president, Doris, make the case that we are still fighting an existential threat in Afghanistan?  Does he have to do that in order to maintain some modicum of support?"
497,"MS. GOODWIN:  Well, I think one of the things that hasn't happened yet, because he obviously hasn't made that case strong enough, six out of 10 people don't think this is a war worth fighting.  In a democracy, you cannot bring soldiers into harm's way unless you've convinced the people that this is a war that we should be fighting.  And the threat of al-Qaeda still remains the strongest question.  If we can prevent and dismantle and disable them from getting back at us, then that's worth doing.  But somehow that hasn't penetrated the country, and that's a failure of leadership until that happens."
498,"MS. NOONAN:  It is amazing to me that we are, what, nine years into, into these wars..."
499,MR. BROKAW:  Longest war in American history.
500,"MS. NOONAN:  Oh my goodness, and we are not talking about it every day..."
501,MS. GOODWIN:  Right.
502,MS. NOONAN:  ...on the streets and in the cafe and over coffee.
503,MS. GOODWIN:  It's terrible.
504,"MS. NOONAN:  It is amazing.  It's just accepted as a fact that one
doesn't comment on."
505,"MR. BROKAW:  That's because less than one percent of the country is fighting the war.  I mean, and 99 percent of the country nothing is asked of us.  I mean..."
506,MS. GOODWIN:  Right.
507,"MS. NOONAN:  Well, then we better get our ROTC back to Harvard."
508,MS. GOODWIN:  Right.
509,"MR. BROKAW:  And--well, I don't think that will make the difference, in all due respect, because they have a choice of whether or not they want to join ROTC.  They don't have to.  It's not mandatory. "
510,MS. NOONAN:  Sure.  Of course.
511,MR. BROKAW:  And so it's working class--Bob and I have talked about this a lot--working class families primarily come from the smaller towns in America.
512,MS. NOONAN:  It always is that.
513,"MR. BROKAW:  They come from a military tradition of joining.  But it's an obligation of all of us as well as the political leadership of this country to make sure that it's on the table, not just in forums like this, but on a, on a regular basis.  I also think that we're looking at this in old terms.  We're looking at, where's the victory in Afghanistan? Afghanistan has had 2,000 years of foreign invaders who have crawled out of there without a victory in conventional terms.  And it goes beyond the borders of Afghanistan.  We're talking about Islamic rage.  I've been in
Waziristan and in the north in the Khyber region.  These are two of the most hostile areas I have ever seen anywhere in the world.  And as some of you know, I've been in a lot of bad places."
514,"MR. WOODWARD:  And the problem hasn't been defined with specificity that's necessary.  The problem is, in these secret meetings last year, Obama said the poison is in Pakistan.  The problem is in Pakistan.  The sanctuaries are there and he decided secretly, ""OK, these sanctuaries are unacceptable now."""
515,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me get another break in here.  We'll have just a couple of minutes left on the other side of this break, and we'll at least broach the topic that's already under way, which is, who are the Republicans going to nominate to challenge President Obama?  Some final
thoughts from our roundtable right after this."
516,(Announcements)
517,"MR. GREGORY:  We are back with more from our roundtable, final moments."
518,"Tom Brokaw, you know, at this stage of the 2008 cycle, we were getting ready for the new year and some new announcements as to who was going to run for president."
519,MR. BROKAW:  Right.
520,MR. GREGORY:  So what are Republicans going to do?
521,"MR. BROKAW:  Well, I--you know, who knows at this point, David.  You've heard me say this a thousand times over, the UFO theory always holds, the unforeseen will occur.  We don't know who they are at this point.  It was just 15 months ago that the tea party was just a faint line on the political horizon in this country, and then suddenly it was this very powerful force.  There are obviously a lot of Republicans in the Senate and in the statehouses around the country who see themselves in the Oval Office.  I mean, Tim Pawlenty is running hard in Minnesota, Sarah Palin, obviously, is more than flirting with the idea.  Now, Haley Barbour probably has banged himself up again a little bit in the last week or so with his comments about the White Citizens Council, to say nothing of people in the United States Senate, and Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts.  So there's a lot of moving around going on out there."
522,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, what kind of candidate, Peggy Noonan, do you need to run as the Republican Party, to take on Obama?  What's the theory of the case at this stage?"
523,"MS. NOONAN:  Hm.  A big thing is how the tectonic plates keep moving in American politics.  Harrison Salisbury once said--a lifetime in journalism, he was asked, ""What did you learn?"" He said, ""Expect the unexpected."" If we've learned anything from the past decade, it's that anybody can arise from anywhere and become a leader."
524,MR. WOODWARD:  Mm-hmm.
525,"MS. NOONAN:  Gosh, what do the, the Republicans need to beat Obama?  A credible alternative, a serious man or woman, someone with experience and some weight and heft who can get through Iowa and South Carolina."
526,"MR. WOODWARD:  And so, not Sarah Palin, you're saying, is that right?"
527,"MS. NOONAN:  Thank you, Bob, so much..."
528,"MR. WOODWARD:  Yeah, yeah."
529,MS. NOONAN:  ...for clarifying that.
530,MR. WOODWARD:  Yes.
531,"MS. NOONAN:  I got to tell you, I'm one of those who thinks Palin will not run, and I happen to think if she runs, it will not work.  Her people love her, support her, watch her on TV, read her books, love to cheer her.  They especially love to defend her when people like us criticize
her.  They will not vote..."
532,"MR. GREGORY:  But it almost, as a matter of fact, I mean, she..."
533,"MS. NOONAN:  I'm telling you, they will vote for her."
534,MR. GREGORY:  ...she could run without running.  She could be a factor without running.
535,MS. NOONAN:  They won't vote for her for president.
536,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
537,"MS. NOONAN:  What I think she'll do is sit back.  She's a realist, she'll know she's not going to--this isn't going to work.  And so she will sacrifice herself and support somebody else..."
538,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
539,MS. NOONAN:  ...so there'll be a Palin primary.
540,"MR. GREGORY:  But to the--all right, against whom, against whom is the president vulnerable, Doris?"
541,"MS. GOODWIN:  Well, I think somebody like a Chris Christie would be vulnerable for him because..."
542,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.  Governor of New Jersey.
543,MS. GOODWIN:  ...because he's got...
544,"MR. GREGORY:  Who proclaimed on this program he's absolutely not running, no way."
545,"MS. GOODWIN:  Right.  So then he won't be vulnerable, and that's it."
546,MR. GREGORY:  But he won't rule it out four years ahead.
547,MS. NOONAN:  But that kind of man.
548,"MS. GOODWIN:  No, but that--that kind of--that kind of person."
549,"MR. WOODWARD:  But, but he's the ultimate realist being made."
550,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
551,MS. NOONAN:  He is a practical man.
552,"MS. GOODWIN:  The kind of person who speaks straight, who has a fire in his belly, who you believe him, even if you don't agree with him, that kind of person, I think."
553,MR. WOODWARD:  Who seems to not be a politician.
554,MS. NOONAN:  Who seems to mean it.
555,MR. BROKAW:  I think the other thing is that all of this has to be in the context of what are the conditions going to be in nine months from now. 
556,"MS. GOODWIN:  Right, exactly.  The economy's doing..."
557,"MR. BROKAW:  Are we going to have another terrorist attack?  Or if the country remains secure, do suddenly we catch fire in the economy in some fashion?  For example, does something happen catastrophically in the Middle East that the president deals with either in utter failure or brilliantly. All those are the unknowns up against which we have to measure what the chances are, you know, and, and we still have a long way to go for that, David."
558,"MR. GREGORY:  Does the president make a fundamental shift, Tom, in this next year, in his leadership style and in his tonal approach to the American people that gives him a lift?"
559,MR. BROKAW:  He better.  That's what I think.
560,"MR. WOODWARD:  Well, I remember years ago talking to Obama when he was in the Senate, and we were talking about Illinois, and he went around the state saying, ""I have support here, I have support there, and I don't have support here."" And I walked away realizing, ""Oh, he's a politician. He knows where the votes are, and he's a realist."" The question is going to be, can he grow and adapt to whatever those circumstances are, and we don't know."
561,"MR. BROKAW:  You know, the other thing is, here's what I think about, about President Obama.  We'll see whether this painful loss in November and then the recovery that we're seeing in the short term, in terms of his political fortunes, convert him, in some fashion, to a new kind of person.  I always said that Bill Clinton's career was helped immeasurably by his defeat when he first ran for re-election as governor of Arkansas. He learned a lot from that.  He had to deal with a lot of people in Arkansas that were in the business community, and he also learned that he was vulnerable.  By the time he got here, he'd been through that kind of
an ordeal.  Ronald Reagan had been governor of California for two terms before he got here.  He'd been used to running a big state and dealing with Jess Unruh and the Democrats.  President Obama has not been through that kind of baptism by fire.  And, and I hope now that he's beginning to listen to some of the business leaders who've been rapping on his door for the last year saying, ""We were for you.  We have some things we think you ought to hear."" And whether or not he's going to be receptive to them now about how to change the economy."
562,"MR. GREGORY:  I'm going to make that the last word.  We will leave it there. Thank you all very much.  Happy new year, and a happy new year to all of you at home."
563,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We'll be back next week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday:  Two major threats facing the U.S., terrorism and recession.  The country's top intelligence officials warn that al-Qaeda will attempt another attack against America within months as the administration is under fire for its handling of terror suspects, making national security a top campaign issue this year.  Our guest this morning, the president's top counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan.
    "
1,"Then, the economy.  A puzzling jobs report features a dip in the unemployment rate below 10 percent.  But where are the jobs?  And are deficits as far as the eye can see undermining America's power and influence in the world?  Our exclusive guests this morning discuss the present and the future of the U.S. economy:  former Treasury secretary and author of the new book ""On the Brink"" Henry Paulson, and former chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan.
Finally, your politics fix.  Sarah Palin rallies the tea party Saturday night."
2,(Videotape)
3,"FMR. GOV. SARAH PALIN (R-AK):  We need a commander in chief, not a professor of law standing at the lectern."
4,(End videotape)
5,"MR. GREGORY:  Scott Brown is sworn in as the 41st GOP senator.  What now for the Obama agenda?  A jobs bill, financial regulation and health care.  With us, two former White House insiders, counselor to President George W.  Bush Ed Gillespie, and press secretary to President Bill Clinton, Dee Dee Myers."
6,"But first, you can call it the winter of Washington, D.C.'s discontent.  The city at a virtual standstill this weekend, socked with the worst winter storm to hit the area in 90 years.  When all was said and done, nearly 20 inches of snow in the district, more than 30 inches in the outlying areas.  President Obama braved the blizzard, heading just a few blocks north of the White House to address the Democratic National Committee meeting."
7,"(Videotape, February 6, 2010)"
8,PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  Snowmageddon here in D.C.
9,(End videotape)
10,"MR. GREGORY:  Others are calling it the snow, snow, ""snowpocalypse"" or ""snow MG."" D.C. is now digging out from this massive storm, hoping to get back to normal and back to work on health care, a jobs bill, and the difficult task of battling terrorism, which is where we will begin our conversation this morning.  And here now, the president's top counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan."
11,"Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS, and thank you for braving the elements here to get here this morning."
12,"MR. JOHN BRENNAN:  Thank you, David."
13,"MR. GREGORY:  Very serious topic to discuss this morning in terms of the al-Qaeda threat.  The president was at the CIA, marking those who have fallen recently with the agency, and he spoke of the war about the war in Afghanistan to hundreds of employees, urging them to complete the mission and win the war. How does he define winning?"
14,"MR. BRENNAN:  The, the visit out to CIA headquarters was a poignant and somber reminder of exactly how determined the intelligence community, this U.S. government is to destroy al-Qaeda.  And as we move forward in Afghanistan and Pakistan and other areas, we are determined to destroy al-Qaeda the organization.  They have used areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan to ply their trade, to train their operatives, and we are moving forward in cooperation with the Afghan and Pakistan government to take away that safe haven, to take away their ability to train those operatives, to carry out attacks either there or here in the homeland."
15,"MR. GREGORY:  We're up against a very difficult threat, as was underlined during testimony in front of the Intelligence Committee this week.  This is a portion of that question.
(Videotape, February 2, 2010)"
16,"SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA):  What is the likelihood of another terrorist attempted attack on the U.S. homeland in the next three to six months, high or low?  Director Blair:"
17,"MR. DENNIS BLAIR:  An attempted attack, the priority is certain, I would say."
18,SEN. FEINSTEIN:  Mr. Panetta:
19,MR. LEON PANETTA:  I would agree with that.
20,SEN. FEINSTEIN:  Mr. Mueller:
21,MR. ROBERT MUELLER:  Agree.

23,"GEN. RONALD BURGESS:  Yes, ma'am, agree."
24,SEN. FEINSTEIN:  Mr. Dinger:
25,MR. JOHN DINGER:  Yes.
26,(End videotape)
27,"MR. GREGORY:  First off, what can you say about the intelligence that's behind such a specific warning like that?"
28,"MR. BRENNAN:  Ever since 9/11, al-Qaeda and bin Laden have been determined to follow through on its earlier attacks here in the homeland.  We have destructed numerous attempts to carry out those attacks here.  They are continuing to train those operatives, they are using different areas of the world.  We see most recently with Mr. Abdulmutallab that Yemen has become an area where al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is attempting to launch those attacks.  So the intelligence is strong that they are continuing to focus on the homeland.  But at the same time, our counterterrorism successes take place every day.  It shouldn't have come as a surprise to anybody that al-Qaeda is attempting to carry out an attack.  They are continuing to have that as one of their priorities.  But we've been able to thwart their plans.
MR. GREGORY:  And how do you win against a threat like this, when CIA Director Panetta was saying that al-Qaeda is adapting its methods in ways that are oftentimes very difficult to detect?"
29,"MR. BRENNAN:  Well, we have to stay more than one step ahead of al-Qaeda, and I think we've been able to do that.  We have increased our security capabilities across the board.  We're working very closely with our partners. They are looking at new technologies.  We are enhancing our screening procedures in the aviation sector as well as other areas.  So we are continuing to look at the types of developments and evolution that they are going through so that we can thwart those attacks.  And we have been very, very successful."
30,MR. GREGORY:  Any credible threats against the Super Bowl today?
31,"MR. BRENNAN:  Not that I'm aware of.  No, not at all.  I--people are very comfortable with the security measures that are put in place for the Super Bowl."
32,"MR. GREGORY:  What, what kinds of attacks is al-Qaeda now interested in pulling off?"
33,"MR. BRENNAN:  Well, I think the Abdulmutallab attempt is a reflection of just how difficult it has become for al-Qaeda to carry out attacks.  He had an improvised explosive device in his underwear.  He was trying to bring down that plane, but it was a faulty device.  And it's because they're unable to carry out these large scale attacks that they are now opting for individual operatives to carry out these smaller scale attacks.  They recognize that they are in need of some type of demonstration of their capability that they have not been able to show.  Because of the tremendous work across the board, not just here in the United States between law enforcement and intelligence, but with our partners, with our Pakistani, Saudi, Yemeni partners.  This is going well from my perspective in terms of continuing to keep the pressure on al-Qaeda."
34,"MR. GREGORY:  How worried are you about sleeper cells in the United States trying to pull off lower level, you know, what in the terrorist world they may call a single rather than a home run, whether it's attacking a shopping mall or this kind of attack?"
35,"MR. BRENNAN:  That's why we have over 100 joint terrorism task forces that the FBI runs here throughout the United States, to make sure that we have eyes and ears throughout this country in the event that there are some sleeper cells that are out there.  Very close collaboration between the FBI and local law enforcement.  We've been able to stop individuals.  Najibullah Zazi, we had David Headley, we have other successes of just over this past year.  So sleeper cells are something we're concerned about, but we have dedicated a lot of resources to uncover them."
36,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk about this political fight over national security as well.  Scott Brown, now the 41st Republican senator, on the night he was--of his victory, when he was celebrating, he said this about the approach that the administration has taken."
37,"(Videotape, January 19, 2010)"
38,"SEN. SCOTT BROWN (R-MA):  And the message we need to send in dealing with terrorists, our tax dollars--our tax dollars should pay for weapons to stop them and not lawyers to defend them."
39,(End videotape)
40,"MR. GREGORY:  A lot of that criticism is about the handling of the Christmas Day bomber, Abdulmutallab, Abdulmutallab--sorry, it's hard to get that name right.  Why was he treated as an ordinary citizen for even the period of time that he was, providing some information, then getting a lawyer after he was given his Miranda rights?
MR. BRENNAN:  He wasn't treated as an ordinary citizen, he was treated as a terrorist.  He was immediately taken into custody, he was questioned under the public safety exception as far as Mirandizing an individual.  FBI agents were there on the ground, as well as with customs and border patrol agents.  We reacted very well to that situation.  He was then put into a process that has been the same process that we have used for every other terrorist who has been captured on our soil, whether they be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens--Richard Reid, Ahmed Ressam, Amari and others.  They were brought into custody by law enforcement officials and then treated accordingly.  So there was no distinction.  And, in fact, the FBI's guidelines that they use, the FBI Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide, was the implementation of the attorney general guidelines that were finalized by Attorney General Casey in the last administration in December of 2008.  That is when those guidelines were put in place.  So the procedures and the protocols were exactly consistent with what we've done before.  Now, after this incident, the president asked us to take a new look and see whether or not those processes are ones that we are comfortable with and whether or not we can enhance and strengthen them.  And that's what we're looking at right now.  But those FBI agents and others acted appropriately.  And, quite frankly, I'm tiring of politicians using national security issues such as terrorism as a political football.  They are going out there, they're, they're unknowing of the facts, and they're making charges and allegations that are not anchored in reality."
41,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let's talk about one of those allegations.  Senator Kit Bond saying that members of the intelligence committee were told not to talk at all about the fact that, that he was now cooperating, that he was speaking to the FBI, and yet, then it gets leaked out to the press after that, saying that the administration was responsible for leaking classified data that they were told to keep under wraps."
42,"MR. BRENNAN:  Again, inconsistent with the facts.  Senator Bond and other senior members of Congress were briefed on Monday about Abdulmutallab's cooperation.  They were told about the fact of that cooperation as well as some information that he was sharing.  During the subsequent day in the hearing it unfortunately came out that that intelligence was starting to flow from Mr. Abdulmutallab.  The press was all on it, this network went out right away and reported that, and so we then wanted to make sure that we were able to the networks and to the media the correct rendition of what happened and how instrumental Mr. Abdulmutallab's family was in getting him to cooperate. And it was a very successful activity on the part of the FBI, Department of Justice, and others, including the intelligence community.  So what we did was to make sure that the facts were out there as best they could be."
43,"MR. GREGORY:  To those that say you have not shared enough information about how you intended to handle him, you say what?"
44,"MR. BRENNAN:  I say that there are sensitive investigations and operations under way, and we're not going to compromise our ability to follow up on that information and to disrupt further terrorist attacks.  And there have been instances when information's been shared with the Hill when we see it in the media the next day.  And we have to be very circumspect as far as what information's going to be shared.  The premium that this president puts on the work of the intelligence and law enforcement community is to disrupt future attacks and to protect the American people...(unintelligible)."
45,"MR. GREGORY:  When you brief some Republicans about what--how he was going to be treated, were they on board with the administration's decision?"
46,"MR. BRENNAN:  On Christmas night, I called a number of senior members of Congress.  I spoke to Senators McConnell and Bond, I spoke to Representative Boehner and Hoekstra.  I explained to them that he was in FBI custody, that Mr. Abdulmutallab was, in fact, talking, that he was cooperating at that point.  They knew that ""in FBI custody"" means that there's a process then you follow as far as Mirandizing and presenting him in front of a magistrate. None of those individuals raised any concerns with me at that point.  They didn't say, ""Is he going into military custody?"" ""Is he going to be Mirandized?"" They were very appreciative of the information, we told them we'd keep them informed, and that's what we did.  So there's been a--quite a bit of an outcry after the fact where, again, I'm just very concerned on the behalf of the counterterrorism professionals throughout our government that politicians continue to make this a political football and are using it for whatever political or partisan purposes, whether they be Democrats or Republicans.  In the last administration, Democrats I felt were speaking incorrectly about the progress that we were making on the terrorism front. The same thing is true today.  And I think those counterterrorism professionals deserve the support of our Congress; and, rather than second-guessing what they're doing on the ground with the 500-mile screwdriver from Washington to Detroit, I think they have to have confidence in the knowledge and the experience of these counterterrorism professionals."
47,"MR. GREGORY:  And through that questioning that's now going on, what are you learning about al-Qaeda specifically in Yemen?"
48,"MR. BRENNAN:  We have known for a while that al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which was a merger of al-Qaeda in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, had a number of senior operatives and individuals who were associated with Osama bin Laden in the past.  Their focus had been on carrying out attacks in Yemen against our embassy about a year and a half ago, in Saudi Arabia an attempted assassination against the senior counterterrorism official within the Saudi government, and that's where their focus was.  What has--what we are now learning is that they have been determined, because of individuals who have been speaking out--Mr. Awlaki and others--focusing on trying to carrying out those attacks in the West, including in the homeland here.  And we have had excellent cooperation from the Yemeni government, we're continuing to work very closely, and we believe we're now ahead of this curve."
49,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me spend a couple of minutes on the proposed trial, civilian trial of 911 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.  If it's not going to be in New York, then where?"
50,"MR. BRENNAN:  First of all we have to remember that the priority is to bring this murderer to justice.  That is what the victims of 911 and their families deserve.  Clearly, we have to take into account the concerns expressed by the state and the city of New York, as well as the sentiments of the Congress. But we are determined to bring him to justice.  We are working with those individuals within Congress who are responsibly dealing with the situation so that we can find the venue and making sure that we are able move forward as quickly as possible, because this individual deserves the full weight of American justice."
51,"MR. GREGORY:  The, the, the attorney general has said, ""Failure is not an option in this case."" Do you have any doubt in your mind that he will ultimately be executed by the United States?"
52,"MR. BRENNAN:  I have no doubt that the American justice system will prevail despite the claims and criticisms of a lot of folks, including in Congress, that our judicial system is unable to handle these terrorists.  I believe that our system of justice here is strong.  And I'm not going to give al-Qaeda the victory of being able to overturn our system of jurisprudence here that is anchored in our Constitution and reflects our values as a people.
MR. GREGORY:  But are you confident he'll actually be executed?"
53,MR. BRENNAN:  I'm confident that he's going to have the full weight of American justice.
54,"MR. GREGORY:  But is he getting all the due process?  If the, if the attorney general says, ""Failure isn't an option,"" other White House officials have said he'll be executed, is this really the shining example of American jurisprudence?"
55,"MR. BRENNAN:  It's going to be the shining example when he is brought to justice, and I'm just--I'm convinced and confident that Mr. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is going to meet his day in justice and before his maker."
56,"MR. GREGORY:  In my remaining couple of minutes, I want to ask you about China and the espionage threat.  China's got a very robust espionage program against the United States.  We've seen what's taken place between Google pulling up stakes from the country.  Dennis Blair, the director of National Intelligence, said, ""The attack on Google's servers from inside China were a wakeup call."" He's warned about a cyber Pearl Harbor.  How serious is this threat from China?"
57,"MR. BRENNAN:  The, the threats and the vulnerabilities within the cyber domain are serious and significant.  That's why President Obama has made it a primary focus of this administration.  We now have a cyber security on board within the White House, Howard Schmidt.  We're looking at these issues from the standpoint of espionage from governments, from different individuals, whether they be hackers or terrorist organizations.  The opportunities to create problems within the cyber sphere are significant and this government is taking steps.  It's a very complex and complicated challenge, but we are working very closely with the private sector.  We're working very closely with the different instruments of government as well as our foreign partners."
58,MR. GREGORY:  Is national security at risk here?
59,"MR. BRENNAN:  National security is something that is at risk, and that's why what we're trying to do is to ensure that our networks, our government networks, our private sector networks, have the ability to withstand these attempts to hack in and to conduct activities, whether it's stealing intellectual property rights or whether it's trying to steal government secrets, or whether it's trying to cause problems or steal one's identity. And that's why this is a shared responsibility--government, private individuals and private sector."
60,"MR. GREGORY:  We will leave it there.  Mr. Brennan, thank you very much as always."
61,MR. BRENNAN:  Thank you.
62,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming next, the economy:  a puzzling jobs report and mounting deficits.  When will the recession be over?  Our exclusive interview with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and former chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan.  Plus, our roundtable delves into the impact of the tea party movement and other political news of the week.  Ed Gillespie and Dee Dee Myers are here.  It's only on MEET THE PRESS."
63,(Announcements)
64,"MR. GREGORY:  Our exclusive interview with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan, coming up after this brief station break."
65,(Announcements)
66,"MR. GREGORY:  We're back and joined now by Henry Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, and Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Welcome, both of you, back to MEET THE PRESS.
Dr. Greenspan, here was the headline in The New York Times yesterday after that Friday jobs report, and it was this:  ""Jobless rate falls to 9.7 percent, giving hope that the worst is over."" Does this jobs report signal a turnaround?"
67,"MR. ALAN GREENSPAN:  It doesn't signal a turnaround, but what it does say is that the turnaround which has already occurred is moving but not in any aggressive manner."
68,"MR. GREGORY:  And Secretary Paulson, if you look at the jobs loss since the recession began, 8.4 million jobs over that time horizon, the question is, what's going to cause a turnaround?  When do you see this, this jobless rate actually stay in the single digits?"
69,"MR. HENRY PAULSON:  Well, the economy is clearly recovering, and I have great confidence that we have such a dynamic private sector in this, in this country that they're eventually going to begin creating jobs.  Now, one of the factors, not the only factor, but one of the factors that will help is more certainty with regard to, to actions out of Washington.  And, for instance, certainty with regard to financial regulatory reform will, will, will help."
70,"MR. GREGORY:  In, in, in terms of not just regulatory reform, what we'll talk about, Dr. Greenspan..."
71,MR. GREENSPAN:  Yeah.
72,MR. GREGORY:  ...but also just the idea of the notion of what the government can do now with regard to a jobs bill or other things to bring down unemployment more steadily.
73,"MR. GREENSPAN:  I think we have to start with the focus of economic activity. In other words, jobs are created by having something to do, so you can't put jobs before economic activity.  And I would therefore argue what would be most useful at this particular stage is cutting taxes on small business, because they are the big creator of jobs, but they won't hire anybody if they don't have any business.  So you have to get them to act in a manner which creates the types of economic activity which draw in an ever-increasing demand for labor."
74,"MR. GREGORY:  And that is a question in terms of what's happening out there. Where, where is the impetus for businesses to start hiring again?"
75,"MR. PAULSON:  Well, again, I, I just believe so much in how dynamic our economic system is and our economy is.  The one thing I know for sure is that, with the economy recovering, ultimately the private sector will do what needs to be done and create opportunities and jobs.  I, I agree with Alan that the--that when you look at a jobs bill, the sorts of things that Congress should be focusing on are temporary incentives for business to, to hire."
76,MR. GREGORY:  And yet is that enough if there's not a business willing to take the risk too extend--expand?
77,"MR. PAULSON:  Well, again, as I said earlier, part of it is confidence and psychology, what's going on inside the head of the CEO and how comfortable does he, he or she feel about the, the future.  But, again, it's very difficult to sit here and say, `Now, where is the economic activity going to come from, which area, which business?'"
78,MR. GREGORY:  Hm.
79,"MR. PAULSON:  But it always does come.  And it will come.  We have stable financial markets and a recovering economy.  It's going to take some time, though."
80,MR. GREGORY:  When is the recession over then?
81,"MR. GREENSPAN:  The recession is over.  It bottomed back in the middle of last year.  And while it doesn't have the strong momentum I had hoped it would have, strangely, because of the fact that we had such a strong fourth quarter, which was essentially using up a lot of the latent power of events, which was the gradual reduction in the rate of decline in inventories.  We did it all in the fourth quarter, and we since--we shot our ammunition.  So it's going to be a slow, trudging thing, but I do think we're going to be moving forward.  And, as Hank says, the issue here is basically innovation.  Innovation by definition is not forecastable, so we don't know where the jobs are coming from.  We don't know how this market is exactly in terms of dynamics going to move forward.  But we know that this process is under way, and there's every reason to believe that it will continue to do so. "
82,"MR. GREGORY:  And you look at the stock market, the fact that it's been on a downward path for the past couple of weeks, down over 6 percent since January, what kind of warning sign is, is that?"
83,"MR. GREENSPAN:  Well, it's more than a warning sign.  It's important to remember that equity values, stock prices, are not just paper profits.  They actually have a profoundly important impact on economic activity.  And if stock prices start continuing down, I would get very concerned."
84,"MR. PAULSON:  I agree with that, but I also never place too much emphasis on what the market does for any week or two.  You need to really look at this just like to you look at economic data over a period of time, and if you look at this over a reasonable period of time, we've, we've seen a, a, a, a very solid stock market."
85,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about the president and about the president's team.  This is something you wrote in your new book, ""On The Brink,"" about election night and a change in leadership.  ""After the Democratic candidate was declared the winner at 11 p.m."" you wrote ""Wendy,"" your wife, ""woke me up to tell me the historic news.  I went back to sleep comforted by the knowledge that our president-elect,"" of course, Barack Obama, ""fully understood the threat our economy still faced."" What do you say now after more than a year? Is that confidence still high in him and his team?"
86,"MR. PAULSON:  Well, what I, what, what I say is this.  The--I take a real comfort in the fact that the programs that were put in place to stabilize the economy were continued and much of, of what has been done has been a continuation or a logical extension of those programs.  I believe the, the financial markets are stable.  I believe the programs have worked.  They prevented the collapse of a--the financial markets, prevented a real catastrophe.  I think we could have had 25 percent unemployment if, if, if, if the system had collapsed.  And I believe that we're going to see that every penny that's been put in the banks is going to come back with interest.  So I think the money's coming back.  So--and that was what I was, what was talking about on election eve, because both presidential candidates had supported the TARP legislation, and I think that was critical.  If they hadn't, we would have been defenseless."
87,"MR. GREGORY:  But you certainly seemed impressed, reading your book, with candidate Obama, frankly more so than Senator McCain.  Did you vote for Obama?"
88,"MR. PAULSON:  Well, who I voted for is between me and the voting booth.  But the, but the, but there's--I was very impressed that candidate Obama was very concerned with what was going on and was, was very supportive.  Candidate McCain, I will admit, gave me a few more anxious days and hours.  But I will also say that as he was falling behind in the polls, it would have been very easy for him to demagogue that issue, play to the populist card.  And if he had come out against what we were trying to do, we wouldn't have got it, I believe.  We wouldn't have had the TARP legislation passed, and we would have been left defenseless."
89,"MR. GREGORY:  Dr. Greenspan, one more question about jobs.  So you think that unemployment rate goes up again before it comes down?"
90,"MR. GREENSPAN:  I'm not sure.  One of the reasons is the official data on unemployment is a sample and it fluctuates, and--as we observed in, in the January report.  If you literally took it seriously as to the exact numbers, there was 784,000 job increase in January.  Now, that didn't happen.  And so that what we can expect is a backing and filling.  I think we're going to stay at approximately the 9 to 10 percent level here for a goodly part of the rest of this year with the sole exception of that period when they start to hire a very large number of census workers.  Remember, this is the decennial census."
91,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
92,MR. GREENSPAN:  And that's going to have some positive effect.  But it's very difficult to make the case that unemployment is coming down anytime soon.
93,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about housing.  A disturbing report on Wednesday in The New York Times talked about people underwater in their mortgages.  ""The number of Americans,"" the paper reported, ""who owed more than their homes were worth was virtually nil when the real estate collapse began in mid-2006, but by the third quarter '09 an estimated 4.5 million homeowners had reached the critical threshold, with their home's value dropping below 75 percent of the mortgage balance.  ...  `Were now at the point of maximum vulnerability,'"" that's according to ""Sam Khater, a senior economist with First American CoreLogic, the firm that conducted the recent research.  `People's emotional attachment to their property is melting into the air.'""
Secretary Paulson, what happens if housing prices go down again when you've already got this kind of precarious situation?"
94,"MR. PAULSON:  It clearly wouldn't be good.  I'm not predicting that.  But what I, I, I think this issue is, is a, a critically important one because it's very difficult for governments to design a program that is going to be effective and going to be fair to taxpayers, a program to keep people in their homes if they don't want to stay in their homes.  And so a, a big part of what we focused on was bringing the private sector together to keep those into their homes that could afford to stay in the homes and wanted to stay there. Now, when you look at the crisis, I think part of the reason that so many experts and so many people didn't foresee housing as being the cause--and, and, and count me among those--was that if you look at our country since World War II, residential housing prices have generally gone up.  We haven't had nationwide declines, and mortgages have generally been perceived to be safe investments.  And so when you get the kind of decline we've had in housing prices, that really, really destroys wealth across the country, but it also changes behavior, because, historically, everyone that had a mortgage would claw, fight, do whatever it took to make the mortgage payment and avoid default."
95,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
96,"MR. PAULSON:  And, of course, when the home is worth less than the mortgage, behaviors tend to change."
97,MR. GREGORY:  What do you see?
98,"MR. GREENSPAN:  Well, I am very much concerned if home prices decline from here.  I don't think they're going to.  In other words, they seem to be bottoming out.  The reason I am is that during 2005 and 2006, as I recall, there were eight million home purchases with so-called conventional conforming mortgages with the 20 percent down payment.  That down payment is gone, and we have this very large block of homeowners who are right on the edge of tilting down into that underwater category.  Fortunately, the evidence suggests that the vast majority, as Hank was implying, of these types of homeowners--that is, those with standard, conventional mortgages--do continue to pay on their mortgages..."
99,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
100,"MR. GREENSPAN:  ...even if the value in the homes is below their--the, the, the market price.  Or rather, what worries me particularly is that there is a very large block that will be thrown on the market, I mean people starting to foreclose, if prices go down significantly from here."
101,"MR. GREGORY:  Let, let me move on, I want to talk about the deficit and I also want to talk about taxes.  Here are the deficit projections from the president's 2011 budget.  And the numbers are, frankly, staggering.  If you look at the deficit for 2010, $1.56 trillion.  And through 2015, they estimate it comes down with 7-point--$751.9 billion.  How serious is this, Secretary Paulson, assuming, also, that tenure projections are often wrong."
102,"MR. PAULSON:  Oh, I, I just have no doubt that it is by far the most serious long-term challenge we, as a nation, face.  All these other issues are--economic issues are minor compared to that, that the, that--and it's a generational issue, because it, it's--there's no way we're going to, to deal effectively with, with the deficit without reforming the entitlement programs--Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security.  And it, it doesn't have to be a, a crisis.  This is something that can be handled.  But one of the things I, I, I talk about in my book and one of the lessons that just hit me right between the eyes, being in Washington, is it's very, very difficult to get Congress to act on anything that's big and difficult and controversial if there's not an immediate crisis.  And so this--so what it's going to take to, to, to get leaders on both sides to come together and deal with this, I, I think is a huge question."
103,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Dr. Greenspan, Larry Summers, one of the president's top economics advisers, has said in the past--he's asked a very provocative question, which is, how long can the world's biggest borrower remain the world's biggest power?"
104,"MR. GREENSPAN:  Not indefinitely, because there's no doubt that if the United States continues down the road that Hank has been correctly identifying, we're going to find that our ability to borrow is going to get restrained because, throughout our history, we have always maintained a capital cushion, a cushion between our borrowing capacity on the one hand and the level of debt on the other.  That is beginning to shrink.  And if we get to the point where we're having difficulty selling our security--our Treasury issues, then interest rates begin to move and our ability to move internationally, to essentially be the major currency, the major economy, the major economic power in the world is significantly diminished.  History tells us that great powers, when they've gotten into very significant fiscal problems, have ceased to be great powers."
105,"MR. GREGORY:  The--part of the fix here, according to the budget, is--has to do with the issue of taxes.  Here's how The Wall Street Journal put it in a headline on Tuesday, and that is that the wealthy face a tax increase.  Those Bush-era tax cuts are going to be allowed to expire by this administration."
106,"Secretary Paulson, is that a bad idea?"
107,"MR. PAULSON:  Here's how I look at taxes.  I believe what we need is broad-based tax reform, and the kind of tax reform where there--it doesn't discourage investments, savings or incentives for those.  Right, right now we have a tax system that, that is biased toward consumption.  It's--and we as, we, we as a people save too little, invest too little, borrow too much.  So I, I, I would like to see wholesale, broad-based tax reform.  And I, I think that's, that's clearly got to be one of..."
108,MR. GREGORY:  My question is whether the Bush tax cuts expiring is a bad idea.
109,"MR. PAULSON:  Well, I've got to say, anything right now that is going to, that is going to, in effect, be a, a, a tax increase has got to be--has got to be questioned.  And an expiring tax cut is a tax increase.  But I'm going beyond that, because I really do believe that we are going to need a--to take a different approach to a number of things--taxes being one of them, housing policies being another."
110,"MR. GREGORY:  Dr. Greenspan, the tax cuts?"
111,"MR. GREENSPAN:  Well, I, you know, I, I agree with what Hank is saying.  I think the thing that disturbed me most in the last week or two was when the discussion was involved in, I believe, in the Senate on the issue of forming a commission--a congressionally-authorized commission, as I read it, there was a 97-to-nothing vote to exclude Social Security from the deliberations of that commission.  That said to me that we have gotten to the point in this country where spending is untouchable.  I have no doubts that we have to raise taxes in order to close this huge deficit.  But we cannot do it wholly on the tax side because that would significantly erode the rate of growth in the economy and the tax base, and the revenues that would be achieved would be far less than anybody'd expect.  We have to recognize the fact that one of the things that we have to do, as tough as it's going to be, is that benefits are going to have to be paired in conjunction with tax increases to resolve this very serious long-term budget problem."
112,"MR. GREGORY:  In our remaining moment here, Secretary Paulson, I have to ask you about financial regulation, about bonuses on Wall Street.  Do you see real changes happening on Wall Street?  Are you frustrated by the level of bonuses we're seeing?"
113,"MR. PAULSON:  Well, you, you ask two questions, and so firstly, there's no doubt that, that compensation on Wall Street, I think, is out of whack and has been out of whack for some time.  And I understand why the American people are unhappy because, you know, in our system we, we expect those that take risk to, to, to, to really bear their own losses.  But I would like to see that, that frustration, that anger channeled toward regulatory reform. And I just think that's very, very critical.  And to me, one thing that is absolutely essential is that we, we, we get strong resolution authority so that, in the future, any type of financial institution, when it faces failure, that, that, that it is liquidated and liquidated in a way in which the taxpayer is not going to have to come up in again and prop up or bail out a financial institution."
114,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We will leave it there.  But before I let you go, here's the picture of you back in the playing days at Dartmouth, here.  So I got to ask--we've got a couple of football fans, because I know, Dr. Greenspan, you are as well.  Super Bowl picks.  Secretary Paulson, you first."
115,"MR. PAULSON:  Well, I'm going to go with the Indiana and Peyton Manning."
116,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
117,MR. GREENSPAN:  It's very difficult to go against Peyton Manning.
118,"MR. GREGORY:  My view as well.  We'll make that the last word.  Thank you both very much.  I should mention we'll continue our discussion with Secretary Paulson and ask him some questions the viewers have submitted via e-mail and Twitter.  It's in our MEET THE PRESS TAKE TWO Web extra.  You can also read an excerpt from his book ""On The Brink:  Inside the Race to Stop the Collapse of the Global Financial System."" Plus, look for updates from me throughout the week.  All on our Web site, mtp.msnbc.com.
And up next, Sarah Palin rallies the tea party, and the 41st GOP senator is sworn in.  How will it all impact the Obama agenda and the 2010 elections? Our roundtable:  Ed Gillespie and Dee Dee Myers are here, only on MEET THE PRESS."
119,(Announcements)
120,"MR. GREGORY:  We are back.  Joined now by Ed Gillespie and Dee Dee Myers.
Welcome both of you to the politics fix here at the end of the program.  So, big news this weekend besides the snowstorm here in Washington.  The tea party movement is in town--not in town, down in Nashville--with their convention. And Sarah Palin had a big showing there, sounding a lot like a presidential candidate, and here's part of what she said."
121,"(Videotape, February 6, 2009)"
122,"FMR. GOV. SARAH PALIN (R-AK):  This was all part of that hope and change and transparency, and now a year later I got to ask those supporters of all that, how's that hopey, changey stuff working out for you?"
123,(End videotape)
124,"MR. GREGORY:  If there was ever a time, Ed, to question where is Sarah Palin going, it seems like this.  She sounded like a candidate last night."
125,"MR. ED GILLESPIE:  Well, she was rallying the troops, very well received, obviously, and she has an incredible capacity to connect with people and with their concerns.  And I, I find myself, David, baffled by some of the consternation about Sarah Palin sometimes, because I find her to be a pretty compelling figure and someone who, obviously, resonated very strongly in that, in that room in Nashville."
126,"MR. GREGORY:  But what role does she play in a Republican Party right now, Dee Dee, where the gains for Republicans in 2009 special elections were won by Republicans like Scott Brown or Bob McDonald in Virginia, or Chris Christie in New Jersey, much more moderate Democrats than the sort of brand of conservatism that she represents?"
127,"MS. DEE DEE MYERS:  Well, but that didn't stop her and the tea party movement last night from taking--for taking--from taking credit for Scott Brown's victory.  And it is interesting, because not only did she rally a conservative base that may or may not be Republican, she went out, out of her way to say her husband's not a Republican and to say that this movement is a warning to both Republican and Democratic officials that maybe they need to look at what they've been doing--how they've been doing business over the last few years. So I'm not sure this is exactly where this is going.  She's clearly positioning herself as a spokesman, if not the leader, of the tea party movement, but is it a third party?  Is it part of the Republican Party?  I don't think that's clear."
128,"MR. GREGORY:  As a movement, what impact does it have for the midterms?"
129,"MR. GILLESPIE:  I think it's going to have a significant impact in the midterms.  Look, I think a lot of these people are new to the political process, and I think Dee Dee's right.  They, they are not Republicans or Democrats, many of them at this point.  They're leery of both parties.  But their overwhelming concerns are about debt and spending and government intervention in our economy and higher taxes.  And I think at the end of the day, as they look at the candidates for them in November, they're going to end up voting for the Republican candidate.  I believe that's what happened for a lot of folks in Massachusetts and other places.  So..."
130,"MR. GREGORY:  Right, but if you--but the question is, if a lot of these folks are motivated by the deficit, as we just talked about..."
131,MR. GILLESPIE:  Yeah.
132,"MR. GREGORY:  ...with Paulson and Greenspan.  This was what USA Today wrote on Friday in an editorial about that. ""The Tea Partiers seem to be promoting more partisanship, not less.  Many are rejecting candidates deemed to be too likely to cross over and reach accommodations with Democrats.  That's a recipe for more debt."
133,"""This isn't to say an uprising against Washington is not merited.  Lawmakers of both parties are simply ignoring the nation's drift toward fiscal suicide. Nor is it the case that populist movements can't serve constructive purposes. The last one - Ross Perot's presidential bid in '92 - forced both parties to focus attention on the deficits, which then turned into surpluses.""
Is there a third way that's brewing here?"
134,"MS. MYERS:  I think it's unclear.  I mean, one of the things we know is that structurally it's very hard to create a third party, to get on the ballot in 50 states to run a credible campaign for president.  But it's not hard to force politicians to take a different position, and that's--I think that's the great question about the tea party.  There's no question that Ross Perot forced the country to take debt and deficit more seriously; and, as a result, President Clinton passed an economic plan that was a combination of tax cuts and spending cuts that really reassured the financial markets and put us on a path from a, you know, $290 billion debt under President Bush, H.W.  Bush, to a $127 billion surplus at the end of Clinton's term.  Can that happen again? We'll see.  Under George W.  Bush we saw the debt go from $5.7 trillion to--he added $4.9 trillion to that debt.  He nearly doubled it.  He nearly, in eight years, did what it took George Washington to Bill Clinton to do.  So Republicans have some 'splaining to do on this."
135,MR. GILLESPIE:  Well it's easy to explain.  We had the attacks of September 11 and the recession that was there when President Bush came in.
136,MS. MYERS:  That is--that's not...
137,"MR. GILLESPIE:  Sure, that had a huge impact, Dee Dee, on..."
138,"MS. MYERS:  That, that's not fair."
139,"MR. GILLESPIE:  Of course it's fair.  It had a huge impact on the economy that we had to recover from, it had a huge impact in terms of federal spending.  But the fact is President Bush's domestic discretionary spending, which President Obama made a big deal out of the freeze, was under one percent when he left office.  The--they increased it by--back to 24 percent..."
140,"MS. MYERS:  But he had huge new entitlements, among other things."
141,MR. GILLESPIE:  ...and have froze in place.  Huge new entitlements that are cheaper than the huge new entitlements that are proposed by Democrats.
142,"MR. GREGORY:  But this, but this debate about deficits is part of what we're talking about..."
143,MR. GILLESPIE:  Sure.
144,"MR. GREGORY:  ...in terms of whether it fuels the third movement.
Let's talk about the president's agenda a little bit.  He--whether it was the, the winter meeting for the DNC here in Washington or speaking to Democrats and rallying them a little bit this week, he said he's not turning his back on health care.  But, at the same time, I spoke to a senior adviser this week who said we're trying to adjust to what the new normal is in Washington.  What is that going to mean for health care?"
145,"MR. GILLESPIE:  I think it means that health care--they may be able to get some things done where there's some common understanding that, that these are reforms that Democrats, Republicans alike can support, maybe things concerning pre-existing conditions, maybe even liability reform, although it's unlikely given the, the strength of the trial lawyers in the Democratic Party.  But there are some areas where you can get--find common ground.  But I think what it means is they've got to talk about jobs.  And the president got to it in the State of the Union, but it's been a year.  And they have burned a year talking about a massive government intervention in the private sector in terms of health care, and they finally realized more Americans out there are worried about their jobs or the economy in general, and they've got to get to that. And I think that's what you're going to see for the next year."
146,"MR. GREGORY:  It's interesting because you also talk inside the White House. They say that the view is they've got to pass health care before they can effectively go out and win the argument about health care.  It makes it very difficult for Democrats who face re-election this year.  When the president met with some senators this past week, this is how the Associated Press summed up the meeting in part:  ""Virtually all the senators who got their hands on a microphone face steep re-election challenges this year, and their moment with the president allowed them to give voice to public dissatisfaction with the economy and Washington.
""Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado:  `This place looks broken to the American people.'
""Senator Bayh of Indiana:  `What should the Democratic Party be trusted?'
""Senator Lincoln of Arkansas:  `Are we willing as Democrats also to push back on our own party and look for that common ground that we need to work with Republicans?'"" The president's got Republican programs.  He's also got Democratic problems."
147,"MS. MYERS:  Right.  There, there, there's no question this was--this is a difficult moment.  It's a bit of a ""come to Jesus"" moment for the, for the administration and for Democrats.  And I think that's why you've seen President Obama making a much more loud pitch for, for new job legislation. He's been talking about jobs.  He says that's priority one of his administration now.  And that's going to have to be a bipartisan bill, and the president has acknowledged as much.  It's going to include tax cuts, and we'll see if the Republicans will be for what they're for and vote for a bill that will help not just the country but might help Democrats.  Once you've passed a job bill, then you've got to do something about health care.  And I think the president has made clear he's not abandoning health care, he isn't going to go out there and, you know, be the leader, he's going to let Congress continue to do that.  But he's going to work behind the scenes, as he as, to, to try to push members to pass it.  If they don't pass it, I think the president has said, ""What does that say about our ability to govern?"""
148,"MR. GREGORY:  And you get all the downside of this debate and none of the upside, is the view.  Is the Democratic majority in real jeopardy, as you look at the landscape?"
149,"MR. GILLESPIE:  Oh, absolutely, it's in real jeopardy.  I've felt for some time that the House majority is at great risk of, of going Republican in November.  And I think increasingly you're looking at significant gains in the Senate.  We just saw this week with Senator Coats declaring in Indiana against Evan Bayh.  We've seen now John Boozman going to run in Arkansas.  We saw Beau Biden say he's not going to run in Delaware where Mike Castle obviously puts it heavily in his favor.  So, across the board, we're seen opportunities for Republicans that we didn't seen, certainly, six months ago, and I think Scott Brown's election obviously has had a major impact on recruiting and, and decisions by candidates."
150,"MR. GREGORY:  That, that assumes some level of support for Republican rule, which is certainly not evidenced in the polling."
151,"MS. MYERS:  Right.  I mean, the Democrats' losses have not been Republicans gains.  I think Democrats need to run like they're afraid of losing both houses of Congress.  But that said, I think you can make a strong argument about the economy, about health care.  You know, the president needs to do a better job of talking about what will happen if we don't pass health care. And then after health care passes, should it pass, he needs to remind people that their lives will be better because of it.  He's got to--you know, this isn't something that's going to--that Republicans are going to cede without a fight."
152,"MR. GILLESPIE:  Were not going to cede without a fight.  But let me make the point in terms of Republicans.  It's true that people aren't self-identifying as Republicans in big numbers right now.  It's also true that Republicans won the governorship in New Jersey, won the governorship in Virginia, won the Senate seat in Massachusetts.  And on the congressional generic ballot, when asked if you were likely to vote for the Republican or the Democrat come November, we have a 2 to 4 point advantage, which we haven't seen in over a decade.  So I think there's a real opportunity here.  And I do believe at the end of the day, if, if we get the opportunity to get the majority again and we demonstrate a commitment to fiscal discipline, you will see more people self-identify as Republicans.  But in the meantime, they're voting Republican. That's the most important thing in the short term."
153,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we're going to leave it there.  Ed Gillespie, Dee Dee Myers, thank you both very much."
154,"Before we go, it is, of course, Super Sunday, and we all know what that means. Sid the Kid vs.  Alex the Great.  The Washington Capitals take on the Stanley Cup champions, the Pittsburgh Penguins.  It's the NHL on NBC at 12 Noon.  And yes, I'm so excited because I will be there.  Now, as for that other game, our executive producer, Betsy Fisher, would be angry with me if I did not say ""Go, Saints."""
155,"That's all for today.  We'll be back next week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday:  Washington paralyzed by snow and the capital's politics still in a deep freeze.
    "
1,(Videotape)
2,PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  Bipartisanship cannot mean simply that Democrats give up everything that they believe in.
3,(End videotape)
4,"MR. GREGORY:  Is bipartisan agreement possible given deep divisions over a jobs bill, the administration's handling of terror suspects, and health care? We'll ask our guest, Vice President Joe Biden, joining us from Vancouver, Canada, the site of the Olympic Games.
Then, the governing challenge:  How should the White House reframe its agenda after a bruising first year, a sour electorate, and a unified opposition? Insights and analysis from our roundtable:  New York Times columnist David Brooks; MSNBC's Rachel Maddow; chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, former Congressman Harold Ford of Tennessee; and Republican Congressman Aaron Schock of Illinois."
5,"But first, the vice president of the United States.  We spoke to him late last night from Vancouver."
6,"Mr. Vice President, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS."
7,"VICE PRES. JOE BIDEN:  It's good to be back with you, David."
8,"MR. GREGORY:  You are there, of course, at the Winter Games, and there's been mixed emotions as the games have begun, incredible pride and excitement after the opening ceremonies, but also the tragic death of that luger from Georgia. Give me your impressions of the mood and of the games so far."
9,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  Well, exactly how you described it.  I met with Misha Shalikashvili--Saakashvili last night, the president of Georgia, and it was obvious it was--it really had hit home with him and his team.  But the way--the reception that the Georgian team got when they walked into the arena was heartening, and, and I think that--I think people are basically dedicating the games to the young man, and they're moving on.  But it's an exciting atmosphere, notwithstanding the opening tragedy."
10,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me turn to some of the issues that you and, of course, the rest of the administration are dealing with.  Let me start with terrorism and the controversy surrounding the proposed trial of alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.  The attorney general ordered a civilian trial to be held in New York.  Now it appears that that decision has been withdrawn.  It's unclear what's going to happen.  The reason for a civilian trial as given by the president and others was a question of perception, that it was very important that the rest of the world see that we'd treated Khalid Sheikh Mohammed fairly.  But hasn't the administration already made the decision that even if he were to be acquitted that he would never be released?"
11,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  Look, there's no doubt that he would not be acquitted; the facts we have are overwhelming.  We're absolutely confident he will be convicted in whatever for he is tried.  The attorney general made the decision that he should be tried in the court of the greatest jurisdiction, which was in New York City.  There has been significant response coming from the city and congressional delegation requiring the president to have to take a look at this again.  That decision as to where he's going to be tried and exactly when is something that is being considered right now.  But he will be tried..."
12,MR. GREGORY:  But Mr. Vice President...
13,VICE PRES. BIDEN:  ...he will be held accountable.
14,"MR. GREGORY:  But wait a minute, you--but the question I asked is whether a decision has already been made that even if he were to be acquitted, he would never be released."
15,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  David, I'm not going to speculate on that.  He will not be acquitted; he will be found guilty.  He will be in jail, and he will stay there.
MR. GREGORY:  But here is what the attorney general said last November on this question of what would happen if he were acquitted.  This is what he said:
(Videotape, November 18, 2009)"
16,"ATT. GEN. ERIC HOLDER:  If there were the possibility that a trial was not successful, that would not mean that that person would be released into, into our country.  That, that would--that is not a possibility."
17,(End videotape)
18,"MR. GREGORY:  It's rather clear what he's saying:  If he were acquitted, he's not going to be released in America.  I can't imagine the United States is going to release him somewhere in the Middle East or elsewhere around the world.  So isn't the conclusion that he's going to stay a prisoner of the United States.  And, if that's the case, despite your confidence in his conviction..."
19,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  No, it's not the case."
20,"MR. GREGORY:  ...despite your confidence in conviction, what is--where is the fairness--the perception of fairness in our system?"
21,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  David, he--the, the--what the attorney general said, he would not be released into America, that is a fact.  But we're not even going to have to get to that place.  I'm not going to speculate on what would happen to him if, in fact, he were acquitted.  I assure you, I assure you, acquitted or not, he will not be walking the streets of the United States of America. He will not be acquitted."
22,"MR. GREGORY:  By such statements, are you prejudging the trial, and doesn't that undercut the, the goal of fairness by the rest of the world in our judicial system?"
23,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  No, look, I'm part of a team that heads up the prosecutorial apparatus of the federal government.  We are confident in our case."
24,MR. GREGORY:  Are you ruling out a military commission?
25,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  Name me a prosecutor--I am not ruling anything out.  What I am telling you is he will be held accountable under the law.  We have improved military commissions considerably.  The fact of the matter is, the only reason there's any discussion going on about whether or not the trial will take place in an Article III court in the court of jurisdiction with the broadest jurisdiction, New York City, is because of the response of the Congress requiring the president to have to consider the consequences of failing to heed their, their, basically, their, their concerns.  So this is a discussion taking place.  The decision will be made by the president.  He will be held accountable.  A military tribunal is available.  It is the less preferable way to go.  But one way or another, he will be held accountable."
26,MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about some of the criticism that's been leveled at this administration by former Vice President Dick Cheney.  He has argued that this administration has failed to treat the fight against terrorists as war.  He cites the decision related to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to offer him a civilian trial as one example.  Giving the Christmas Day bomber the privileges of the American criminal justice is another example.  The decision to shut down the Guantanamo Bay prison.  What do you say?
27,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  Let me choose my words carefully here.  Dick Cheney's a fine fellow.  He's entitled to his own opinions.  He's not entitled to rewrite history.  He's not entitled to his own facts.  The Christmas Day bomber was treated the exact way that he suggested that the shoe bomber was treated, absolutely the same way.  Under the Bush administration, there were three trials in military courts.  Two of those people are now walking the streets; they are free.  There were 300 trials of so-called terrorists and those who had engaged in terror against the United States of America who are in federal prison and have not seen the light of day, prosecuted under the last administration.  Dick Cheney's a fine fellow, but he is not entitled to rewrite history without it being challenged.  I don't know where he has been. Where was he the last four years of the last administration?"
28,"MR. GREGORY:  What about the general proposition that the president, according to former Vice President Cheney, doesn't consider America to be at war and is essentially soft on terrorism?  What do you say about that?"
29,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  I don't think the vice--the former vice president, Dick Cheney, listens.  The president of the United States said in the State of the Union, ""We're at war with al-Qaeda."" He stated this.  And by the way, we're pursuing that war with a vigor like it's never been seen before.  We've eliminated 12 of their top 20 people.  We have taken out 100 of their associates.  We are making--we've sent them underground.  They are, in fact, not able to do anything remotely like they were in the past.  They are on the run.  I don't know where Dick Cheney has been.  Look, it's one thing, again, to, to criticize; it's another thing to sort of rewrite history.  What is he talking about?"
30,"MR. GREGORY:  You, you have often said, when I've asked you and others, that you never impugn a man's motives, but why do you think Dick Cheney is speaking out and being so critical of the president and the administration so publicly?
VICE PRES. BIDEN:  I don't know.  I, I, I'm not going to guess about his motive.  All I know is he's factually, substantively wrong on the major criticisms he is asserting.  Why he's insisting on that, he either is misinformed or he is misinforming.  But the facts are that his assertions are not accurate."
31,"MR. GREGORY:  You would not be this outspoken or critical when you're out of office, is that fair to say?"
32,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  Well, I, I would hope I, I--look, it's one thing to be outspoken.  It's another thing to be outspoken in a way that misrepresents the facts.  And I, I just--again, I--it's almost like Dick is trying to rewrite history.  I can understand with--why that would be, you know, an impulse.  And maybe he isn't--literally, I'm not being facetious, maybe he's not fully informed of what's going on.  I mean, the progress we have made.  There has never been as much emphasis and resources brought against al-Qaeda.  The success rate exceeds anything that occurred in the last administration.  And they did their best.  I'm not, I'm not impugning their effort.  It's just simply not true that the president of the United States is not prosecuting the war against al-Qaeda with a vigor that's never been seen before.  It's real, it's deep, it's successful."
33,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me move on to some other issues.  I want to ask about some other foreign policy matters in just a couple of minutes.  But let me turn to the economy.  You said on Friday that Democrats facing re-election this fall will do just fine if Americans see, ""tangible, visible evidence"" that the economy is turning around, it's creating jobs.  Well, here are the facts:  You came into office, the unemployment rate was 7.4 percent, it's now 9.7 percent. Where is that evidence?"
34,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  Well, look, I'll tell you where the evidence is.  We came into office--and let's get the facts straight.  The month we were sworn in, 740,000 people lost their jobs; 640,000 the next month, before we could get our, our, our, our, our computers hooked up accurately in the, in the West Wing.  We had an economy that shrunk at 6 percent the quarter before we took office.  We found ourselves with our financial institutions not only needing to reorganize, but in threat of shuttering their doors and moving the world into a literal depression.  We found the housing market absolutely tanking for 32 months in a row.  Here we are 11, 12 months later, we're in a situation where the economy grew at over 6 percent--or, excuse me, 5.8 percent the last quarter, where we are--stopped the hemorrhaging of jobs and are now going to begin to produce jobs on a monthly basis, where the housing market is stabilized, where no bank is in jeopardy.  And now we're turning our attention to reviving small town banks, commercial banks so we can get credit flowing again.  I--we have pulled us back from the brink, we have made genuine success, and now we're in the process of having--moving forward and the--building the kind of economy that is not built on a bubble, a housing bubble, not built on a dot-com bubble.  We're investing in the future, including technology, the new green economy, etc.  This is going to take time."
35,"And my point was, David, it's understandable why, when you're sitting in your kitchen table and your wife or husband lost their job and you're worried about your job, where you're not sure you can send your kid back to college this year, where you're--can't get any help to care for your elderly parent, there's no wonder you're sitting there and feeling angry.  But there's going--tangible evidence, tangible evidence that the path we've put the country on, that we're moving it in the right direction has become more and more apparent.  And by the time we get around to November, in addition to bringing home 90,000 American troops out of Iraq, the story of this administration is going to be more clearly told and we're going to do just fine.
MR. GREGORY:  But if--there's not going to be tangible evidence of a turnaround if the jobless rate is as high as it is.
VICE PRES. BIDEN:  David, look, the neighborhood I grew up in, and I suspect the neighborhood you grew up in, no one sat at the, no one sat at the kitchen table talking about the jobless rate.  They talked about their job.  My grandpop used to have an expression:  When the guy up on Olyphant was out of work, it was a slowdown; when your brother-in-law was out of work, it was a recession; when you're out of work, it's a depression.  This is a depression for a lot of people.  Not only are we moving to be able to provide them the ability to get jobs by putting a lot of focus on small business, the engine of job creation, through tax cuts, through capital gains cuts, through a $5,000 tax credit for employing people; in the meantime, we're working on things that affects the quality of their life.  We're making sure their kid's going to be able to stay in college and pay back that college loan.  We're helping--we're going to be helping them this year with child tax credits.  We're going to help them with their--with elder credit.  We're going to make sure that they are able to begin to save for their retirement by automatic 401(k) programs withheld from their--or excuse me, automatic retirement programs set up by their employers where they can have part of their pay automatically taken out and saved.  There's a lot of things you do simultaneously beyond just creating jobs, which we have created or saved over two million jobs thus far.  Put another way, instead of seven million people being unemployed, there would have been nine million people unemployed this year.
MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But, but do, do--you have to concede..."
36,VICE PRES. BIDEN:  But that--but less bad is not good enough.
37,"MR. GREGORY:  Wait a second, Mr. Vice President.  Mr. Vice President, you have to concede, that figure that you use so often, economists say there is no way to accurately measure the impact of the stimulus on jobs saved or, or job creation.  That is a number that cannot be verified."
38,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  Well, I do not agree with that.  I know economists will tell you that.  We use the same, we use the same econometric models economists have been using for the last 25 years to measure growth and to measure loss. That--you cannot say with absolute certainty what the job loss is either. It's based on an estimate of who files and how and when.  Look, David, there is no reasonable economist that I know of, no econometric model that suggests that we have not created a minimum of 1.6 million to 2.4 million jobs.  Even The Wall Street Journal last quarter acknowledged that the significant reason for the growth in the third quarter was because of the investments of the recovery package.  They went on to say, but that's not good because once the recovery money is not there things are going to change.  That--so you can't have it both ways."
39,MR. GREGORY:  Let me...
40,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  The fact that you stimulate the economy and it actually grows, no one doubts that the recovery package played a major part in that."
41,MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about health care.
42,VICE PRES. BIDEN:  Yep.
43,"MR. GREGORY:  Back in January, it was reported that you said to the president, given the country's fiscal situation, it was not wise to try to pursue healthcare reform.  Given what's happened, given the trouble that healthcare reform is now in, do you think that that advice should have been followed?"
44,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  Well, first of all, I'm not acknowledging what advice I gave.  The advice I give to the president is private.  That's why he keeps asking for it, and as long as it stays private."
45,"I think the president made the right judgment in deciding that in order to bend the cost curve and prevent people from being victimized by health insurance costs that we had to move and we had to move aggressively.  And the president is still committed to making sure that we do three things:  One, make sure that those whose premiums are now continuing to skyrocket in fact are brought under control; making sure that the money the federal government spends on health care, 46 cents on every dollar, spent is through Medicare and Medicaid, that we bend that cost curve to gain control of the future, of our future fiscal situation; and making sure the insurance companies can't engage in the kind of practices they do with pre-existing conditions and limits on coverage, etc."
46,"We've invited the Republicans down to the White House.  It is my sincere hope that they all say there's a real problem.  If they're willing and they have ideas that can better deal with those three problems, we're ready, willing and able to listen; and we're anxious to.  But we think it's absolutely essential for the economic health of this country that we move forward on health care."
47,"MR. GREGORY:  I wanted to get back to a few areas of foreign policy, away from the domestic, and that's Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan.  When I last interviewed you on this program eight months ago, this is what you said when I asked you whether President Obama would be the president to stop Iran from going nuclear or allow it to go nuclear.  Here's--was your response."
48,"(Videotape, June 14, 2009)"
49,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  He's going to be the president that stopped it, God willing.  We are not going to allow Iran to go nuclear any more than the rest of the world is going to allow it to go nuclear."
50,(End videotape)
51,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet eight months later, no real progress on that front.  Do you still believe that to be the case, given Ahmadinejad's claim this week that, indeed, Iran is a nuclear power?
VICE PRES. BIDEN:  It is not a nuclear power.  I can understand why Ahmadinejad would make that assertion to divert the world's attention from the abuse of the civil liberties and civil rights of the people of Iran.  But let's get the facts straight.  The fact is that, number one, we've made significant progress.  You have Iran more isolated internally by its own people than it has been in the last 20 years.  In the region, they're completely isolated.  We have the, we have the support of everyone from Russia to Europe, and I believe we'll get the support of China, to continue to impose sanctions on Iran to isolate them, to make it clear that, in fact, they cannot move forward.  The progress that Iran has made on the nuclear front is greatly exaggerated, in my view.  If you take a look at what's happened--anyway, I think we've made significant progress.  We are no longer the issue in the world, Iran is the issue."
52,"MR. GREGORY:  Couple of other issues quickly, if we can.  On Iraq, you said this week that it will turn out to be one of this president's great achievements.  What did you mean?"
53,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  What I meant by that is I think he has taken office and managed the situation incredibly well in Iraq.  We are now moving toward a position where there is actual political accommodation among factions who were killing one another just two years ago.  We are going to be in a position to bring home 90,000 combat troops by the end of the summer.  There will be a successful election, I predict, in Iraq, where there's full participation by the Sunnis, Shia, Kurds and other minorities.  You are seeing the Iraqis now working.  And we have worked very, very hard.  I've made a total of 17 trips to Iraq, four just this year, working with each of the, each of the parties. I think they are working--it will be a great tribute to the Iraqi people and, I think, to the government that we've managed this transition, they've managed the transition well."
54,MR. GREGORY:  Was the war worth it?
55,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  No, I don't think the war was worth it in the sense that we paid a horrible price, not only in loss of life, the way the war was mishandled from the outset, but we took our eye off the ball, putting us in a much different and more dangerous position in Afghanistan.  We lost support around the world.  It's taken a lot of hard work to get it back.  But we were handed--we were dealt a hand, and I think we're handling it incredibly well. I--that's presumptuous to say.  I think we're handling it very well, the Iraqis are handling it well.  And we build on the positive things that the Bush administration had initiated, and we have jettisoned those things that were negative."
56,"MR. GREGORY:  You, you mentioned Afghanistan.  There is a large offensive under way by American and allied forces now in southern Afghanistan.  What will be achieved through that?"
57,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  Well, the hope is what will be achieved is we'll get further cooperation from the people in the region, the Pashtun tribes who will see more accommodation coming out of the Taliban, who--most of whom are Pashtun, realizing that they cannot realize their expectations through intimidation and force.  And we will be in a position where the Iraqi forces that are leading this effort are more seasoned and more capable and more able to handle their own security interests over time."
58,"MR. GREGORY:  Finally, Mr. Vice President, about the Olympics, now, there are a lot of hockey fans in this country, including my seven-year-old son, who follow teams like the great Washington Capitals with great Russian players. I'm going to show you a picture of two of them, Alex Ovechkin and Alexander Semin.  Now they are playing for Team Russia, and it's creating a lot of divided loyalties, my son now saying he's rooting for Team Russia over Team USA.  What should, should a father do about this?"
59,"VICE PRES. BIDEN:  I don't have that problem, and I would--well, David, I never give another man advice on how to deal with his children.  Having three myself, I, I, I don't presume to tell anyone else.  I think your son's a great hockey fan.  Tell him that they chose to live in the United States and work and play for the Capitals, and, and that's what they, that's what he should focus on."
60,"MR. GREGORY:  I'll go with that.  I'll see where it gets me. Mr. Vice President, thank you, as always."
61,VICE PRES. BIDEN:  All right.
62,"MR. GREGORY:  And up next, the governing challenge for the Obama administration in the face of a sour electorate and unified opposition. Insights on it all from our roundtable, David Brooks, Rachel Maddow, Democratic former Congressman Harold Ford Jr., and Republican Congressman Aaron Schock."
63,(Announcements)
64,MR. GREGORY:  Reaction to the vice president and the politics of jobs and national security.  Our political roundtable weighs in right after this brief commercial break.
65,(Announcements)
66,"MR. GREGORY:  And we're back.  Joining us now, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, New York Times columnist David Brooks, former Democratic Congressman Harold Ford Jr., and Republican Congressman Aaron Schock.  He is the youngest member of Congress, the first to be born in the '80s, we should point out.  He represents the 18th District of Illinois, which includes Peoria, the seventh largest city in that state, and he's been chosen by his party's leadership to serve as a deputy Republican whip, and even received a waiver to serve on three committees in the House instead of the usual two. So welcome to the program for the first time."
67,"A lot to get to, all of you.  David Brooks, the national security fight.  You heard Vice President Biden taking on his predecessor.  This is now a fully engaged argument about whether the Obama administration is sufficiently serious when it's taking on the war on terror.  He said of Cheney, he's either ""misinformed or misinforming."""
68,"MR. DAVID BROOKS:  On the big picture he's right.  I mean, if you cover the Obama administration, they take it seriously.  The idea that they don't know we're at war, they don't pay attention, they have the daily intelligence briefs.  They take this utterly seriously.  So Cheney's large charge is completely bogus.  As for the specifics, I think there are a couple of things he's right about.  The KSM trial has become a total mess.  What Joe Biden said today on the program doesn't pass the laugh test.  The idea that we're going to try a guy, not acquit him, apparently, if, beforehand, are we going to make Dick Cheney the foreman of the jury?  I mean, how do we know that?  And then let him walk three.  The second, free.  And then the second thing I think Cheney's actually right about is Mirandizing.  We, if we--say we'd captured the 9/11 guys on September 10th, or one of them, should we have read that guy his rights and given him a lawyer?  No.  We should have tried to get some intelligence out of the guy.
MR. GREGORY:  Rachel?"
69,"MS. RACHEL MADDOW:  There--there's--there isn't, in this case, and there hasn't been in any known modern terrorism case, any correlation between the usefulness of an interrogation and whether or not somebody gets read their Miranda rights.  It just isn't the case.  And in every single instance, every single terrorism case where there's been an arrest in this country in a terrorism case since 9/11, every single one has been handled--the person has been handled as a civilian criminal.  There was a moment when Jose Padilla and, and Ali al-Marri were handed--handled in military custody.  There's nothing magic about the time that they were in military custody.  They didn't do any more magical forms of talking that they wouldn't do when they were civilians. So, even on those grounds, I think that, I, I think what you see as being correct in the, in the vice president's charges, I just, I just don't think it's there."
70,FMR. REP. HAROLD FORD JR.  (D-TN):  Furthermore...
71,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
72,"REP. FORD:  ...I think it's only fair, this president has been as tough as anyone's been on terrorists.  Throughout the--throughout his campaign, he promised he was willing to go into Pakistan if need be.  He was criticized by Republicans and Democrats.  As you heard Vice President Biden, they've taken down several of the top 20 that we wanted to find in Afghanistan and Iraq. Our efforts in Afghanistan, 35,000 additional troops, some in the Democratic Party were opposed to it.  This president charged ahead.  The efforts in the last few days.  I think it's--we can point around the edges a bit, but I think it's unfair to say this administration has not been tough, has not been focused and determined in going after terrorists."
73,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman Schock, did--the accusation that is still leveled and that former Vice President Cheney in an interview this morning is saying, is that the administration does not consider these acts acts of war.  They are still considering them criminal acts, which he says is the wrong way to keep America safe."
74,"REP. AARON SCHOCK (R-IL):  Well, look, all I can tell you is what my constituents are telling me and where I think most of Americans are, which is they see an American citizen who attacks our soldiers at a, at a base in Fort Hood, Texas, tried in a military tribunal.  And they see a foreigner who comes to our soil for the sole purpose of attacking our country and our American citizens and he's read his Miranda rights.  The majority of Americans, the polls indicate, do not support the president and this administration's plan to try these people in civilian court.  And I think it's rightfully so why the administration is now backpedaling on their decision to hold these trials in downtown New York."
75,MS. MADDOW:  I...
76,MR. GREGORY:  Let me just take on one issue and then you can make your point.
77,MS. MADDOW:  OK.
78,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to go back to the, the Khalid Sheikh Mohammed trial, because I think this is the point that I was trying to ask the vice president about.  Here was the headline in The Washington Post this week about how this is unfolding politically, which is not well for the administration.  Obama to help pick the location of the terror trial, which can only be seen as a shot against his attorney general and his decision originally to put it in New York, which they reversed from.  The tension here, Rachel, the whole reason why there are enemy combatants is to say these are warriors, they're not criminals.  They--the president says that al-Qaeda is trying to destroy America, that we are at war.  So these are warriors.  And by virtue of the fact that the administration is saying, ""We're never going to release this guy even if he were to be acquitted,"" does that not make the point that they should not even enter our justice system where there is due process, where there is a presumption of innocence, where any prosecutor knows the consequences that the defendant walks if they--they're not convicted?
MS. MADDOW:  I, I think that in--even in the case of heinous crimes that have nothing to do with terrorism, that have nothing to do with foreign nationals, there is a, there is a frustration that there's a case that people who we believe are guilty might somehow get away.  There's this frustration.  That's what drives lynch mob mentality.  I mean, we've always had that sort of tension.  But the fact remains, there have been three convictions under military tribunals, three, and two of the people convicted are now free.  It's no great guarantee that anything awesome is going to happen in terms of guaranteeing guilt and guaranteeing a long sentence to do the, to do the tribunal route.  When the--when, when Richard Reid came up in civilian court and he tried to make the case that he wanted to be called a soldier, he wanted to be called--he wanted to be treated in the terms of war, the judge in the case, William Young, said, ""You are not an enemy combatant.  You are a terrorist.  You are not, you are not a soldier in any war.  To call you a soldier gives you far too much stature.  War talk is way out of line in this court.  You're a big fellow, but you're not that big.  You're no warrior.  I know warriors.  You are a terrorist, a species of criminal guilty of multiple attempted murders."" I think Americans cheer that sentiment, and the idea that we're going to elevate Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and call him some sort of warrior when he's comparing himself to George Washington at Guantanamo, it's disgusting."
79,"MR. GREGORY:  But, David Brooks, the president is spending a great deal of political capital on a decision that was being made to put him in the civilian system so that the rest of the world thinks we're fair.  And yet, the vice president this morning is saying, ""He's going to be convicted.  He's going to die."" Other administration officials, including the president, has said that, that he'll most likely face the, the death penalty.  How is this holding up American jurisprudence?"
80,"MR. BROOKS:  Yeah, well, this is a policy in transition.  Eric Holder, the attorney general, took this decision without consulting the president, without consulting the national security apparatus, did it on his own.  And slowly, and now quickly, the White House is pulling that back.  And so they are going to try to, I think, take--well, take it out of New York.  But they're not there yet.  The idea that we can try someone and, and guarantee a conviction and guarantee they won't walk free, I mean, this, this is a betrayal of our values.  I mean, what--the, the correct charges against Gitmo were that it's a betrayal of our values.  We're fighting our values in a way that--we're fighting this war in a way that betrays who we really are.  And this is the essence of that.  What Joe Biden said on the program today will be laughed at around the Arab world."
81,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman Schock, the larger question of Republican dissent, if you look at it that way, or attacks on this administration, the top terrorism adviser to the president said this on this program this last week.
(Videotape, February 7, 2010)"
82,MR. JOHN BRENNAN:  I'm tiring of politicians using national security issues such as terrorism as a political football.
83,(End videotape)
84,MR. GREGORY:  Are Republicans and Republican attacks against this administration helping al-Qaeda?
85,"REP. SCHOCK:  Absolutely not.  And I think it's insult to most Americans to suggest that their elected representatives who are carrying their views and the message of, of the majority of Americans to Washington and to this debate are somehow helping al-Qaeda.  Mind you, these are the--many of these Democrats, including Mr. Brennan who served in the last administration, faced many of these same attacks under then-President Bush from, from the left.  So the idea that we can't challenge the administration and their view on the fight on terrorism is completely bogus."
86,MR. GREGORY:  What happened to Democrats when they challenged President Bush in the same way?
87,"REP. SCHOCK:  Well, some of the same, some of the same claims were made against them."
88,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
89,"REP. SCHOCK:  But at the end of the day, we're representing mainstream America and the majority of views.  And, and whether it's closing Guantanamo Bay and moving it to the heartland of America, whether it's the, the--trying these folks in downtown New York, whether it's Mirandizing terrorists who come to this country to attack us, the majority of Americans have not bought, do not believe, that Obama and his administration is right on these policies."
90,MR. GREGORY:  So you don't support the way the president is prosecuting the war on terror?
91,REP. SCHOCK:  No.
92,"REP. FORD:  I, I, I, I can appreciate the, the politics that are at play here, and we're heading into a cycle, and we just met.  I think he's a nice guy and a good guy, but to suggest that this administration is not focused in a right way and determined to keep America safe I, I think is just, is, is just not right and foolish.  I think there's a legitimate conversation about whether Khalid Sheikh Mohammed should be tried in my home city.  I disagree with the administration, I'm glad now we are revisiting and looking at a different location.  I was against it because I think the costs are too high. We're in the middle of a recession.  It would cost some $225 million a year to try him there.  We could spend that money in a jobs program, an education program or even to pay down the debt.  But to suggest--to play politics at this moment--Democrats raised the same concerns when Bush was in office and the same answers were given and--some similar answers were given by Republicans.  The truth of the matter is Congress and the Senate ought to be focused on our efforts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and ensuring that our AfPak policy works.  The conversation around Pakistan and Kashmir and whether or not a resolution there will help us resolve our issues in Afghanistan are far more important than a volleyball going back and forth about who's at fault.  Barack Obama and his administration deserve tremendous credit for what they've done up to this moment."
93,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Quick, quick comment, then I want to move it to domestic matters."
94,"REP. SCHOCK:  First of all, I want to make it clear:  Nobody's suggesting that President Obama and his administration don't want us to be safe.  What we're suggesting is he's taking unnecessary risks."
95,"MS. MADDOW:  Well, well, can I just..."
96,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Yeah.
97,"MS. MADDOW:  I'm sorry, though.  What's the basis of the assertion that reading somebody their Miranda rights is unsafe?  We did that with every..."
98,"REP. SCHOCK:  Well, Rachel, you said yourself..."
99,"MS. MADDOW:  Wait, hold on.  We did that with every single person who has been arrested on terrorism charges since 9/11.  Nobody's ever made an issue of it until the Obama administration and this case with Abdulmutallab. Literally, what's, what's the problem with being read your rights that wasn't the problem before?"
100,"REP. SCHOCK:  Well, first of all, you suggested earlier that reading someone's Miranda rights does not--has never indicated that they talk less to our intelligence folks."
101,MS. MADDOW:  We've never heard that from the FBI.
102,"REP. SCHOCK:  The fact of the matter is we do know that after the Christmas Day bomber was read his Miranda rights that he did, in fact, stop cooperating with our intelligence.
MS. MADDOW:  That's not true, actually.  I mean, it's not what we know from the people who've been involved in that.  It's just..."
103,"MR. GREGORY:  But there is--but, but the..."
104,"MS. MADDOW:  The, the factual basis of these assertions is so thin."
105,MR. GREGORY:  But the...
106,"REP. FORD:  Rachel's right about that.  In fact, I think when he was read the rights, a report suggested that he shared more information after that.  And that could be wrong, but the question..."
107,"MR. GREGORY:  But there, but there is a debate, there is a debate about whether he should have been treated throughout as an ""intelligence asset"" without being Mirandized in order to bring people in who had more expertise specific to Yemen.  Now I don't think any of us can know at this stage how much could be gleaned from FBI interrogators, who are very good..."
108,MS. MADDOW:  Yeah.
109,"MR. GREGORY:  ...vs. other intelligence assets.  So I think that debate will continue.
Let me take a break here.  We're going to come back and talk about domestic matters in the Obama agenda.  We'll be back with our roundtable right after this brief station break."
110,(Announcements)
111,"MR. GREGORY:  We are back now with our political roundtable.  Let's talk about the Obama agenda.  And you may not have known this or heard about it, but we had a fair amount of snow here in Washington over the past couple of weeks.  Here is a cartoon that really captures the nexus between government and weather.  Huge snowstorm, one guy says, ""Washington is completely paralyzed."" The other one says, ""And then came this snow storm."" And here, here we are, David Brooks, with a domestic agenda right now.  And what's leading this off?  It's not health care at the moment, it is a jobs bill.  And there seemed to be bipartisan consensus on this and now Majority Leader Harry Reid pulled it back, made it a much narrower bill by $15 billion, mostly of tax breaks, to get people back to work.  Is this going to go anywhere?"
112,"MR. BROOKS:  It'll go somewhere.  But if, if this was your week to hate Washington, this was a good week for you, because we got this bipartisan bill that emerged in the Senate filled with pork and all sorts of things that people hate.  Fine.  But at least the White House signs off on it.  But Harry Reid decides after the White House has signed off on it that it's--the liberals in his party have objected.  So we got the pork, and he decides, ""I'm getting rid of the whole thing,"" or at least scaling it back to something about $15 billion a year.  So then we get partisanship.  And then on top of that, it's basically pointless.  Fifteen billion dollars a year in a multitrillion-dollar economy is nothing, will create no jobs.  So we had partisanship, pork, and pointlessness all in one bill.  And so this was a bad week for Washington."
113,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman Schock, where are the Republicans going to be on this?"
114,"REP. SCHOCK:  Well, look, I think, unfortunately, it's more of the same.  I mean, all of this talk about bipartisanship, and yet the rhetoric doesn't match the reality.  As David Brooks mentioned, there was some, some Republicans who worked with Democrats in the Senate to come up with a jobs bill only to have their leadership put the kibosh on it.  We, we are for creating long-term economic growth.  You do that by incentivizing entrepreneurialism, risk taking, and investment.  You do that through creating certainty in the markets through certain tax incentives.  And that's where we'll be on a jobs bill."
115,MR. GREGORY:  So it sounds like you're--you like what the Democrats are doing here?
116,"REP. SCHOCK:  Well, I don't like all the pork that was in the bill.  Seven hundred eighty-seven billion dollar stimulus bill, the largest spending bill in, in history, one of the reasons why it didn't create long-term growth is it didn't have stimulative tax cuts in it, but rather a lot of pork and spending."
117,"MS. MADDOW:  Which are the least stimulative things in the stimulus.  I mean, when you assess what creates jobs, in the stimulus band it's the tax cuts that were put in in order to try to win Republican votes that didn't come anyway that are the least effective thing in the stimulus bill.  So the theory doesn't match the practice here."
118,"But, I mean, you, in your district..."
119,"REP. SCHOCK:  Well, I, I can assure you..."
120,"MS. MADDOW:  ...just this week you were at a community college touting a $350,000 green technology education program, talking about how great that was going to be for your district.  You voted against the bill that created that grant.  And so that's happening a lot with Republicans sort of taking credit for things that Democratic bills do, and then Republicans simultaneously touting their votes against them and trashing them.  That's, I think, a, a, a problem that needs to be resolved within, within your caucus, because, I mean, you seem like a very nice person, but that's very hypocritical stance to take."
121,"REP. SCHOCK:  Well, Rachel, with all due respect, I can assure you Republicans were not consulted on the stimulus bill.  That bill was filed at 11 PM the night before the 10:30 AM we began debating it.  None of our amendments were considered.  There was no debate and no bipartisanship on that bill."
122,MS. MADDOW:  How about the...(unintelligible)?
123,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but answer--all right, let me, let me jump in here Rachel, which is that the, the question about you--you've called for spending caps out of Washington."
124,REP. SCHOCK:  Sure.
125,"MR. GREGORY:  But to Rachel's point, does that mean that you will not accept any federal money that comes the way of your district?"
126,"REP. SCHOCK:  No.  I think that argument that liberals are making is absolutely ridiculous.  With all due respect, Rachel, does that mean you're going to give back your Bush tax cuts that you continue to rail against?  The fact of the matter is our country operates and govern by a majority.  And I, along with almost all of my Republican colleagues and a good number of Democrats, have voted against the stimulus, the omnibus, all of this runaway spending.  But we've lost those battles in the House.  And at the end of the day, my constituents..."
127,"MR. GREGORY:  But you'll take the money for, you'll take the money for your district."
128,MS. MADDOW:  Take the money and tout it...(unintelligible).
129,"REP. FORD:  Here's, here's, here's a..."
130,"REP. SCHOCK:  Well, let me finish.  At the end of the day, my constituents and their children and grandchildren will be on the hook for the debt that's being created by this majority..."
131,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
132,REP. SCHOCK:  ...and they deserve to have their fair share of federal spending.
133,MR. GREGORY:  Harold's turn.
134,"REP. FORD:  I was in Congress for 10 years.  I can tell you, your party ran up a lot of debt.  Matter of fact, we, we grew--from the eight years that President Bush was there, the rate of growth exceeded any other presidents in the history of the nation.  So we found ourselves in a moment..."
135,REP. SCHOCK:  Until this one.
136,"REP. FORD:  Well, no, this, this president, he's only been in a year.  I know you want to blame him for everything, but you can't blame him for quite everything yet.  And I don't want to blame President Bush, but we got to put it in context.
Two, I, I love it when Republicans talk about the desire to come around the table and work together.  It was a Republican-Democrat thing that happened in the Senate.  It was Grassley and Baucus, and it was Hatch and Schumer. They're--that was the centerpiece of the, of the stimulus bill and the jobs bill that's working its way through the Senate.  But it was McConnell who told Reid the other day, ""I will not work to, to, to collect any votes for this bill if you bring it to the floor."" There has to be a genuineness and a sincerity here.  Republicans say they want deficit reduction and deficit control, they vote against a deficit commission.  I do hope President Obama will use an executive order to create a deficit commission in spite of what Republicans may say.  You can't have it one day Monday in the morning and have a different message in the afternoon on, on, on Tuesday."
137,MR. BROOKS:  But can I say this?
138,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
139,"REP. FORD:  I think it just has to be fair.  Now, Democrats deserve some blame here."
140,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
141,MR. BROOKS:  Yeah.
142,"REP. FORD:  But Republicans have to be, have to be honest, too."
143,"MR. BROOKS:  This conversation exemplifies what's wrong with Washington. It's like two guys fighting in the ocean to see who drowns first.  I mean, the--it's--both parties are responsible for the, the deficits, and both parties are responsible for the fiscal suicide.  And if you look at the polls that came out--a whole bunch of polls came out this week and they show both parties very negative.  Unprecedented levels of distrust in Washington. Unprecedented, historically high levels of people want to get rid of their member of Congress from both parties.  A level of distrust of Washington that is absolutely unprecedented in American history.  And it's because the two sides are trying to fight each other than actually do something bipartisan or actually do anything."
144,"MS. MADDOW:  No, but..."
145,"MR. BROOKS:  And so bipartisanship has become a wedge issue, a way to make the other party look bad.  So bipartisanship has been twisted into just another partisan rant."
146,"MS. MADDOW:  But the issue is not bipartisanship qua bipartisanship.  It's hypocrisy.  I mean, if you are for PAYGO, if you're for a deficit commission until the president of the other party comes around for it, and then you're against it?  We're not talking policy anymore, we're not talking about bipartisanship.  You shouldn't be blamed for not getting Republican votes on that.  That's hypocrisy.  If you vote against the omnibus bill, if you complain about the omnibus bill, if you tout your vote against the omnibus bill, it is hypocrisy to then go to your district and go to a ribbon cutting ceremony for something that's funded by the omnibus bill that you voted against.  It's not just bipartisanship as a sort of platonic virtue."
147,"REP. FORD:  But, but...(unintelligible)."
148,"MR. BROOKS:  Listen to the Republicans point, Republicans say--I can pick up the Democratic points.  If, if Obama wants to say, ""I'm going to balance the budget,"" and then say, ""but I won't cut taxes on the bottom 98 percent,"" well, that's also somewhat hypocritical or inconsistent.  If he says..."
149,MS. MADDOW:  Or that's focused policy.
150,"MR. BROOKS:  ...""I want bipartisan health care,"" but then invites the, the cameras into a bipartisan discussion and already has the plan he's going to come with--out with after the healthcare summit, that's also slightly political."
151,"REP. FORD:  David, David's right about one thing, and it's the bigger point for my party.  I was astonished by what happened with the jobs bill also.  We are in the majority, we have an obligation to govern.  And the American people react in revolt when politicians feel like they know what voters want.  Health care is important.  But if we don't focus on jobs and jobs and jobs again, I think Vice President Biden was right, Democrats will suffer in the fall.  The reality is families are having problems at home, businesses are having problems running themselves--or I should say, people running them are having problems.  And the reality is people are worried about their future.  And, ultimately, your point is the right one.  I only make the point about the back and forth of it.  There has to be some honesty about bipartisanship.  You can't in the morning say you want it, and in the afternoon everything is undermined."
152,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let's, let's talk about the prospect of bipartisanship when it comes to health care.  The president will have a summit on February 25th.  The cameras will be on.  There'll be Republicans and Democrats there to talk about the issues.  The truth is, Congressman, that healthcare reform is in trouble.  But are the Republicans, on health care, prepared to say yes to anything?"
153,"REP. SCHOCK:  Absolutely.  From day one back in April, I joined with over a hundred Republican colleagues of mine on a letter with John Boehner and Eric Cantor to the president, who said, ""Mr. President, we want to work with you on healthcare reform.  We have ideas.  We want to meet with you."" And for the good part of that year, the president spent his, his, his time only working with Democratic members.  And it wasn't until the losses in New Jersey and Virginia and, subsequently, the Scott Brown election in Massachusetts that have forced them to the table to talk about truly wanting to work with us. Unfortunately, yesterday we learned that, that Speaker Pelosi and Harry Reid are now trying to develop a new bill before the February 25th summit.  If that's the case, I think it's unfortunate.  We need to start from scratch, which is where the American people are on this issue.  They have overwhelmingly rejected both the House and the Senate versions.  And if the president was--is willing to start from scratch, is truly willing to be a negotiator, meet us halfway, where the American people are, we will support it."
154,"MR. GREGORY:  Rachel, how difficult is it that the White House clings to the belief that the best way to win the argument on health care is to pass it first?  It's a very difficult way to apply leverage on Republicans to cooperate."
155,"MS. MADDOW:  Well, I mean, the last time that we had, we had, we had Republicans in to do a bipartisan summit--or the first time we had Republicans in for a bipartisan summit at the White House, right, was March of last year? We spent the entire summer while this Senate Finance Committee didn't meet--Senate Finance Committee, with three more Democrats on it than Republicans.  So instead, this bipartisan group of six could meet to try to work it out.  The Republicans in the House proposed four planks that they wanted in health reform.  They wanted buy insurance across state lines, allowing individuals to pool together, state innovation, and tort reform. Versions of all of those things are in the bill.  Famously, in April, President Obama said, ""If I'm willing to go a lot further than I have on tort reform, what are you willing to give?"" Republicans said nothing.  ""We're not really--we're literally not willing to give anything in exchange for that."" So the idea that it's just now that Democrats want to sit down with Republicans is, again, just--it's factually wrong, even though it's Beltway common wisdom."
156,"MR. GREGORY:  David Brooks, will there be reform this year?"
157,"MR. BROOKS:  I would say the chances are 70 percent no.  I mean, I mean, I don't think there's going to be much of a deal.  I think the, the big picture is few--average, like, the last 10, 15 polls on the Democratic healthcare reforms, it's against probably 55 no, 38 percent yes, something like that. It's just hard to do a big national transformation when the public's leaning against."
158,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But that's something you wrote this week, that ""voters are in no mood for a wave of domestic transformation."""
159,MR. BROOKS:  Right.
160,MR. GREGORY:  Were they initially?
161,"MR. BROOKS:  I don't think so.  I think, you know, we had a period between 1932 and '64 where people basically trusted their government.  And that ended because of Vietnam and Watergate and a lot of other reasons.  When the president came in, it was not like '32 and '64.  People had this incredibly high level of distrust.  And if they had this economic security and you come at them with an institution they distrust with a whole bunch of change, they're going to have even more insecurity.  They're going to recoil.  I think that's what's happened.  I think the president would have been wiser to go step by step to rebuild that trust in government.  I still think that's what you should do today."
162,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me--I want to talk about 2010 politics, and I want to turn to you, former Congressman Ford.  The question of whether you're going to run to challenge New York Senator Gillibrand in New York.  You're being coy about this, and yet everything you're doing has the hallmark of you being a candidate.  Are you going to run?"
163,"REP. FORD:  I haven't decided yet.  I'll make a decision in the next few weeks.  I'll have to tell you, the travels around the state have been great, encouraged, humbled by what people are saying.  The press and the pundits are focused on carpetbagging and some of the politics around it, but people in New York are expressing the same concerns that have been--that we've been expressing around the table.  There's a big concern about health care but a bigger concern about the economy and jobs."
164,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let's talk about some of the carpetbagging issues.  One of the questions that's come up is, are you a really a New Yorker?  Do you pay taxes in New York?  Have you filed at least a partial return for the time you've spent there?"
165,"REP. FORD:  Absolutely.  Paid taxes on all New York income the last two years.  And, for the first time, in '09 my wife and I will file as residents of New York.  But this is politics.  They've tried to distort my record on choice, my record on other social issues.  But, at the end of the day, voters in New York are as unsettled and as worried about their futures as any other set of voters across the country.  At the end of the day, many people in the state don't know Senator Gillibrand, don't know a whole lot about her.  But there'll will be time, if I run, to litigate that line by line."
166,"The bigger issue, I think, is what, is what David has raised and partially what, what the congressman has raised here.  Democrats, we are in a position to make things happen.  People are no longer interested in keeping score in Washington.  They want outcomes.  And, at the end of the day, if we're not seeing or not able to show how we're producing jobs and at least mindful of reining in the size and the growth of government because every business, every household is reining it in, I hate to use the example of being in the airport and listening to someone share with me how they're sitting around their table, cutting back.  And they said, ""You better, if you get there, make government cut back."""
167,MR. GREGORY:  But...
168,REP. FORD:  We've got to be mindful of that as Republicans and Democrats.
169,"MR. GREGORY:  Bigger picture's important, but so is accountability on some issues, including a couple of others that have come up for you.  There's so much talk and anger about bonuses on Wall Street.  You have worked for Merrill Lynch.  Are you going to release how big your bonus was with Merrill Lynch and other tax return information to voters now?"
170,"REP. FORD:  David, if I become a candidate, I was in Congress for 10 years so I understand disclosure."
171,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
172,REP. FORD:  The simple answer is yes.  But I'm not a candidate yet.  I've answered questions throughout.
173,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
174,"REP. FORD:  And, again, I understand.  What..."
175,MR. GREGORY:  But you won't say how big your bonus was with Merrill?
176,"REP. FORD:  I had a contract with Merrill Lynch.  They--I had a certain things I--number of things I had to do.  I satisfied that, and I was paid.  I make no bones about it.  New York City, New York state depend heavily on Wall Street.  I'm a believer it ought--the system ought to be reformed, but putting a tax on banks at a time at which the recovery is as timid and as fragile as it is--680,000 New Yorkers work in this industry.  The importance of the revenue to the city and to the state of New York, I'm, I'm not afraid..."
177,MR. GREGORY:  So what...
178,"REP. FORD:  ...nor am I ashamed to say, if I run for the Senate and I win, I will defend the biggest industry in my state."
179,MR. GREGORY:  So how big was the bonus?
180,"REP. FORD:  David, if I run for office, I'll, I'll talk about all of those things.  And I'll..."
181,"MR. GREGORY:  What about--the question of whether you're pro choice or pro life has come up.  Final question on this, which is would you support parental notification in New York, something it now does not have?"
182,"REP. FORD:  I have--in the Congress, I've voted against late-term abortion--voted for--against late-term abortions.  I am pro choice.  The record has been distorted.  The president of a--the Tennessee Planned Parenthood has said that Harold is pro choice.  He's a friend.  My wife is pro choice.  I can assure you--who I wish happy Valentine's Day to this morning--if I were not pro choice, my wife nor my mother--Mom, happy Valentine's Day, too..."
183,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
184,REP. FORD:  ...they neither would allow me in their homes if I were not.
185,"MR. GREGORY:  Parental notification in New York, do you support it?
REP. FORD:  I'm for--I'm for parental notification other than extreme cases, where a judge may have to be involved if there's, if there's a dispute between a child and a family.  If you--if your daughter can't go to an NR-17 movie, David, without some notification, it would seem to me that a family ought to be made aware of some of these."
186,"MR. GREGORY:  Rachel Maddow, bigger picture on 2010 politics.  What do you think the president can be saying now to Democrats who fear that this is a repeat of 1994 in this regard, the prospect of losing on healthcare reform, being stymied on healthcare reform just as they were stymied on the crime bill as well, that chaos theory that Democrats can't achieve.
MS. MADDOW:  Yeah.  I think that, that, that, when Nancy Pelosi noted this week that 200 bills have passed the House that have been sitting in the Senate, not--going nowhere, and 70 percent of those, more than 70 percent of those, had more than 50 Republican votes when they passed the House, is a key of what's going wrong.  There's a real problem in the Senate, and the Democrats need to be able to show that they're doing the things the country needs to be done in this difficult economy and with a broken Senate that can't do it.  And I think that what they're going to need to do, both practically to get stuff done and to show voters that they're serious about it, and that they're not wusses and they can't get rolled the way Republicans love to roll them is by actually taking on what's broken in the Senate."
187,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Congressman Schock, what is the reason that Americans should restore Republicans to power in Congress?"
188,REP. SCHOCK:  Because there needs to be some balance in Washington.  You mentioned '94.  I think...
189,"MR. GREGORY:  Where's, where's the imbalance now?  The president hasn't achieved the big things he's trying to get."
190,"REP. SCHOCK:  Well, I think his, his agenda is clearly out of touch with mainstream America.  It's why we had a rock star president a year ago with over 80 percent favorabilities and now he's below 50 percent.  It's because cap and trade, the stimulus, healthcare bills are out of touch with where America wants us to be.  And the Republican Party has been where we--the American people have been, which is talking about jobs, talking about the economy, talking about tax cuts to get our economy going again.  That's what America wants us focused on.  And despite the president continuing to talk about jobs, their stimulus packages and bills continue to just spend."
191,"MR. GREGORY:  Thirty, 30--David Brooks, 30 seconds, the outlook."
192,"MR. BROOKS:  Well, it's going to be a good year for Republicans.  I'm actually beginning to think, for the first time in my life, there's a prospect for a third party at some point in the future.  I just don't see how we get out of the fiscal hole if Republicans are not willing to raise taxes, Democrats not willing to cut spending.  I just don't see how we get out of that, and that is the predicate.  For the first time in my life I've thought maybe somebody could run a third party for president, not for Congress this year."
193,MR. GREGORY:  Modern day Ross Perot.
194,"MR. BROOKS:  Hopefully a little saner, but, yeah."
195,MR. GREGORY:  OK.  We're going to leave it there.  The debate will certainly continue.  Thank you all very much.
196,"I should point out, we're going to continue our discussion with Congressman Schock and talk to him about life as the youngest member of Congress.  It's in our MEET THE PRESS Take 2 Web extra.  It's up this afternoon.  Plus, look for updates from me throughout the week.  It's on our Web site mtp.msnbc.com."
197,And we'll be right back.
198,(Announcements)
199,"MR. GREGORY:  That is all for today.  We'll be back next week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, facing down the threats to America across the globe.  A top Taliban leader is captured in Pakistan amid a large allied push against insurgents in Afghanistan.  How will it impact the war?  In Iraq, troop levels are down to the lowest point since 2003, but when will U.S. servicemen and women finally come home for good?  And Iran, it continues to defy the West and may be closer to producing a nuclear warhead.  Can anything be done to stop it?  Our exclusive guest this morning, the man overseeing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, General David Petraeus.
    "
1,"Then, the future of the Republican Party playing out at a gathering of conservatives here in Washington."
2,(Videotape)
3,FMR. VICE PRES. DICK CHENEY:  I think Barack Obama is a one-term president.
4,(End videotape)
5,"MR. GREGORY:  Joining us this morning, an often-mentioned GOP contender to challenge President Obama in 2012, Governor Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota."
6,"Finally, Washington gridlock.  Is the problem petty politics or leadership? Insights and analysis from our roundtable:  The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne; The Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan; chairman of the House Republican Conference, Congressman Mike Pence of Indiana; and chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Congressman Chris Van Hollen of Maryland."
7,"But first, General David Petraeus joins us live from U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida.
General, welcome to MEET THE PRESS."
8,"GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS:  Thanks, David.  Good to be with you."
9,MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk about Afghanistan.  This NATO-U.S. offensive in southern Afghanistan is entering its second week with reports of resistance from the Taliban that our forces are facing.  How formidable are the Taliban forces that we're confronting now?
10,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, they're formidable.  They're a bit disjointed at this point in time.  The way the operation was conducted leaped over some of them. But there's tough fighting going on, without question.  If I could, David, in fact, I'd like to put this into context, because this is just the initial operation of what will be a 12-to-18-month campaign, as General McChrystal and his team have mapped it out.  We've spent the last year getting the inputs right in Afghanistan, getting the structures and organizations necessary for a comprehensive civil-military campaign, putting the best leaders we can find in charge of those, helping with the development of the concepts, the counterinsurgency guidance General McChrystal has issued and so forth.  And then now, with President Obama's policy announcement in December at West Point, the resourcing of that effort with the additional 30,000 forces that have now begun flowing, about 5,400 on the ground already, the additional civilians, the additional money, the additional authorization of Afghan security forces.  So the inputs, we think now, are about right, and now we're starting to see the first of the output.  And the Marja operation is the initial salvo, the initial operation in that overall campaign."
11,"MR. GREGORY:  The fight is going to be tough.  As you have said, there are questions about how long the U.S. will be there in the fight, whether the Afghan army is capable enough to take over that fight.  What should Americans expect as there's more engagement, as there's more fighting, in terms of U.S. losses?"
12,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, David, the same as in the surge in Iraq.  When we go on the offensive, when we take away sanctuaries and safe havens from the Taliban and the other extremist elements that we and our Afghan and coalition partners are fighting in that country, they're going to fight back.  And we're seeing that in Marja.  We will see that in other areas.  But we are going after them across the spectrum.  We have more of our special, special operations forces going in on the ground, and you've seen the results, you've heard some of the initial results of that with more Afghan shadow governors, the Taliban shadow governors being captured, more of the high value targets being taken down. Then, through the spectrum of providing additional security for the people, supporting additional training of Afghan security forces, as I mentioned, 100,000 more of those over the course of the next year and a half or so.  And then also, out on the local defense and even the reintegration of reconcilables effort that will be pursued and is being pursued with the Afghan government."
13,"MR. GREGORY:  But U.S. losses, significant?"
14,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  They'll be tough.  They were tough in Iraq.  Look, I am--I have repeatedly said that these types of efforts are hard, and they're hard all the time.  I don't use words like ""optimist"" or ""pessimist,"" I use realist.  And the reality is that it's hard.  But we're there for a very, very important reason, and we can't forget that, David.  We're in Afghanistan to ensure that it cannot once again be a sanctuary for the kind of attacks that were carried out on 9/11, which were planned initially in Kandahar, first training done in eastern Afghanistan before the attackers moved to Hamburg and then onto U.S. flight schools."
15,"MR. GREGORY:  As the offensive is taking place in southern Afghanistan, a major development in Pakistan, in neighboring Pakistan, as U.S. and Pakistani authorities captured a major Taliban figure, Abdul Baradar.  What are you learning from him now that he's in custody?"
16,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, David, if I could, what we've learned, actually, in working with our Pakistani partners, who have done some very impressive work over the course of the last 10 months in particular, is that it's sometimes not best to talk a great deal about intelligence operations.  And that's what I'll do here this morning."
17,"What I will say is, again, I'd like to put this into context as well.  Some 10 months or so ago, the Pakistani people, their political leaders, including major opposition figures and even the clerics, all recognized the threat posed to the very writ of governance of Pakistan.  They saw this as the most pressing existential threat to their country, and they supported the Pakistani army and Frontier Corps as it went into Swat and the Malakand division of the northwest frontier province and then expanded its operations into the federally administered tribal areas.  They've made some significant gains. They know they can't just clear and leave.  They have to clear, hold, build and, over time, transition to local security forces.  That's indeed what they're endeavoring to do.  They are carrying out this fight.  This is their fight against extremists internal to their country, threatening Pakistan, not them fighting our war on terror."
18,"MR. GREGORY:  Can I ask it a slightly different way, if you don't want to talk about what specifically is being learned?  Presuming that both U.S. forces and Pakistani officials are doing the interrogation, do you wish you had the interrogation methods that were available to you during the Bush administration to get intelligence from a figure like this?"
19,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  I have always been on the record, in fact, since 2003, with the concept of living our values.  And I think that whenever we have, perhaps, taken expedient measures, they have turned around and bitten us in the backside.  We decided early on in the 101st Airborne Division we're just going to--look, we just said we'd decide to obey the Geneva Convention, to, to move forward with that.  That has, I think, stood elements in good stead.  We have worked very hard over the years, indeed, to ensure that elements like the International Committee of the Red Cross and others who see the conduct of our detainee operations and so forth approve of them.  Because in the cases where that is not true, we end up paying a price for it ultimately.  Abu Ghraib and other situations like that are nonbiodegradables.  They don't go away.  The enemy continues to beat you with them like a stick in the Central Command area of responsibility.  Beyond that, frankly, we have found that the use of the interrogation methods in the Army Field Manual that was given the force of law by Congress, that that works.  And..."
20,MR. GREGORY:  Well...
21,GEN. PETRAEUS:  And that is our experience...
22,MR. GREGORY:  In terms of recruitment threats...
23,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  ...in, in the years that we have implemented it."
24,"MR. GREGORY:  In terms of recruitment threats, do you consider the prison at Guantanamo Bay in the same way?  Do you consider it to be related, or do you think, in other words, should it be closed, or do you believe it was short-sighted to set a deadline certain for its closure?"
25,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  I've been on the record on that for well over a year as well, saying that it should be closed.  But it should be done in a responsible manner.  So I'm not seized with the issue that it won't be done by a certain date.  In fact, I think it is--it's very prudent to ensure that, as we move forward with that, wherever the remaining detainees are relocated and so forth, whatever jurisdiction is used in legal cases and so forth, is really thought through and done in a very pragmatic and sensible manner."
26,"MR. GREGORY:  One more question about--on the subject of terrorism.  You often say when it comes to politics, you like to go around the minefield rather than go through it.  But this is a question, really, related to your experience and your expertise.  In the past couple of weeks, there's been a big debate about what kind of threat al-Qaeda poses directly to the United States.  Vice President Biden considers another 9/11 type attack unlikely. Former Vice President Cheney, who you served under as well, said that he disagrees with that, that 9/11 is indeed possible again, this time using a nuclear or biological weapon.  Again, appealing to your expertise, where do you come down on that question?  What is the specific threat that al-Qaeda poses now?"
27,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, let me just express how we assess al-Qaeda in the Central Command area of responsibility, which happens to be where the bulk of al-Qaeda is located; although, certainly, the network extends beyond our area. And our assessment is that over the course of the last year or so, al-Qaeda has been diminished in that area, that Saudi Arabia and the other Arabian Peninsula countries have continued to make gains with the exception, obvious exception of Yemen--we can talk more about that if you want--that the, the progress has continued against al-Qaeda in Iraq, although, again, there are certainly remaining threats there.  And we see those periodically shown in the form of horrific, barbaric attacks.  There's been progress against al-Qaeda's senior leadership in the federally-administered tribal areas as well.  So, as a general assessment, again, diminished.  But, having said that, al-Qaeda is a flexible, adaptable--it may be barbaric, it may believe in extremist ideology, as it does, but this is a thinking, adaptive enemy, and we must maintain pressure on it everywhere."
28,MR. GREGORY:  But...
29,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  It is a network, and it takes a network to keep the pressure on a network.  And that is, indeed, what we're endeavoring to do."
30,"MR. GREGORY:  But, general, my question is do you think they want to pull off another 9/11 or smaller bore attacks?"
31,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well I think al-Qaeda is assessing to pull off any kind of attack.  I mean, you saw the Abdulmutallab attempt on--the, the would-be Detroit bomber.  Again, this is an enemy that is looking for any opportunity to attack our partners and, indeed, our homeland, and we have to keep that in mind.  There's no question about its desire to continue to attack our country and our allies."
32,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about Iran.  International inspectors think that, in fact, that country is moving toward production of an actual nuclear warhead.  How close is that regime to going nuclear?"
33,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well it's--it is certainly a ways off, and we'll probably hear more on that from the International Atomic Energy Agency when it meets here in the, in the next week or so.  It has clearly--its new director has expressed his concern about the activities.  There's no question that some of those activities have advanced during that time.  There's also a new National Intelligence Estimate being developed by our intelligence community in the United States.  We have over the course of the last year, of course, pursued the engagement track.  I think that no one at the end of this time can say that the United States and the rest of the world has--have not given Iran every opportunity to resolve the issues diplomatically.  That puts us on a solid foundation now to go on what is termed the ""pressure track."" And that's the course in which we're embarked now.  The U.N. Security Council countries, of course, expressing their concern.  Russia now even piling on with that. We'll have to see where that goes and whether that can, indeed, send the kind of signal to Iran about the very serious concerns that the countries in the region and, indeed, the entire world have about Iran's activities in the nuclear program and in its continued arming, funding, training, equipping and directing of proxy extremist elements that still carry out attacks..."
34,MR. GREGORY:  But...
35,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  ...in Iraq, albeit on a much limited basis, but still do that there, and also pose security challenges in southern Lebanon, Gaza, and elsewhere."
36,"MR. GREGORY:  But over the span of now two administrations so much has not worked in terms of the pressure option on Iran.  Can a single country, be it the United States or Israel, deter Iran from going nuclear without a military strike?"
37,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, again, I think we have to embark on the pressure track next, but certainly they're, needless to say--you know, I was asked a couple of Sundays ago on another show, ""Well, tell me, General, about your plans to take down Iran's nuclear program."" And the way I answered was to, to note that it is the job of combatant commanders to consider the what-ifs, to be prepared for contingency plans.  I'm not saying this in a provocative way.  I'm merely saying that we have responsibilities, the American people and our commander-in-chief and so forth expect us to think those through and to be prepared for the what-ifs.  And we try not to be irresponsible in that regard."
38,"MR. GREGORY:  In our remaining moments, I want to cover a couple of other areas.  Iraq:  Of all the countries within Central Command that you oversee, 20, would you consider Iraq to be the most democratic?"
39,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  It's interesting.  I've actually posed that question to think-tankers and others, and I think it actually may be.  Now, we hope that that is sustained through the elections and beyond 7 March.  Right now it--I don't think there's any question right now that the Iraqi government, however imperfect--and this is ""Iraqracy"" at work, not necessarily Western democracy. But this is a government that is representative of all of the people, it is responsive to the people, it, its leaders know they are facing the electorate on 7 March.  There's a fierce campaign, there's high political drama that's gone on.  Some of it is of concern in, in a substantial way to elements to the Iraqi population and leadership.  But we hope that this will move through, that the elections will be, as were the provincial elections in January 2009, deemed free and fair by the United Nations, which is very much supportive of this effort, needless to say; and that, indeed, the process of selecting the next prime minister, the next government and the other leadership will be a smooth one.  Although, frankly, we expect that it is going to take some time. And, again, we do expect that there's going to be considerable drama and emotion that accompanies it, and it will be a period of months, at the very least, before that second election, if you will, the election of 7 March, which selects the parliament, the council of representatives; and they then will do the wheeling and dealing and the maneuvering to select the next prime minister and the key ministers and president."
40,"MR. GREGORY:  General, with the, the military engaged in two wars, with a country fighting terrorism in other forms as well, is this an appropriate time for the military to revisit the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy?"
41,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, there's a process at work here now, David, and I, and I think that it is a very sound and good process.  The secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs announced, when they were testifying, the creation of a review be headed by General Carter Ham, U.S. Army four-star, and DOD General Counsel Jay Johnson.  I don't think this has gotten enough prominence frankly.  It is very important to this overall process.  It will provide a rigorous analysis of the views of the force on the possible change. It will suggest the policies that could be used to implement a change if it, if it does come to that, so that it could be as uneventful as it was, say, in the U.K.  or the Israeli militaries or, indeed, in our own CIA and FBI.  And then it will assess the effects, the possible effects on readiness, recruiting and retention."
42,MR. GREGORY:  What do you say?
43,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Very important for that process to move forward.  We'll hear from the chiefs, the Joint Chiefs on this I think, probably their personal assessments and personal views in the course of the next week or so..."
44,MR. GREGORY:  But...
45,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  ...when they're on Capitol Hill.  And then the geographic combatant commanders, the other combatant commanders and I, will have our turn on Capitol Hill in a few weeks."
46,"MR. GREGORY:  But what, but what, what do you say, General?  Should gays and lesbians be able to serve openly in the military?"
47,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Well, I'll provide that, again, on Capitol Hill if, if asked at that time.  I, I know you'd like to make some news here this morning.  I support what our secretary and, and chairman have embarked on here.  I will--I'm fully participating in that process.  And I think it's very important, again, that these issues be handled and discussed and addressed by this review that will be so important in informing decisions as we move forward."
48,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think soldiers on the ground in the field care one way or the other if their comrades in arms are gay or lesbian?
49,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  I'm not sure that they do.  We'll see.  Again, that's why this review panel.  You know, all we have are, are personal soundings to go on, and I've certainly done some of that myself.  I mean, you've heard General Powell, who was the chairman when the policy was implemented, had a big hand in that, who said that, yes indeed, the earth has revolved around the sun a number of times since that period 15 months (sic: years) ago.  And you've heard a variety of anecdotal input.  We have experienced, certainly, in the CIA and the FBI, I know.  I served in fact in combat with individuals who were gay and who were lesbian in combat situations and, frankly, you know, over time you said, ""Hey, how's, how's this guy's shooting?"" Or ""How is her analysis,"" or what have you. So--but we'll see.  Again, that's the importance of this review that will be conducted by General Hamm and also by the DOD general counsel.  I think it is hugely important that we have the answers from the questions that they'll be asking in a very methodical way, something we've not done before because of the emotion and the sensitivity of this issue."
50,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we'll leave it there.  General Petraeus, thank you very much this morning."
51,"GEN. PETRAEUS:  Great to be with you, David.  Thanks again."
52,"MR. GREGORY:  And up next, the future of the Republican Party and the man some say will make a run for the White House in 2012.  Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty is here live for an exclusive interview."
53,"Plus, our roundtable weighs in on why Washington can't seem to get anything done.  It's only on MEET THE PRESS."
54,(Announcements)
55,MR. GREGORY:  Our exclusive interview with potential 2012 presidential contender and Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty on the future of the Republican Party right after this brief commercial break.
56,(Announcements)
57,"MR. GREGORY:  And we're back.  He has spent the past seven years as Minnesota's governor, introducing a long list of conservative initiatives, but many of those, including a constitutional amendment to cap state spending and an effort to reinstate the death penalty did not come to fruition.  In 2008 he was on John McCain's vice presidential short list, and now he is considered a potential presidential contender in 2012.  He made what some considered his national debut of sorts at this week's CPAC convention, a gathering of conservatives here in Washington."
58,"GOV. TIM PAWLENTY (R-MN):  I have a message for President Obama, and my message is this:  Mr. President, no more apology tours and no more giving Miranda rights to terrorists in our country."
59,"MR. GREGORY:  And he joins us now.
Welcome, Governor Tim Pawlenty, to MEET THE PRESS."
60,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Good to be with you, David."
61,"MR. GREGORY:  At that gathering of conservatives this week in Washington, Vice President Cheney said that he considers President Obama a one-term president.  Do you agree with that?"
62,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Well, I sure hope so.  You know, you never know.  I think the statistics on that is when you have a president who has been elected after the other party was in power, they tend to get re-elected, but I think the forces that are at work now favor the Republicans and conservatives very obviously."
63,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think that the Republicans stand to gain the majority again in Congress this fall?
64,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Well, it looks good.  We don't want to be, you know, projecting ahead and taking things for granted.  But, obviously, the country is saying, through Massachusetts and all the elections since the president's been in office, this isn't what we bargained for, this is a destination that we weren't planning on going, it's overreach by the federal government.  And the American people are saying, in Massachusetts and across the country, ""Enough."" So I think the Republicans are going to do well in 2010.  But anyone who tells you they can tell you with certainty what's going to happen in 2012, people really don't know that far ahead."
65,"MR. GREGORY:  You've actually been critical of the Republican Party, and you gave an interview this week to Esquire magazine.  Here's a portion of it, I'll put it on the screen.  ""The Republicans had their shot not long ago to address the real needs and concerns of everyday Americans, and they blew it.  ... Over the time that they were there and had the leadership opportunity, they blew it.  We got fired for a reason."" So what makes you think that the Republican Party has turned itself around?"
66,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  As I travel the country, I talk to Republicans, I talk to conservatives.  Everybody acknowledges we've learned our lesson.  And if we are given the privilege and the opportunity to govern again and to lead again, I think everyone's committed to learning from those lessons and doing it right.  You know, the last eight years when Republicans were in charge, the spending was not where it should have been.  We had a number of opportunities to change that and they--it didn't happen.  And also, when you look at the real problems of this country, these are serious times with serious challenges.  There is a Republican or conservative approach to fixing the healthcare system.  It's needed.  There is a conservative and Republican message on growing the economy, and it's needed.  And down the list.  So we need to be not just the party of saying, ""We hope President Obama continues to kick it in the dugout."" That's not a strategy, that's not a plan, that's not a vision for the future.  We also have to offer our own ideas and alternatives to solve and address these needs."
67,MR. GREGORY:  You've talked about running for president.  You're exploring that.  When will you make a decision?
68,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Well, I don't know what I'm going to do after I'm done being governor; but, as to my future, I'll probably sketch that out and decide that in early 2011."
69,MR. GREGORY:  And what will go into that?  Under what circumstances would you not decide to run?
70,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Well, I haven't decided to or not, David.  But what I'm going to do is use 2010 to help the cause, try to help candidates who have similar views and values as I do.  So I've started a PAC, and I'm traveling and speaking to these issues as time allows.  But, as to the future, I don't know. We'll see what that holds."
71,"MR. GREGORY:  You have said that a lot of people don't know you around the country, and they're, they're beginning to learn your views, and you're, you're making high-profile appearances to become better know.  You spoke at this gathering of conservatives this past week, and one of the things you said raised some eyebrows.  You were comparing the federal government's performance to Tiger Woods and, and his troubles on the very day that he had a press conference.  This is what you had to say:"
72,"(Videotape, February 19, 2010)"
73,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Now, I think we can learn a lot from that situation.  Not from Tiger, but from his wife.  So she said, ""I've had enough."" She said, ""No more."" I think we should take a page out of her playbook and take a nine iron and smash the window out of the--big government in this country.  ...  We've had enough."
74,(End videotape)
75,"MR. GREGORY:  With that kind of rallying cry, do you really expect people to take you seriously?"
76,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Well, I think people still enjoy a little sense of humor, and if we've gotten to the point where you can't make a joke, you know, I think we're in trouble.  But we do have serious problems, and I think the country is saying this isn't a matter about just doing business as usual.  There is the, the verge of a great movement rising up in this country saying, you know, this is not a matter of being right or left, it's a matter of math.  The country is in a position where we are precariously close to not being able to meet our obligations.  We're borrowing massive amounts of money from China, from sovereign wealth funds.  It weakens our country.  And when they own our debt, they also own parts of us in other ways, as Peggy Noonan wrote this morning in her great article."
77,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let's talk about some of the ways that you would lead the party and the country.  First of all, on economic recovery, do you think the worst of the economic crisis is over?"
78,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Well, I think we, we are going to see a stabilization of the economy for a while.  But I worry, David, greatly, that in 2011 and 2012, if the private economy doesn't start to pick up, you're going to see the possibility of this double dipping.  I hope that doesn't happen, but I don't guarantee or assure that the worst is over.  I think there's still a possibility of a double dip."
79,MR. GREGORY:  What about the stimulus program?  Do you think it worked?
80,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Well, you know, if definition of the stimulus program is, ""We're going to take a dollar from you in the private sector, bring it into government, spin it around, take five to 20 percent for overhead, and redeploy it into the private economy and call that growth."" Economists call that transfer effects.  So we need to be about real growth.  We need to be growing the private economy.  The stimulus bill was outsourced by this president to the United States Congress.  It came back in an incoherent fashion.  We could have gotten much more bang for the buck for much less money if they would have focused on those things that would have targeted at growing small businesses and growing jobs.  For example, cutting the payroll tax.  It was an incoherent, large, largely waste of money that is now sustaining government at a time when we need to be shrinking government."
81,MR. GREGORY:  But my question is do you think it worked?
82,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  As measured by the administration's own goals and objectives, no."
83,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
84,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  You know, they said they were going to..."
85,"MR. GREGORY:  What about the 12,000 jobs that were created in your state as a result of it?"
86,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Well, these are mostly government jobs, you know.  So what we're doing is..."
87,MR. GREGORY:  So you didn't need those?
88,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Well, we appreciate every job.  But the idea that government grows the economy when all they really do is extract money from taxpayers, bring it into the bureaucracy and put it back out into the economy on a political agenda is not growth, that's transferring money."
89,MR. GREGORY:  But would the economy have been in worse shape without the stimulus?
90,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Well, they said if they didn't pass the stimulus bill, unemployment could go as high as 8 percent.  It went to 10 percent.  They promised four million jobs at one point, created or saved.  You know the math around that is fuzzy, everybody agrees on that, and they have failed on that objective as well.  The economy and government is going to need to focus on growing the private sector, and what the stimulus bill mostly did is sustain government."
91,"MR. GREGORY:  But you don't disagree with economists, including an economist who advised the McCain campaign, which you vouched for and could have been on the ticket of, which has said, indeed, you know, there is somewhere around two million jobs that have been created by the stimulus, that it could have been a lot worse without it?"
92,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  David, I don't disagree that we need to do things to stimulate and grow the economy.  But the way to do that is to take the tax code and extend the Bush tax cuts, cut the payroll tax, encourage growth in the private economy by reducing capital gains burdens.  Don't put more burdens on the economy like this grotesque healthcare bill, bill.  Don't put on cap and trade legislation.  Don't do card check.  The--so the stimulus bill as a concept, you know, stimulating the economy is a good idea, but they did it the wrong way.  They should have done it through things that would stimulate private sector growth."
93,"MR. GREGORY:  We've got a huge deficit, $1.4 trillion.  You've talked about spending caps as you talk about dealing with a deficit like that.  Let's look at your own record in Minnesota, balancing the budget.  This is what your hometown paper said in Minneapolis about your efforts to deal with the budget. ""Governor Pawlenty's budget is bad news for low-income Minnesotans who rely on state health care and for mayors already struggling to balance their own budgets, but good news for corporations paying high taxes."" Is that your vision for America?  Social service cuts, but lower taxes on businesses?"
94,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  My vision for America is people have jobs.  And the way that you create jobs in this country is get businesses who provide the jobs to have--make it more likely that they're going to start a business, grow a business, buy equipment, build buildings, conduct research, commercialize the results of that research and grow jobs; hopefully, in my state, but all across this country.  So we need to do those things that are going to make Minnesota and the whole country more pro-jobs and more competitive."
95,"MR. GREGORY:  So what's the priority, jobs or deficit reduction?"
96,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Well, they go hand in hand.  If you grow the economy and you have the opportunity to grow revenues, that will help with the deficit, both in my state and nationally.  Now, that's not going to solve it."
97,MR. GREGORY:  So what would you cut in the federal government today to bring the deficit under control?
98,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Well, I'd cut a lot of things.  But, you know, the fact of the matter is we're going to have to come to grips and tell the truth with government spending, particularly as it relates to entitlement programs.  But nondefense spending is going to have to be reduced.  David, in Minnesota..."
99,MR. GREGORY:  Wait a minute.  But the biggest drivers are the entitlement spending on the deficit.
100,GOV. PAWLENTY:  That's right.
101,"MR. GREGORY:  So would you be prepared to cut entitlement benefits, cut Medicare, raise the, the, the age for Social Security or cut benefits for Social Security?"
102,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Here's the math.  The federal government takes in $2.2 trillion a year revenues, all sources for all purposes.  Their total unfunded liabilities, including entitlements, including pensions, including the whole bill, is $65 trillion.  There is no way you can make that math work.  So the truth of the matter is, is we are going to have to reform entitlement programs.  I've done this in Minnesota, for example, with our bus drivers in the Twin Cities.  They had post-retiree health insurance benefits, and the premise was this, if we made a promise to you, we'll keep it.  We're not going to cut people off in terms of their pensions if we've made a promise to you. But for people who are new to the system, who are coming on, where we can fairly give them notice and fairly change expectations, the system's going to change.  And we did it."
103,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you just about a few issues, and I'll try to get you to give short answers here..."
104,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Yeah, sure."
105,MR. GREGORY:  ...so we can move through a few of them.  Is America winning the war on terror?
106,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Great progress has been made.  And I think if you look at the progress just in Afghanistan in the last month or so, if you look what's happened in Iraq over the last few years since the surge, great progress has been made.  I don't think we're at the point where we can say we have won, but I think you can say we've headed in the right direction and we're making progress."
107,MR. GREGORY:  Is climate change real?
108,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  The climate's obviously changing, David.  But the real question and the more interesting question is how much of that is manmade, how much of that is the result of natural causes and patterns?  And, of course, we've seen a lot of data manipulation and a lot of controversy or at least debate within the scientific community..."
109,"MR. GREGORY:  But three years ago you said, strongly, anybody who questions it is just not right."
110,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  There's no question the climate is changing.  But the more interesting question is how much of that is manmade vs. natural causes?  And the way that you address it is we should all be in favor of reducing pollution.  But we need to do that in ways that don't burden the economy.  Cap and trade, I think, would be a disaster in that regard.  And the real breakthrough here is transformative technologies, moving forward with nuclear, moving forward with the technologies that give us the batteries to move forward with fuel cell technology or, or hybrid technology for battery-powered cars.  And we also need to have an appreciation for clean coal."
111,"MR. GREGORY:  What about ""don't ask, don't tell""?  Should it be repealed?"
112,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  I support ""don't ask, don't tell."" And, you know anecdotally--I saw the general's comments in response to that.  Anecdotally, I know there's still a great number, a great portion of the military community that is concerned about that.  They believe ""don't ask, don't tell"" worked. If it's not broke, don't fix it--or if it's not, it's not in need of fixing, you don't need to repair it.  So I'd leave it alone."
113,MR. GREGORY:  What about healthcare reform?  Do you think it's necessary? And what would be your specific proposal?
114,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Well, healthcare reform is a great issue for this country. It's--the system we have is currently broken.  We need to fix it.  But the answer isn't to have the federal government take it over.  So there's a great opportunity for our country to do this in a way with consumers in charge and markets in charge.  The premise in Minnesota has been this, people spend money differently when some of it's their money.  We need to pay for performance, not volumes of procedures.  We do need medical malpractice reform.  We do need some limitations on pre-existing conditions.  We do need portability.  But what we don't need, what we don't need, David, is having the federal government take over this much of our economy and have them run our healthcare system.  They will goof it up just like they do almost everything else that they take over."
115,"MR. GREGORY:  Finally, a more personal question, I, I heard your remarks this week and something caught my attention.  You're an evangelical Christian.  And when you talked about the conservative movement, you said what comes first for you is that God is in charge.  Describe your relationship with God."
116,"GOV. PAWLENTY:  Well, the founders of this nation embraced, also, that same perspective.  They said that we were endowed by our creator by certain rights. We're not endowed by Washington, D.C., we're not endowed by the state government or the local government.  And so I believe that there is a divine power, I believe there is a God, that God is in charge.  And if it's good enough for the Founding Fathers of this country, it's good enough for me."
117,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Governor Tim Pawlenty, thank you very much."
118,GOV. PAWLENTY:  Thank you.
119,"MR. GREGORY:  Up next, Washington's gridlock.  Is the problem petty politics or a lack of leadership?  Our roundtable weighs in:  E.J. Dionne, Peggy Noonan, Republican Congressman Mike Pence and Democratic Congressman Chris Van Hollen, after this brief station break."
120,(Announcements)
121,"MR. GREGORY:  And we are back with our roundtable.  Joining us, the chairman of the House Republican Congress--Conference, rather, Congressman Mike Pence; and the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Congressman Chris Van Hollen; also, E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post; and Peggy Noonan of The Wall Street Journal.
Welcome to all of you.  So much to get to."
122,REP. MIKE PENCE (R-IN):  Thank you.
123,"MR. GREGORY:  Here's a couple of magazine covers that caught our attention this week.  Time magazine, ""Why Washington Is Frozen,"" and it's not just about the snow, which still causes us great trouble.  Or The Economist magazine which is, ""What's Gone Wrong In Washington?""
Evan Bayh, senator from Indiana, surprisingly decided he would not run for re-election this week.  And here's what he said during one of his interviews. ""I've indicated to you and others, there's just too much brain-dead partisanship, tactical maneuvering for short-term political advantage rather than focusing on the greater good and, also, just strident ideology.
""The extremes of both parties have to be willing to accept compromises from time to time to make some progress because some progress for the American people is better than nothing.  And all too often, recently, we've been getting nothing."" Congressmen, a little constructive engagement here, beyond the partisanship. What is going on?"
124,"REP. PENCE:  Well, I think what Evan Bayh was talking about was a Democratic Congress, and I agree with him very strongly that, under Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate, Congress has been failing the American people.  The American people are tired of the borrowing, the spending, the bailouts, the takeovers.  But they're also, David, I think tired of the, of the, the really ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach the Democrats have taken.  I mean, it's unthinkable that a massive healthcare bill, a massive energy bill was actually brought to the floor and the minority party was allowed one amendment on those bills.  I think people are tired of the backroom deals, I think they're tired of the leadership the Democrats have brought to Capitol Hill, and I think that's why, as Tim Pawlenty said, I honestly believe the American people are going to take back the American Congress and put Republicans back in control this fall."
125,"REP. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD):  David, let's just flash back for a moment. The first nine months of the Obama administration, one of the most productive periods in recent legislative history, according to all independent outside observers.  We passed an expansive children's health care, paid for; we provided the opportunity for women to have their day in court on equal pay; we gave the FDA authority to protect our kids from tobacco use; we passed a very important public lands protection bill.  We passed a credit card billholders bill of rights.  We passed a whole lot of things.  Then we came to the healthcare debate.  Senator DeMint famously said, ""We're going to use this to break the president.  It's going to be his Waterloo."" Just last week we had seven Republican senators, who had their names on a bill to create a deficit reduction commission, vote against it for purely partisan reasons.  There's been a calculation by the Republican leadership that getting nothing done, to try and prevent the majority from working its will, as it did for the first nine months, is to their political advantage.  And there's no other explanation for that vote we saw.
REP. PENCE:  There's..."
126,"MR. GREGORY:  And here's, here's part of the problem, though."
127,REP. PENCE:  ...been no calculation like that.
128,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me, let me turn it to this side of the table, and I want to frame it this way.  You know, a lot of people will look at this back and forth and say, again, ""Nobody can agree."" Two different versions of that.  John Podesta, who was the chief of staff to Bill Clinton, of course, and advises this administration, said this during an interview with the Financial Times this week.  He said, ""I think the president is trying to re-engage with Republicans, but, quite frankly, he's not dealing with the party of [Abraham] Lincoln.  He's dealing with the party of [Sarah] Palin."""
129,"On the other side, The Economist magazine write this in its issue this week. ""It's not so much that America is ungovernable, as that Mr. Obama has done a lousy job of winning over Republicans and independents to the causes he favors.  ...Once President Clinton learned the advantage of co-operating with the Republicans, the country was governed better.""
Where are we, E.J.?"
130,"MR. E.J. DIONNE:  You know, I thought it was very revealing this weekend that in that CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Poll, who won.  It was Ron Paul, the Libertarian, with 31 percent.  By the way, Mike Pence and Tim Pawlenty were very close to Sarah Palin, so they deserve as much TV time as Sarah Palin gets.  But, you know, this is--the--Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff of the president, likes to say, ""The small government wing of the Republican Party is shrinking and the no-government wing of the Republican Party is growing."" You do not have a Republican Party anymore that had moderates in it willing to work with Democrats.  Now, that's OK if that's their position.  It's a more conservative party.  What we've got now is a parliamentary system without the structure of parliamentary government.  In parliamentary systems, the majority passes things, the opposition opposes, then there's an election and people decide.  Our--the kind of politics we have doesn't match the structure we have, and we got to bring the two together or else we're going to continue to have gridlock, as you heard these two gentlemen.  They disagree, fundamentally.  That's what's happening."
131,MS. PEGGY NOONAN:  Well...
132,"MR. GREGORY:  And--but here's--one of the big questions that came up this week is what is--do Americans listen to these two congressmen and say, ""This is petty politics,"" or do they say, ""This is sincere ideological division. What you really need is better leadership in Washington to cut through all of that."""
133,"MS. NOONAN:  Well, I think it probably would have helped if the president, when he came in so strong having won by 9.5 million votes just more than a year ago, if he had come forward with more centrist ideas and very bravely reached out to Republicans, even to the point of alienating or frightening or putting off a little bit of his base.  I think that didn't happen.  Overall, though, I think Washington is not broken.  Bipartisanship is very possible, but we see too much bipartisanship in terms of passing bad things.  There's always--the bastion of unity in Washington is the Appropriations Committee, also.  They're always coming together to spend.  Other issues that are not so easy spending have less unity.  And, look, overall we need more seriousness. Both parties have to remember they are here during a crisis, an ongoing crisis for serious reasons.  They all get together, the Republican conference and the Democratic conference, once a week for lunch, and I know from people who are at those lunches that they spend 98 percent of the time talking about how to trip up the other guy and 2 percent of the time on policy."
134,"REP. PENCE:  David, that's right, though.  We do need more seriousness in Washington, D.C.  This economy's struggling, we have challenges abroad.  This is a very serious time in the life of this nation.  But the, the reality is, and I think Peggy reflected on this, is that, you know, what's passed for bipartisanship in this Democratic Congress and under this administration is giving Republicans an opportunity to vote on big government, liberal Democrat bills.  That's not bipartisanship.  The president yesterday called for us to, to look for common ground.  He's challenging Republicans to present a, a bill at this so-called summit that's going to take place on Thursday, all the while Democrats are in some backroom, as we speak, cooking up another healthcare bill..."
135,MR. GREGORY:  But before we get to health care...
136,REP. PENCE:  ...that they're going to reveal next week.
137,MR. GREGORY:  ...you say big government bill.  The stimulus bill had $288 billion worth of tax cuts.  That was for you guys.
138,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Dave...
139,"REP. PENCE:  Well the stimulus bill, as I told the president, the stimulus bill that he brought to the floor did not include one single Republican proposal that had been offered on the floor.  We were completely--we were completely excluded from the process..."
140,MR. GREGORY:  Two hundred and eighty-eight dollars of tax...
141,REP. PENCE:  ...David.  And the stimulus bill has failed.
142,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Let, let me respond to that.  It did include one-third tax cuts, including bonus depreciation and many small tax cuts that the Republicans had proposed.  Mike, the other day in Baltimore at the Republican conference, referred to the tax cuts that went to 95 percent of working Americans as, ""boutique tax cuts,"" and then turned to the president and said, ""Why aren't you going to do across the board tax cuts?"" Meaning, ""How about the 5 percent of the wealthiest who were left out?"" What you're seeing, and I actually appreciate the fact that the Republicans have now said they're not the party of ""no"" and they're putting their ideas on the table, because what you're finding out is what their proposals are, are warmed-over Bush economic policies, including a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans.  So we welcome what is now clearly a debate on the issues."
143,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, what, what, what about health care, E.J. at this point? There is going to be this summit meeting live on TV.  Is there a chance here it's revived?"
144,"MR. DIONNE:  I think there's a good chance it's revived, but it's--I, I doubt it is going to be a bipartisan bill.  I mean, you have the Republicans who fundamentally disagree with the government playing a substantial role here. If the Republicans had really wanted to do this, they could have done it when they had the majority and President Bush was in office.  I think what is going to be useful about this is that people are going to look and say, instead of saying ""What's wrong with these various Democratic proposals,"" they'll have a chance to say, ""Here are the problems we're trying to solve.  Here's what the Democrats are--want to do, and here is what the Republicans propose.  Whose ideas match up here?"" I think, in the end, what the president is really trying to do is give heart to Democrats to say, ""I've reached out to Republicans, we'll see what we do.  We're going to point out ideas like--good ideas like letting kids stay on their parents health insurance until they're 26,"" which is in the Republican bill.  It's also in the Democratic bill.  And if they don't want to play with us, we still have to act.  I think the worst thing for Democrats to do would be to walk away from this, because they got all the bad votes, so-called, on these bills--Republicans say they're bad votes--and they produced nothing.  That gives nothing to anybody, and they look gutless.  So I think they've got to pass a bill."
145,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
146,"MS. NOONAN:  Quickly, it, it--if what is produced after the big Thursday meeting is an--a comprehensive omnibus bill of 1,000 or 2,000 pages it's not going to work again.  The past year, I think, has told us two things.  One is that this omnibus comprehensive stuff is yesterday, it's over, the public doesn't trust it.  If you can break health care down to proposals, agendas and then a few pieces of the agenda, say ""This small thing, can you do it?"" Republicans and Democrats might be able to do some business."
147,MR. DIONNE:  You know what the problem--could I just say quickly...
148,"MR. GREGORY:  But E.J., E.J's--but, but..."
149,MS. NOONAN:  Republicans and Democrats might be able to do some business that way.
150,MR. GREGORY:  But E.J....
151,"MS. NOONAN:  They will not trust this 2,000-page thing.  They also don't trust the tinkering in stimulus bills where you can always claim, ""We have 475 tax cuts."" Nobody ever sees those tax cuts."
152,"MR. DIONNE:  But if you can't tinker and you can't do a comprehensive bill, what do you do?"
153,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
154,MS. NOONAN:  Break it all down.
155,"REP. PENCE:  But E.J.'s, E.J.'s, E.J.'s talking about a--E.J.'s talking about kind of an idyllic..."
156,MS. NOONAN:  Do it small and simple and clear.
157,"REP. PENCE:  E.J.'s talking about kind of an idyllic approach to this summit. And quite frankly--let me be clear on this, and I'll say this with Chris in the room.  House Republicans would welcome a good faith effort to start over on healthcare reform.  We've had our bill online for months.  We welcome--the Democrats are going to put their latest bill online tomorrow.  If, if we were talking about really starting over with a clean piece of paper, scrapping the bills that have passed the House and the Senate, and also renouncing the abuse of the legislative process known as reconciliation, Republicans are ready to work.  But what we can't help but feel like here is the Democrats spell summit S-E-T-U-P.  And all this is going to be is some media event..."
158,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Come on, Mike.  Come on, Mike."
159,"REP. PENCE:  ...used as a preamble to shove through Obama care 2.0, and we're not going to have any of that."
160,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Come on, come on, Mike.  The status quo is broken.  We've seen in the last three weeks huge increases in premiums.  In Anthem health insurance out in California, 39 percent.  In Mike's state of Indiana, 25 percent average increases.  We need to address this issue.  Now, when the president gave his speech on health care back in September to a joint session and he said we need to prohibit health insurance companies from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions, both sides of the aisle got up, both sides were clapping."
161,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
162,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  But the Republican plan that Mike is talking about, he said, ""Go look at it,"" it doesn't prohibit insurance companies from discriminating based on pre-existing conditions."
163,REP. PENCE:  But we provide...
164,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  You...
165,"MR. GREGORY:  Hold on.  I want, I want to get in here..."
166,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  You have to bring in these people.  You can't...
167,MR. GREGORY:  ...because we've just got a couple minutes left.  Finish your point.
168,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  But, but, but, you know, you have to have the comprehensive piece.  Senator Grassley, way back, said we need everybody into the pool before he dropped that idea when he said he wasn't going to work in a bipartisan fashion."
169,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Let me move from policy to policy.  I just want--a couple of minutes left, and I want to, I want to get you on the record on the midterm election.  Congressman Van Hollen, back in October, this is what you said about the prospect of losing the House.  ""Anyone talking about a Republican takeover of the House is in la-la land."" Would you like to revise those remarks now?"
170,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  No.  I don't--I think it's--I've, I've always said, David, way back a year ago, in fact, right after the election of Barack Obama, this was going to be a very tough political cycle.  But this idea that they are going to be popping the champagne corks prematurely and measuring the drapes, I think is clearly--they are, they are high on their own hype these days."
171,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman Pence, you spoke at the, the gathering of conservatives this week.  Dick Armey spoke there as well, then the leader of this tea party movement.  Is the tea party movement, an--as an anti-government movement, is it part of the Republican Party?"
172,"REP. PENCE:  Well, I don't know.  You know, E.J. did that anti-government thing.  Look, and the president said this week, he said something about, ""You've got these people who are against government,"" you know.  In..."
173,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, they're not pro-government, that's fair, right?"
174,"REP. PENCE:  Right, no.  The American people aren't against government, they're against big government.  They're, they're tired of borrowing and spending and bailouts and takeovers.  And the people that you characterize..."
175,"MR. GREGORY:  But my question is about are they part of the Republican Party, do you believe?"
176,"REP. PENCE:  The people that you characterize, the tea party movement, are a group of--I was there at 9/12 on the National Mall.  I've spoken to tea party rallies and town hall meetings.  David, I'm telling you, these are decent, God-fearing, hard-working, everyday Americans..."
177,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
178,REP. PENCE:  ...who just know we can't pile this mountain range of debt on our children and grandchildren.
179,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think they're part of the Republican Party?
180,"REP. PENCE:  Well, I think that all depends on the Republican Party.  I think if we hold the banner of limited government high, of fiscal responsibility and personal responsibility, if we offer positive solutions and if we provide the loyal opposition to the big government schemes on energy and health care and budgets and deficits, you bet.  They'll know what to do this fall, and Republicans will win back the majority of the House in 2010."
181,"MR. GREGORY:  E.J., how do you see the political landscape on both the House and the Senate side?  Evan Bayh out now, another prospect where Republicans could look to take over the seat."
182,"MR. DIONNE:  Well, you know, Congressman Van Hollen is the head of the Democratic committee trying to keep the Congress Democratic.  He's got expectations for Democrats right where he wants them right now because everybody thinks they're going to lose the House.  I think if the election were held now, it would be a very tough election for Democrats.  They would lose a lot of seats.  I think--they lost two of the big debates in terms of public opinion.  The stimulus actually worked in many ways, but the Republicans have succeeded in persuading people it didn't.  Health care, clearly, that debate's in the wrong place for Democrats.  They've got eight months to fix it.  I don't think what, what happened today is going to happen in November.  I think they have a chance to fix it."
183,MR. GREGORY:  We have to leave it there.  So much more to discuss.
184,MS. NOONAN:  Oh!
185,MR. GREGORY:  I'm sorry.  I thank you all.  Thank you all.
186,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  All right.
187,"MR. GREGORY:  But before we go, we remember General Alexander Haig, who died Friday at the age of 85.  He served under two Republican presidents:  as chief of staff to President Nixon, and secretary of state to President Reagan.  Over the course of his career, General Haig appeared right here on MEET THE PRESS five times.  His family is in our thoughts and prayers this morning.  And we'll be right back."
188,(Announcements)
189,"MR. GREGORY:  That is all for today.  We will be back next week to discuss the president's healthcare summit and get Republican reaction from Senator John McCain of Arizona, our guest next week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday:  the healthcare divide.
    "
1,(Videotape)
2,SEN. LAMAR ALEXANDER (R-TN):  We ought to start over.
3,(End videotape)
4,(Videotape)
5,SEN. MAX BAUCUS (D-MT):  We are actually quite close.
6,(End videotape)
7,MR. GREGORY:  Is there room for compromise or will the made-for-TV summit result in stalemate?
8,(Videotape)
9,PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  We're not campaigning anymore.  The election's over.
10,"SEN. JOHN McCAIN (R-AZ):  I, I, I--I'm reminded of that every day."
11,"PRES. OBAMA:  The--oh--well, I..."
12,(End videotape)
13,"MR. GREGORY:  We'll ask our exclusive guests this morning, Arizona senator, Republican John McCain, and then White House healthcare czar, Nancy-Ann DeParle. "
14,"Plus, the politics of reform.  As the president makes one final push, what does the public really want from Washington?  And will success or failure on health care tip the scales in the 2010 midterm race?  Insights and analysis from our roundtable, three political insiders, House Republican whip, Congressman Eric Cantor of Virginia; president and CEO of the National Urban League Marc Morial; and House Democratic chief deputy whip Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.  Plus, two Washington journalists, the National Journal's Ron Brownstein and ""BBC World News America""'s Katty Kay. "
15,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  But first, Senator John McCain, welcome back to MEET
THE PRESS. "
16,"SEN. McCAIN:  Thanks for having me back, David."
17,"MR. GREGORY:  The healthcare summit on TV, much anticipated, it happened, many hours worth.  What's changed?"
18,"SEN. McCAIN:  Well, I think the American people are much better informed, and I think it was a good thing because I think there was an in-depth discussion with a lot of--about a lot of issues, and I'm glad that it happened.  And it gave--I think a lot of Americans watched.  I'm not sure not all seven hours, but I think that it was a good forum.  I think that the American people learned something.  And I hope that it could be the basis for us to have some serious negotiations.  But we still have the fundamental problem:  Do we go on the partisan plan that was rammed through the Senate and the House or do we start over from the beginning?  And we obviously--the--apparently the president may be intent, along with the speaker and the majority leader, to go the 51-vote route, which I'm sure we'll get into in our conversation."
19,"MR. GREGORY:  And, and that's called budget reconciliation where they could pass it with a simple majority.  How would you react if, indeed, that's what will happen?"
20,"SEN. McCAIN:  Throughout history, recent history anyway, the majority has always been frustrated by the 40-vote or the 60-vote threshold in the United States Senate.  And when Republicans are in the majority, they're frustrated by the Democrats and vice versa.  I did object strongly when, during the Bush administration, when we couldn't get any judges confirmed that there was the advocacy of the ""nuclear option."" I objected to that because I believed, as Robert Byrd does, that, that we should not be addressing these issues through 51 votes. "
21,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator, you have voted for bills through reconciliation nine times since 1989."
22,"SEN. McCAIN:  Yes.  Yes, I have voted for them, but I objected strenuously to us changing the rules so the Senate--so that 51 votes would prevail.  And let me also say that Robert Byrd also in the '70s exempted Social Security. Social Security cannot be considered in reconciliation.  We should do the same thing with Medicare.  Lindsey Graham and I will be introducing legislation. Entitlements should not be part of a reconciliation process, i.e., 51 votes. It's too important."
23,MR. GREGORY:  You...
24,SEN. McCAIN:  One-sixth of our gross national product.
25,MR. GREGORY:  You were critical of how this bill came to be.
26,SEN. McCAIN:  Yes.
27,MR. GREGORY:  Some of the deals that were made.  You talked about that during your--the speech during this summit.  And you had this notable exchange that we played a portion of during the open to the program.  Let me show it to you.
28,SEN. McCAIN:  Mm-hmm.
29,(Videotape)
30,"PRES. OBAMA:  Let me just make this point, John, because we're not campaigning anymore.  The election's over."
31,"SEN. McCAIN:  I, I, I--I'm reminded of that every day."
32,"PRES. OBAMA:  The--oh--well, I..."
33,(End videotape)
34,MR. GREGORY:  What was your reaction to that moment?
35,"SEN. McCAIN:  Well, look, the president said that the, the campaign is over. What I was saying to the president is that you--the mistake that has been made is assuming that with 60 votes in the Senate and overwhelming majority in the House, you can move legislation through which has to be bipartisan in nature. It has to be.  Every major reform has had bipartisan support.  And so what they ended up with is, in order to buy votes, they did these unsavory deals. They are unsavory.  To say that 800,000 people in Florida will be carved out from any reduction in a
Medicare Advantage program--330,000 of my citizens in Arizona are Medicare Advantage enrollees.  To, to say that you're going to put $100 million in for a hospital in Connecticut?  Look, these are unsavory deals.  They were done behind closed doors, and it has been--look, I'd have town hall meetings all over the place in my state of Arizona. People object to the process as much as they do to the product. "
36,"MR. GREGORY:  But, you know, Senator, the president..."
37,SEN. McCAIN:  And policy cannot be made through an unsavory vote-buying process.
38,"MR. GREGORY:  But the president has said that there were negotiations with Republicans.  For months ground was lost through a negotiation on the Finance Committee with Republicans that didn't come to pass.  And you say this is not a bipartisan bill, and yet Ron Brownstein, who will be on the program, the columnist makes clear in a column on Friday, this has all the similarities of the Dole proposal in 1993 to Romney's proposal..."
39,SEN. McCAIN:  Mm-hmm.
40,MR. GREGORY:  ...that was passed for healthcare reform in Massachusetts. How is this a partisan bill?
41,"SEN. McCAIN:  I have been part of bipartisan negotiations for many, many years, and I have a record of bipartisan results.  This was not bipartisan. The way you have bipartisan negotiations, you sit down across the table, as we did with Ted Kennedy, as I've done with many other members, and you say, ""OK, here's what I want, here's what you want. We'll adhere to your principles, but we'll make concessions."" This bill was written by Democrats, for Democrats, and then they tried--and I understand power--what they tried to do was peel off a couple of Republicans, as he did with the stimulus bill, and call it bipartisan. It's not bipartisan.  I know bipartisanship, and with all due respect to any of our other observer, let's start over, then.  It's not too late."
42,MR. GREGORY:  Is there one thing...
43,"SEN. McCAIN:  It's not too late.  Why don't we sit down together and say, ""OK, let's start with medical malpractice reform""?  We agree, I think, fundamentally on that.  Why don't we address going across state lines? Why don't we go across many of the positive proposals that we Republicans have had, too, and maybe we can find common ground? "
44,MR. GREGORY:  Final point on health care.
45,SEN. McCAIN:  Sure
46,MR. GREGORY:  The politics of this is something that will be much discussed in this election year.
47,SEN. McCAIN:  Yes.
48,"MR. GREGORY:  Whether success or failure, hurts or helps, Democrats and Republicans for the midterm race.  Well, we've been here before, back in 1994 when President Clinton tried this.  And you've been here before talking about this very issue.  Back in 1994, Tim Russert asked you about the political implications.  I want to play that for you."
49,"(Videotape, July 10, 1994)"
50,"MR. TIM RUSSERT:  Politically, is it better for the Republicans in the congressional elections to have healthcare reform bill or not to have that bill? "
51,"SEN. McCAIN:  If the Republicans can convince the American people they are doing it to prevent something like the catastrophic health insurance bill of the late '80s, then yes.  But if we are viewed, as the Democrats will attempt to portray us, as just obstructing people from getting the health which they need, then we do so at great risk."
52,(End videotape)
53,MR. GREGORY:  So same question now.
54,SEN. McCAIN:  I was certainly better-looking in those days.  Let...
55,MR. GREGORY:  Same question now:  Better for Republicans to have a bill or have no bill?
56,"SEN. McCAIN:  I don't know, but I know what's happened with American public opinion, and that is also--seems to be missing in the, the calculations of the president and the Democrats.  Overwhelmingly, the American people, depending on which poll you look at, but overwhelmingly,
American people are saying stop and start over.  We realize you can't do nothing.  That, that's just a straw man.  We know that Medicare's going broke in seven years, but we need to start over.  That's what the American people want us to do.  And, again, I get back--they don't like
these cynical deals.  They are cynical about us.  They don't trust us. When you have these deals, these unsavory deals, to the pharmaceutical companies.  David, how can we say to the pharmaceutical companies, ""We'll let you have breaks such as not competing for Medicare pay--enrollees, such as banning the import--reimportation of drugs from Canada in return for which you'll run $100 million or such touting the administration's healthcare reform plan""? That's not right.  Americans see through it."
57,MR. GREGORY:  More on the politics of 2010.
58,SEN. McCAIN:  All right.
59,"MR. GREGORY:  You are in a, a primary battle for re-election against former Republican Congressman J.D. Hayworth of Arizona.  And on the issue of health care, this is what he says on his Web site, on the issues, ""Nowhere is the Obama administration's socialist agenda more evident than  in their attempts to grab control over 17 percent of our nation's economy."" Socialist agenda, do you think that goes too far?"
60,"SEN. McCAIN:  Look, you'll have to have Mr. Hayworth on to explain the things he says."
61,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
62,"SEN. McCAIN:  I'm, I'm not ready to do that."
63,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think that goes too far?
64,"SEN. McCAIN:  Oh, well..."
65,MR. GREGORY:  That this is a socialist agenda from the president?
66,"SEN. McCAIN:  Look, look, there is no doubt in my mind America's a right-of-center nation and this administration is governing from the left. That's why the president's approval rating's continued to, to decline.  And I know you want to get off health care, and I will.  But I want to say again--and Eric Cantor who's coming on later will affirm this--we want to sit down and have negotiations, and we have a positive agenda, and we would love to see that agenda..."
67,"MR. GREGORY:  But--OK, but..."
68,SEN. McCAIN:  Yes.
69,"MR. GREGORY:  ...my question is do you think that kind of--because you've heard that description before, not just from J.D. Hayworth but others. Does it go too far to say the president's agenda is a socialist agenda?"
70,"SEN. McCAIN:  I, I think I gave my description.  I think they're governing from the left on a broad variety of issues, but I'll let others speak for themselves.  I, I have enough time taking care of my own misstatements."
71,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let's talk about, you--you've been criticized by some who say because you're in a primary battle that you've changed a little bit, that you've taken more conservative positions.  And they go through some particular issues.  Let me bring up a couple.  One has to do with the..."
72,SEN. McCAIN:  Good.
73,"MR. GREGORY:  ...issue of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the prohibition against gays to serve in the military.  Back in 2006..."
74,SEN. McCAIN:  Mm-hmm.
75,"MR. GREGORY:  ...on MSNBC, this is what you said about your view.  ""The day that the leadership of the military comes to me and says Senator, we ought to change the policy, then I think we ought to consider seriously changing it because those leaders in the military are the ones we give the responsibility to."" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mike Mullen testified earlier this month, this is what he said:"
76,"(Videotape, February 2, 2010)"
77,ADM. MIKE MULLEN:  It is my personal belief that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would be the right thing to do.
78,(End videotape)
79,"MR. GREGORY:  And the head of CENTCOM, General David Petraeus, who was on
MEET THE PRESS just this past Sunday, said this."
80,"(Videotape, Last Sunday)"
81,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think soldiers on the ground in the field care one way or the other if their comrade in arms are gay or lesbian?
82,GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS:  I'm not sure that they do.
83,(End videotape)
84,"MR. GREGORY:  Why doesn't that meet your standard of 2006 for you to say, ""OK, it's time to change views""?"
85,"SEN. McCAIN:  Because, as I said back then, that we need to have a careful examination, and Admiral Mullen was, as quote, ""speaking personally."" Just this week, commandant of the Marine Corps said that he did not want ""don't ask, don't tell"" repealed.  There are many in the military who do not want to. We are going to go through, hopefully, a yearlong study that will hopefully also have the feelings of the men and women who are serving.  But, David, what--also the chief of staff of the Air Force and the chief of staff of the Army pointed out we're in two
wars.  We have the highest trained, most professional, best military in history.  We have the highest retention, highest recruitment in history. And they're all saying, ""Wait a minute. Before we change this, let's make sure we go through a careful examination, ranging from what you heard Admiral Mullen say, his ""personal opinion,"" to what the commandant of the Marine Corps said, he doesn't want it changed.  So it's clear that we need to do be very careful as to how we move forward on whether we change this policy or not."
86,MR. GREGORY:  But if the result of that study is that we should move beyond it...
87,SEN. McCAIN:  I believe that it's working.
88,"MR. GREGORY:  ...you would, you would side with that?"
89,"SEN. McCAIN:  If the result of that study is, is one that I can trust and believe in and is supported by our military leaders, obviously, I would have that--give that the most serious consideration."
90,"MR. GREGORY:  One question about the bailout, the TARP."
91,"SEN. McCAIN:  Oh, yeah."
92,"MR. GREGORY:  You voted for it, but you've said that you were misled by former Treasury Secretary Paulson.  How so?"
93,"SEN. McCAIN:  We were all misled.  We were all misled.  I mean, he said that they were going after the toxic assets.  The toxic asset--his word--was the housing market.  He testified to that.  I mean, we were all misled.  So what did he do then?  They started pumping money into the financial institutions. Now the financial institutions are fine.  Wall Street's doing great.  Main Street is in deep trouble.  In my home state of Arizona, 48 percent of the homes are under water.  In other words, they're worth less than the mortgage payments people are making.  The..."
94,"MR. GREGORY:  But he says without TARP, you'd have 25 percent unemployment. You would have had that."
95,"SEN. McCAIN:  He can--he said that, that they would be going after the toxic assets, which were the housing market.  And that's what his testimony was, that's what he pledged to do, and--to the American people and to the Congress. And they turned around--I mean, it's a matter of record, it's been reported in all the media.  They turned around and switched from trying to address the housing market to bailing out the financial institutions on Wall Street.  Who ever thought that we would, when we passed that, we would own General Motors and Chrysler, GMAC?  I mean, it's, it's, it's beyond what anyone had anticipated."
96,MR. GREGORY:  Final moment on foreign policy...
97,SEN. McCAIN:  Yeah.
98,"MR. GREGORY:  ...and I'll conflate Iraq and Afghanistan in one question. Here's the cover of Newsweek magazine this week.  ""Victory At Last:  The Emergence of a Democratic Iraq."" And as you follow the offensive that's taking place in southern Afghanistan to make strides toward shoring up the government in Afghanistan, do you think success along the lines of Iraq, if you believe it's a success..."
99,SEN. McCAIN:  Mm-hmm.
100,MR. GREGORY:  ...is possible in Afghanistan?
101,"SEN. McCAIN:  Oh, of course.  In fact, the Afghans do not want the Taliban back.  When the surge started in Iraq, things were in total chaos.  It--I think we have significant advantages in Afghanistan.  But, look, Iraq is not over.  I have--I appreciate that cover, but it's two steps forward and one step back.  These elections coming up are very important.  In Afghanistan, it's two steps forward and one step back. It's a long, hard process and..."
102,MR. GREGORY:  Can it be achieved in that 18-month time frame that the administration has put forward in Afghanistan.
103,"SEN. McCAIN:  Well, the thing that worries me the most is the president's statement about leaving in the middle of 2011.  I would appreciate it if the president told these, all the way down to Afghan tribal leaders who have questioned me about it, to say we're going to do what's necessary to succeed, period.  I would love to see that.  That's of great concern. They have to stay in the neighborhood.  And if we leave, they have to adjust.  But I am--I have great confidence in our leadership and the men and the women who are serving.  I have never been more proud. "
104,"MR. GREGORY:  We will leave it there.  Senator McCain, thank you, as always."
105,"SEN. McCAIN:  Thank you for having me on, David."
106,MR. GREGORY:  Appreciate it.
107,"Up next, the president's blueprint for healthcare reform.  What will we see in a final bill and how does the plan get there?  We'll speak with his healthcare czar, Nancy-Ann DeParle.  Plus, our roundtable weighs in on the politics of reform and the 2010 landscape, only here on MEET THE

110,(Announcements) 
111,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We're back, joined now by White House healthcare czar Nancy-Ann DeParle."
112,Welcome to MEET THE PRESS.
113,MS. NANCY-ANN DePARLE:  Thank you.
114,"MR. GREGORY:  This week during the healthcare summit The New York Times described it as a ""hail Mary pass, a last ditch effort for the president to keep his top legislative priority from slipping out of his grasp."" As you sit here today, do you have the votes to get this passed in Congress?"
115,"MS. DePARLE:  Well, David, what the president wanted to do is bring everybody together again, as he has before during this process, to really have an open and honest discussion about what's at stake here for the American people. What with people loving their coverage, with premiums sky rocketing, you know, how do we deal with these problems?  And I think
we achieved that this week. And..."
116,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you have the votes, though, in Congress to pass it?"
117,"MS. DePARLE:  What he wants to do, David, is to make sure that he's fighting for American families and businesses by doing something about this problem, to reduce their costs, to make it more accessible, to give them the kind of options and choices and protections that members of
Congress have.  And I believe..."
118,"MR. GREGORY:  OK.  But, but, but my question is, do you have the votes?"
119,"MS. DePARLE:  I believe that we will have the votes to pass this in
Congress."
120,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
121,MS. DePARLE:  I believe that the president will keeping fighting and that the American people want to have this kind of health reform.
122,MR. GREGORY:  But you don't have the votes yet?
123,"MS. DePARLE:  Well, look, the president will have more to say about that later this week, and he's working with the Congress on how best to address that."
124,"MR. GREGORY:  Has he made a decision, especially given the results of this summit, that you've got to move forward with reconciliation, just go for a simple majority and, you know, losing the opportunity to try to bring some Republicans along?"
125,"MS. DePARLE:  Well, look, he's going to have more to say later this week about how he thinks is the best way to move forward.  But I think what it's important to remember here is that we have some fundamental problems with our insurance markets.  We have insurance companies sending out premium increases of 39 percent out in California.  These are problems that need to be fixed, and the president hears every day from Americans who are hurting because of that."
126,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  OK.  But fixing those problems, you have to get through procedure to get there, and I've been told by several people the decision has been made.  It's reconciliation, go for the simple majority, or else the reforms you're talking about simple won't be possible."
127,"MS. DePARLE:  Well, I don't know about that, but I do know this, that healthcare reform has already passed both the House and the Senate with not only a majority in the Senate but a super majority, and we're not talking about changing any rules here.  All the president is talking
about is, do we need to address this problem and, and does it make sense to have a simple up or down vote on whether or not we want to fix these problems?"
128,"MR. GREGORY:  A lot of talk at the summit about where public opinion is. And, and here's one poll from CNN/Opinion Research about how Congress should proceed, a similar bill, a new bill, or stop working on the bill. Nearly three-quarters of the public saying either start over or stop
working.  I wonder if you respond to Senator McCain who says the ""unsavory deals,"" in his words, that were made by this administration with pharmaceutical companies, the insurance companies, really hurt the president's effort overall?"
129,"MS. DePARLE:  Well, first of all, I'm not sure what he's talking about with deals with insurance companies.  If you've watched your network or any others, you've seen a lot of the ads they're running to try to stop reform.  And I think we know why.  I think we know that right now insurance companies are making the rules and that's part of what the president's..."
130,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
131,MS. DePARLE:  ...trying to change.  So...
132,"MR. GREGORY:  But they did agree to more regulation and to allow people with previous, you know, prior conditions, because they'd get access to a wider of market of people who would be insured."
133,MS. DePARLE:  I don't know that they agreed to anything.
134,MR. GREGORY:  There was a deal with pharmaceutical companies.
135,MS. DePARLE:  I think...
136,MR. GREGORY:  There was a deal with the senator from Nebraska...
137,MS. DePARLE:  Well...
138,MR. GREGORY:  ...and deals for Louisiana and Florida's both with regard to Medicaid.
139,"MS. DePARLE:  And let's, let's, let's talk about that.  The, the Medicaid provisions in the president's proposal that he put out last week are not the same ones.  And, in fact, all states are treated the same with respect to Medicaid.  But the more important question, David, is are we going to move forward here or just start over?  What is that really code for?"
140,"Is that, is that just code for let's not do anything?  And I don't think that's what the American people want.  That's not the people that I'm hearing from every day."
141,"MR. GREGORY:  But where's the evidence--the, the president has said that Americans don't want to wait.  But you see the poll that I just showed, and I'm asking where, where's the evidence that Americans don't want to wait, that they really want to move forward?  The only protests you've seen publicly are on the right in opposition to the bill.  Is it a problem of apathy among those who support it or is it not really there?"
142,"MS. DePARLE:  No.  I think it's a problem partly of who has the power in this whole equation, and I think that's part of the president's fighting for is that, right now, the people that he hears from every day--I get notes from him about people that he's hearing from when he's there out talking to them and the letters he gets--who can't get insurance coverage because their child has a pre-existing condition.  They have asthma, they can't change jobs, their premiums are skyrocketing.  So I leave the polls to others.  What the problem he's asked me to work on is to try to get the best, most effective way we can to help Americans who are dealing with these problems."
143,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
144,MS. DePARLE:  The small business people who...
145,MR. GREGORY:  But you can't...
146,MS. DePARLE:  ...can't afford to keep providing coverage.
147,"MR. GREGORY:  But you can't separate the lack of public support for an effort as you move forward on, on the policy.  Can this be passed through Congress without support from the American people? "
148,"MS. DePARLE:  I think there is support.  I think when you talk to the American people about whether it's fair for them to get knocked off their coverage when they get sick, I think they agree that, no, we need some common sense rules..."
149,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
150,"MS. DePARLE:  ...to help regulate that market.  I think they agree with
that."
151,"MR. GREGORY:  One of the big selling points on this is that this would reduce cost over time and that it would be paid for, that it would actually lower the deficit.  But David Brooks, given--before I get to that, but the issue of a tax on those gold plated plans is a key way that
you pay for this and balance the costs down the line.  Well, that has been changed in the president's plan to take effect later.  This is what David Brooks writes in his column on Friday.  ""The Democrats (and the Republicans)"" at the summit, ""conveniently neglected to mention the fact that they had just gutted the long-term revenue source for their entire package, the excise tax on high-cost insurance plans. That tax was diluted and postponed until 2018.  There is no way that members of a Congress eight years from now are going to accede to a $1 trillion tax increase to pay for a measure that the 2010 Congress wasn't brave enough to pay for itself."""
152,"MS. DePARLE:  And by the way, David, that, that tax, that fee on high-cost insurance plans was designed to bring down pressure in the long term, and it does just that.  And that's why the economists across the spectrum who have looked at it say that's something that they want in this bill and they're glad that it's remained in there.  The, the president's fought for it."
153,MR. GREGORY:  But it's pushed back.
154,"MS. DePARLE:  It is, by the way, one of the Republican ideas."
155,MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But it's pushed back to 2018.
156,"MS. DePARLE:  It is, but it was also improved to make sure that it really does focus..."
157,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but the question that David Brooks is asking, you really think Congress down the road is going to pay for a tax increase that this Congress wasn't brave enough to pass now?"
158,"MS. DePARLE:  Yes, I do, because this president has--is paying for reform, unlike similar measures in the past, first of all.  And, secondly, it, it's something that over 10 years is going to reduce the deficit.  They're not going to walk away for that. "
159,"MR. GREGORY:  Final point, will incremental reform, will a smaller package still be considered reform by this president?"
160,"MS. DePARLE:  Well, this president's fighting to get the most effective package possible to help the American people to lower their costs, to get everyone covered.  And, unfortunately, these are big problems.  It's a fundamental problem that he's been left with here, and we have to deal with it.  We can't just walk away.  I think everyone agreed at the meeting on Thursday that we can't just do nothing.  Well, what does that mean?  That means we have to address these, these problems, and the baby steps that they talked about, some of which are worthy ideas, many of which we've spent hours talking to them about over the last year and we've incorporated in the bill, they just don't solve the problem.  I think that's the issue.  So whether we can solve those problems in a piecemeal fashion, I think, is a real challenge and the real issue here."
161,MR. GREGORY:  We will leave it there.  Thank you very much.
162,MS. DePARLE:  Thank you.

DAVID GREGORY:  And we are back.  Joining us, the National Urban League's Marc Morial; the House Republican whip, Congressman Eric Cantor of Virginia; and House Democratic chief deputy whip, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.  Plus, two Washington journalists, Ron Brownstein of the National Journal and Katty Kay of ""BBC World News America,"" plus two minor league round draft picks to be named later. "
166,Offscreen Voice #1:  Right.
167,Offscreen Voice #2:  Right.
168,MR. GREGORY:  We have our own healthcare summit here.  We have a big group. Welcome to everybody.
169,"Congressman Cantor, let me begin with you.  The big question is where are we after this summit, after all the machinations and negotiations?  Are there the votes in the House to get this done?"
170,"REP. ERIC CANTOR (R-VA):  Well, I'm sure my colleague will have something to say about that.  But, David, there's a reason why we're here with no healthcare bill having been passed and that's because the American people have decided this is not the healthcare bill for them.  And that's why you heard, during the seven-hour discussion that we had at the Blair House with the president, Republicans come to the table and say, ""Look, we do care about health care and we want to do something to effect positive reform."" It's just that we want to take a much more commonsense, modest, incremental approach trying to address the first issue first, which is cost, and then go on to try and deal with some of the things that the president and Speaker Pelosi want to do."
171,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We'll come back to that.  But--in terms of what the general approach is.
172,"But, Congresswoman Schultz, is there and are there the votes in the House, which is really the, the big testing ground here, if it's, if it's reconciliation, for instance, where you go for a simple majority.  Are the votes there?"
173,"REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL):  When we start counting, the votes will be there.  Because the American people want to make sure that we take the abusive practices that the insurance companies engage in and make sure that we put doctors and patients back in the driver's seat. Right now it's insurance companies that decide what kind of coverage you
have.  Right now it's insurance companies that can drop you based on a pre-existing condition.  I know that from personal experience.  Right now you can get dropped when you become sick.  You--we've got to make sure that we put doctors and patients, not insurance companies, back in the driver's seat.  And if you look at the polling, if we're going to talk about polling, that the American people have, have weighed in on, they support the components that are included in this bill because they want to make sure that we end abusive practices by insurance companies."
174,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Marc Morial, the--but the, the composite of all of those, the difficulty that the president faces is that he has not sold the public on his version of healthcare reform.  That's the reality of his situation right now.  I spoke to one very close ally of the president's on this fight, saying he thinks 40 percent chance this ultimately gets done.  Where are we?"
175,"MR. MARC MORIAL:  I think that there's a strong chance that it's going to happen because it needs to happen.  Because, beyond the politics of Washington and the infighting, the fact of the matter is there's a problem in this nation and that is there are many people uncovered, and
for those who do have coverage, costs are exploding.  So I think that the president rightfully went back and had a discussion, which was a healthcare summit.  Some may have said it didn't make good TV, but what it did is it showed that the discussions are substantive, that the
issues, in fact, are serious.  And I think, at the end, something should get done and something will get done because it needs to get done. "
176,"MR. GREGORY:  You know, it's interesting, Ron Brownstein, and our congressmen and women will talk about some of the philosophical differences, for all the talk of the petty politics, one thing that came through the summit..."
177,MR. RON BROWNSTEIN:  Right.
178,MR. GREGORY:  ...is that there are very big philosophical and ideological divisions about the role of government...
179,MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Yes.
180,"MR. GREGORY:  ...in the healthcare system and how many people should be covered, particularly given the finances during a recession."
181,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Absolutely.  I mean, I think one of the, the real points that came out of the summit was the depth of the disagreement between the parties.  And, in fact, each party's healthcare plan I think largely crystallizes their view of the, of the role of government.  And they differ not only in, in their solution to the problem but their definition of the problem.  I mean, we're not really, to use the president's term, comparing apples to apples.  The president's plan, the Democratic plan attempts to cover roughly, by the CBO estimate, 33 million people who are uninsured over the next decade.  The Republican plan, by the CBO
estimate, aims to cover three million people.  It is a much more minimalist plan.  It's basically recycling ideas--the association health plans, the interstate sale of insurance, the medical malpractice--that Republicans pushed and were unable to bring into law when they held
unified control of the House and the Senate and the White House in the middle part of this decade.  They were unable to build enough public consensus for those ideas when they had unified control to, to get them into law.  So--I mean, I think what we're seeing here--the, the reality is health care is a very difficult issue.  It has, it has defeated every president who has tried it for 70 years, it's a very complex problem. And, and what you're seeing, in the end, are fundamentally different divisions of the parties about how to attack this and, really, what even
you are attacking in the end."
182,"MR. GREGORY:  What about the president's leadership on this, Katty?"
183,"MS. KATTY KAY:  I don't think that the summit changed things either way in terms of the potential for passage or not passage of this reform bill. And I want--one area where I think the president hasn't managed to try to get those poll numbers to shift in favor of reform is to say to Americans, ""Listen, you may have a level of care at the moment that you're happy with, but if we carry on with these exploding costs, care will deteriorate."" At the moment, America has globally the 37th highest quality of care in the world.  That puts it just above Costa--just above Cuba, just below Costa Rica.  Now is that where America sees itself in terms of its quality of care?  And that number will decline.  It's going to slip down the global poll of where its level of health care is if something isn't done about healthcare reform.  And that's an argument that the president hasn't managed to get across.  I think the other thing he hasn't done is really appeal to an--a sense of generosity in the American people.  I travel around the country and I've seen the poll numbers, but I'm struck by how many Americans say to me, ""We don't see ourselves as a country that doesn't allow people access to a doctor if they don't have insurance."" That's, that's just not how Americans see themselves.  This is the country that gives the highest level of charitable donations in the world. Americans think of themselves as a different country than that."
184,"MR. GREGORY:  And, and yet--all of you can weigh in on this--the, the, the, the tension seems to be that individual elements are popular, you can talk to people who want better health care, better access to health care, reform.  But there's a lot of distrust that government can deliver this kind of care and handle it well.  And isn't that the fundamental tension?"
185,"MR. MORIAL:  But, but you know, David, the fundamental delivery system here will be the private insurance system.  That's what's key.  This is not the government running insurance.  It is changes to how health care is delivered. But what it would do would be to provide opportunities for more Americans to purchase private insurance.  And I think there's been a
great deal of confusion.  This is, in essence, a, a, a partnership between the government and the private sector to expand health coverage. And I think that it's been confused by talking points, it's been confused by political broadsides, but that's essentially what it is."
186,"REP. CANTOR:  David, the, the..."
187,MS. KAY:  David...
188,"REP. CANTOR:  ...the, the reality is, and take a little bit a different approach here and difference with that statement, the reality is Republicans do care about health care.  We want to address the first and most foundational element which is cost, because if we can bring down
costs, more people can  access care.  But we also know that there is something we need to do to get more people on insured.  The problem is with the president's bill, it's about expanding Medicaid.  No one wants to, to go onto Medicaid.  That's why physicians in Florida and other
states are leaving Medicaid in droves because of the imperfect reimbursement structure.  That's what this bill is about is expanding the government programs that don't work.  We need real reform to bring down costs."
189,"REP. SCHULTZ:  David, you want to talk about bringing down costs, our bill makes sure that we address the problem of every family in America having an--a $1,000 hidden tax for covering the uninsured.  There's 47 million people in America that don't have insurance, and we are all
paying for them because they show up at the emergency room as their primary access point for health care. In order to reduce costs, we can cut to a tax of $1,000 on American families just by covering those people.  We can also make sure that we bring down costs by broadening the pool, adding the healthiest people who are choosing right now to not, to 
not carry health insurance, and then when they get hit out of a clearblue sky by an unexpected illness, they don't have insurance and we're all paying for it.  We've got to make sure we take care of this."
190,"MR. GREGORY:  But let's reality-check this for a second, Ron.  The, the, the, the claim by Congressman Cantor that there isn't cost reduction here, we're not lowering costs, is that accurate?  Look what the CBO says about the effect on the deficit."
191,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Well, well, there, there are two ways to look at this. The CBO says that it would--the Democratic plan would reduce the deficit. Republicans believe that many of the changes in Medicare would not be implemented in the long run and call that into question.  The broader question of what it means to overall national healthcare spending has been analyzed by the Medicare actuary, which is an independent position. And what they concluded was that between now and 2019, if you did the Democratic plan, you would ensure 33 million more people and national health--total national health spending would increase by less than a
penny on the dollar.  So does it break the back of rising costs?  No. But does it reallocate resources within the medical system more efficiently potentially than they are now?  Clearly, the actuary is suggesting yes if you can cover 33 million more people at a total cost of
less than a penny on the dollar increase in our, in our total national health expenditures.  That is a part of the debate that has not, that has not come through.  Can I just go back to..."
192,MR. GREGORY:  Yes.
193,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  ...your point, though, very quickly, which was--you're absolutely right--even though individual elements of this plan do poll well, overall, Democrats have never been able to get it to a position where most Americans, particularly most white Americans--because there is a difference between minorities and whites in the polling--believe it will help them and their family.  That's why this is, I think, a real gut-check moment for these Democratic majorities.  I think if you poll them privately, clear majorities in both chambers would believe they have produced a plan that is a reasonable way to do universal--approach universal coverage if that is your goal.  The question is, do they believe they can sell it to the American people if they go forward with it?  Because, as you say, right now, they haven't, and Republicans, I think, exuded confidence at that summit that they believe they are winning this argument."
194,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, so--and so, Congresswoman, what happens between now  and the point at which you say you have the votes?  What is the president going to say this week?  How will he justify reconciliation going for a simple majority in a way that congresswomen, other than yourself, will presume they can cast a vote for this safely in her district?  How do other members of Congress go back and say, ""No, this is a good thing. We're going to do this""?"
195,"REP. SCHULTZ:  Because the American people support the pieces of this plan, and, after Thursday, they see through the Republican--the Republican mantra that we need to start over.  Start over means do nothing.  I mean, make no mistake about it.  It's disingenuous for my colleague to suggest that they really want to cover people when the only thing they've got out there covers three million people.  Our--nothing in their plan would bring down costs.  We have the largest tax cut for small businesses and people paying--who pay for health care in our bill in American history.  And that's the bottom line.  We have cost reduction, we have comprehensive coverage, we cover 31 million people, and they don't even come close."
196,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Congressman Cantor, let me revise that by asking this, what specifically--you had the bill piled up in front of you--what can you say yes to that's in the president's revised proposal?  Anything?"
197,"REP. CANTOR:  We, we can--listen, David, let's take a step back for a second, because this notion that somehow Republicans never came forward with solutions, I think the American people are over that now."
198,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but hold on."
199,REP. CANTOR:  Even Ron...
200,MR. GREGORY:  But what you said specifically is there is a big difference in scope:  30 million covered vs. three million covered.
201,"REP. CANTOR:  Well, and..."
202,MR. GREGORY:  Difference in the role of government.  We established that.
203,"REP. CANTOR:  And what we say, what we say is this, our approach is an incremental approach.  It is not do nothing.  I think that's a tired
argument."
204,REP. SCHULTZ:  Do very little.
205,"REP. CANTOR:  It's an incremental approach.  Let's talk about doing the first thing, which is bringing down healthcare costs.  That's how this whole debate began over a year ago at the White House when the president had his first summit.  Then we go about trying..."
206,REP. SCHULTZ:  Where's the evidence that you'd do that?
207,"REP. CANTOR:  ...to do the kind of things--well, we, we certainly--the CBO has validated that we bring down healthcare insurance premiums without a doubt.  So that helps folks who have it, and we can expand coverage.  We also say, ""Look, we don't approve of denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions.  We have a plan..."
208,REP. SCHULTZ:  It's not in your bill.
209,"REP. CANTOR:  Absolutely, it's in our bill."
210,REP. SCHULTZ:  It isn't.
211,REP. CANTOR:  We have a plan that creates universal access programs at the state level which allows folks to access insurance if they're denied by their insurer.
212,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
213,"REP. CANTOR:  David, let me, let me, let me just bring to..."
214,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, wait.  Quickly respond to anything there that you
think should be..."
215,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Well, well, no.  In fact, CBO has estimated that both plans, both the Democratic plan and the Republican plan, if you're looking at existing insurance--your existing insurance plan--would bring down premiums by about the same amount for the apples to apples.  CBO says roughly for the Republicans, 5 to 8, roughly 7 to 10 percent for Democrats, on the effect, on the same plan.  Now, the reason why Democratic--the cost goes up, and this is a question I think Democrats are going to have to answer as they go forward on this, is that they are mandating a richer plan than, than, than, than in some cases, people--a more comprehensive plan than people now have, as the baseline in these, in these exchanges."
216,REP. SCHULTZ:  Ron...
217,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  So one of the questions I think Democrats may be asking themselves is can they bring down the cost of this somewhat by moving back away from some of those, some of those mandates.  But if you look at the CBO analysis of both kind of core proposals, remember, their impact on insurance premiums, it's very similar for people who..."
218,"REP. SCHULTZ:  David, if you look at..."
219,"MR. MORIAL:  David, if I could..."
220,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, hold, hold on.  Let me get Kat, let me get Kat in here for a second on this question, too, of what are Republicans saying yes to, which goes to the overall question is, the politics for Republicans here. What's it worth to them to have any sort of reform or not to?"
221,"MS. KAY:  Well, it seems to me at the moment the politics of the Republicans is to say--to carry on saying no.  I don't see where the value for the Republicans politically is to signing up pretty much to anything.  They do believe that they have public opinion on their side on this, and they will be able, in November, if health care doesn't pass, to turn to the public and say, ""Look, the White House was expending an awful lot of energy on trying to get the president's signature bill through, when what he should have been concentrating on was jobs, jobs, jobs and the economy."" And you can see the Republican..."
222,"MR. MORIAL:  Here's, here's, here's--no, no."
223,MS. KAY:  ...the Republican ads being written at the moment if this bill isn't passed.
224,"MR. MORIAL:  Here's what--here's what, here's what the people deserve. They deserve an up or down vote and not a lot of procedural delay tactics, the use of all sorts of measures.  We deserve, the people deserve, an up or down vote on health care.  Let everyone put their
proposals on the table, let the House of Representatives and the Senate vote it up or down.  That's what the..."
225,MS. KAY:  The risk for that--the risk for that is...
226,REP. SCHULTZ:  I think the...
227,"REP. CANTOR:  Let me weigh on this.  Let me, let me just weigh in right now because, I'll tell you one thing, if Speaker Pelosi rams through this bill through the House using the reconciliation process..."
228,REP. SCHULTZ:  Just like--a simple majority vote.
229,"REP. CANTOR:  ...they, they will, they will lose.  They..."
230,"MR. GREGORY:  Hold on, hold on.  One at a time."
231,REP. CANTOR:  They will lose their majority in Congress in November.
232,MS. KAY:  I think--this...
233,REP. SCHULTZ:  Hold on.
234,"MR. GREGORY:  No, but hold on.  Let me just--I want to just follow the issue of reconciliation.  But, Congressman, reconciliation has been used many times before by the, by the Republicans."
235,"REP. CANTOR:  Absolutely.  Listen, there are differences in every instance when reconciliation was used."
236,REP. SCHULTZ:  The Bush tax cuts pork package.
237,"REP. CANTOR:  This is, this is something, health care, that is going to alter a significant portion of our economy."
238,MR. GREGORY:  Can I just...
239,"REP. CANTOR:  And if they do this, this--the public does not like this bill. And so it's, it's that somehow..."
240,REP. SCHULTZ:  That's not true.
241,REP. CANTOR:  ...the Democratic majority just won't listen to the public. If they do this...
242,REP. SCHULTZ:  No.  At the end of the day here...
243,MS. KAY:  Just...
244,"MR. GREGORY:  Can I, can I just--all right."
245,"REP. SCHULTZ:  David, let me--I need to respond."
246,REP. CANTOR:  If they do this and don't allow us to start over with an incremental approach...
247,REP. SCHULTZ:  Let me respond to what he's saying here.
248,MR. GREGORY:  OK.  Quick comment.
249,"REP. SCHULTZ:  Because the Republicans have repeatedly said that they agree with 80 percent of what's in our bill.  And, at the end of the day, what we need to do is sit down and negotiate over the differences on the 20 percent. The Republicans right now are focused all about regaining power.  They don't have any interest in us accomplishing comprehensive
healthcare reform.  That's been evident.  There isn't anyone that is saying, ""Come on, let's just work this out."" What they're saying is, ""Start over."" Start over, the American people understand, means do nothing."
250,"REP. CANTOR:  David--how can, how can you say that?"
251,"REP. SCHULTZ:  Because if we are successful--because if we're successful, then they lose."
252,MR. GREGORY:  Final point.  Hold on.  Final point before I move to the politics.
253,"Congressman, I want this very narrow point.  What would be in a revised bill that you could vote for?  What, out of all the president's ideas, could you support now?"
254,"REP. CANTOR:  Well, we, we could start with implementing real medical malpractice reform.  We could start by creating universal access programs at the state level to allow those who are being denied coverage by their insurance company right now the ability to access insurance.  We could put in place the ability, real ability, for people to purchase insurance across state lines for real competition that would help bring down costs."
255,"MR. GREGORY:  And if those elements--for instance, those three elements, you could vote for it under those circumstances?"
256,"REP. CANTOR:  If, if you listen to my discussion and my comments with the president on--at the Blair House, when he asked that, I said, ""Look, it is the construct of the bill."" It goes back to the level of mandate from Washington, And the president and I had an exchange about why is it that we need the secretary of Health and Human Services here in Washington telling people what benefits should look like."
257,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to just--no, hold on, I just want to move--I want to move beyond some of the fine points of this to go a little bit larger in terms of the politics."
258,"Katty, Charlie Cook talked about what all this means politically this year, and this is what he said in a report as Politico reported it this week.  ""I think choosing to take a Captain Ahab-like approach to health care - I'm going to push or this even in the worst downturn since the Great Depression - is roughly comparable to Bush's decision to go to war. It basically destroyed the first year of a presidency."" Does the president comes through this, however it turns out, tarnished in some way?  Is he hurt as he goes into the midterm race?"
259,"MS. KAY:  No.  I think to some extent, the whole debate, politically, about reconciliation, is a little bit of a red herring, because, if this bill passes and it proves to be popular with the American people, it will be judged on its merits.  If it passes and proves to be unpopular, it
would also be judged on those merits.  People will soon forget how it was passed.  That's what happened with welfare reform.  It took all of us a little while to dig out our books and remember that welfare reform was actually passed through reconciliation.  People don't remember the
bickering beforehand.  They will vote for--they will support or not support this bill on its merits.  Now, the problem, I think, for the president, is that this is gumming up all of the time he needs to be spending on other things.  Business leaders are going to the White House
and saying, ""We cannot make decisions about trying to hire people because we don't know what our costs are going to be.  We don't know what our healthcare costs are going to be.  We don't know what the energy plan's going to be.  We don't know what the tax reform is going to be."" So they--they're not making decisions.  They are frozen because Washington
is frozen, and he needs to get moving on..."
260,MR. GREGORY:  Mark...
261,MS. KAY:  ...on these legislative issues.
262,"MR. GREGORY:  Mark, the, the, debate, of course, is how close does the president get to legislation like this?  There's a reason why, with all respect, members of Congress often suffer in their popularity because sausage making, lawmaking, is not a popular thing in the public.  Does he risk the tarnish of being too close to the process now that he's decided to get this close? "
263,"MR. MORIAL:  I think he takes credit for being able to get something very big and something significant done.  Poll numbers change, public opinion changes. What people are reacting to is a messy, confusing process.  I think that a victory on health care will help the president.  He's staked his first year of the presidency on it.  People can debate whether he should have done something else.  But the fact of the matter is, he's on the goal line and now I think people want to see him get the ball in the end zone and pass his plan."
264,"MR. GREGORY:  Ron, the, the effect on the election?"
265,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  I agree with both of them.  I--look, I think that the--this really is a gut-check moment for the Democrats.  They have not won the debate to this point.  And it is not unusual.  Every other president who has tried to do this has found it is very difficult in a
prospective manner to convince the country that government can reform a system this complex, especially at a time when you have such distrust of government after the 2008 financial meltdown. And I think the choice before them is exactly right, as Katty said, I don't think people are going to remember very long how this was done.  If they do go ahead with
this, they would have to do so in the belief that they can turn around those poll numbers and convince the country that this is worth doing. And, ultimately, this has, this has been, you know, a top priority for every Democratic president since Truman.  They are, as, as Mr. Morial
says, on the goal line.  And if they don't do it, I think it would be a striking admission that they do not believe, in the end, they can win this argument about an issue at the core of the party's mission for many decades."
266,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me move, let me move on.  There was another question I wanted to ask you regarding Charlie Rangel."
267,REP. SCHULTZ:  OK.
268,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman Rangel of New York, who was criticized by the Ethics Committee for a series of trips that he took down to the Caribbean. Should he retain his job?"
269,"REP. SCHULTZ:  Well, I think we, obviously, when a member is found to have violated House ethics rules, it's a very serious thing, and there are a number of other investigations that are ongoing.  And I think what Speaker Pelosi has said is that we need to look at the totality of those recommendations and wait till the--all the investigations are completed to--before a decision is rendered on that."
270,MR. GREGORY:  But you're concerned about the finding?
271,"REP. SCHULTZ:  Obviously, anytime a member is found to have violated House ethics rules, it's deeply concerning."
272,"MR. GREGORY:  What's going to happen, Congressman?"
273,"REP. CANTOR:  I mean, look, Nancy Pelosi said in the very beginning this is going to be the most open, honest and ethical Congress in history. And what we're seeing is she's breaking that promise every day.  And I'm sure my colleague..."
274,REP. SCHULTZ:  The ethical...
275,"REP. CANTOR:  ...would, I'm--would join me in saying that the American people would say right away Charlie Rangel should step aside in--from being chairman of the most major committee in Congress..."
276,REP. SCHULTZ:  We have the ethics process.
277,"REP. CANTOR:  ...after having been found to be in, in violation of House rules, House rules.  And, as we know in press reports, this is only the tip of the iceberg.  So, you know, listen, I have--I called for his stepping down... "
278,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
279,"REP. CANTOR:  ...before even this finding, and now I do think it's time for, for that."
280,"MR. GREGORY:  Ron, does he make it, do you think?"
281,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  This is the first shoe.  I think that this is not enough by itself, but I think many Democrats are expecting that the further revelations on the, on the ongoing investigation on his financial dealings may create irresistible pressure for him to step down."
282,MR. MORIAL:  I strongly support...
283,"REP. SCHULTZ:  But, Ron, the important thing is, yeah."
284,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.  Yeah.
285,"MR. MORIAL:  ...Charlie Rangel, and his future is up to the voters who
elected him."
286,REP. SCHULTZ:  The important thing to know.
287,"MR. MORIAL:  He's had a long, great career in Congress, and I think there's always going to be a lot of back and forth about ethics investigations.  Not to sanction what he said, but his future should be up to the voters of his district."
288,REP. SCHULTZ:  David...
289,"MR. GREGORY:  Katty, another interesting point, another political situation. In New York, Governor Paterson saying he will not pursue his campaign for governor, striking because here you have the Obama administration, who tried to get him to back out of this race months ago,
unsuccessfully, and now the scandal involving his administration and any potential interference with the domestic violence situation involving one of his aides has now come to the point where he's still in the job, still calls for him to resign outright."
290,"MS. KAY:  Front page paper calls for him to resign, out from nearly all of the New York City papers included.  I think it's a suggestion, isn't it, that the White House's bid earlier to try to get him to resign is a--is an indication of the limitations of the White House's clout when it
comes to Democrats all around the country.  I mean, they've, they've had this problem in elections across the country as well, in trying to support Democrats who didn't then get elected.  It is something that makes the White House not look particularly powerful."
291,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  You know, you know, it's a, it's a measure of the kind of year it is right now for Democrats..."
292,MS. KAY:  Right.
293,MR. BROWNSTEIN:  ...that often the best headline for them this year is when somebody steps aside in the race.
294,MS. KAY:  Is a Democrat steps down.
295,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Bill Ritter, Chris Dodd, Paterson."
296,MS. KAY:  From the White House point of view...
297,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  I mean, that is, that is a tough year when the good news is somebody isn't running."
298,"MS. KAY:  From the White House point of view, it might have been
better..."
299,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
300,"MS. KAY:  ...if it was the White House who asked them to step aside, and then he would step aside then."
301,MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Yes.
302,MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Good.  Final point that you...
303,"REP. SCHULTZ:  The, the bottom line, when it comes to ethics reforms, is that we got the Ethics Committee--Democrats got the Ethics Committee moving again. It's an effective process that was totally neutered under the, under the Republicans.  And now we have an Ethics Committee that is fully functioning and making sure that we take care of the ethics problems when they're there."
304,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We are going to leave it there.  Thanks to all of you.  Covered a lot of ground.
305,"We will talk more with Mark Morial about the National Urban League's century of service to American communities.  It's in our MEET THE PRESS Take Two Web extra.  It's up this afternoon.  Plus, look for updates from me throughout the week.  It's all on our Web site, mtp.msnbc.com."

son that I mentioned here a couple of weeks ago.  So it's Ryan Miller and Team USA all the way."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, a new year and new fears about
terrorism. Questions mount after this man slips by U.S. intelligence and
airport security, nearly blowing up a U.S. airliner Christmas Day.  What
more is known about the plot?  How did U.S. intelligence miss so many red
flags?  And is Yemen a new front in the battle against terrorists?  The
president orders a review.
    "
1,(Videotape)
2,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  I've directed my counterterrorism and homeland
security adviser at the White House, John Brennan, to lead these reviews
going forward and to present the final results and recommendations to me
in the days to come."
3,(End videotape)
4,"MR. GREGORY:  With us live this morning, John Brennan.  Then the politics
of fighting terror.  Republicans accuse the Obama administration of
letting the country's guard down by failing to treat the fight against
terror as an all-out war.  What more should be done to keep Americans
safe?  Are extra security measures at the airports the answer?  With us,
two members of the Bush administration's national security team:  former
Director of the CIA Michael Hayden, and former Secretary of Homeland
Security Michael Chertoff."
5,"Finally, in this new year, a crowded inbox for the president--terrorism,
unemployment, and the final mile on healthcare reform.  Insights on
what's ahead for the Obama agenda with our roundtable:  NBC News special
correspondent Tom Brokaw, New York Times columnist David Brooks,
Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne, and historian Doris Kearns
Goodwin."
6,"But first, some news this morning.  The U.S. has closed its embassy in
the capital of Yemen because of what officials are calling an active
security threat posed by al-Qaeda there.  The announcement one day after
the president specifically implicated the Yemen-based branch of al-Qaeda
for being behind the Christmas Day terror attempt."
7,(Videotape)
8,"PRES. OBAMA:  It appears that he joined an affiliate of al-Qaeda, and
that this group, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, trained him,
equipped him with those explosives, and directed him to attack that plane
headed for America."
9,(End videotape)
10,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We are joined now live by the president's top
counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan."
11,Welcome to MEET THE PRESS.
12,"MR. JOHN BRENNAN:  Thank you, David."
13,"MR. GREGORY:  This security threat, the reason to close the embassy, is
it because of specific intelligence that says an attack is coming?"
14,"MR. BRENNAN:  Yes, there are indications that al-Qaeda's planning to
carry out an attack in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen.  I spoke with our
ambassador down there, Ambassador Seche, this morning, as well as last
night.  Both the U.S. and the British embassies have been closed to give
the Yemeni government an opportunity to thwart that threat and the plans
that are afoot right now from al-Qaeda."
15,MR. GREGORY:  A threat against our embassy?
16,"MR. BRENNAN:  It's a threat--they--we know that they have been targeting
our embassy, our embassy personnel, and we want to make sure that we do
everything possible to safeguard our diplomats and others that are down
there.  So that was the prudent step to take."
17,"MR. GREGORY:  The president talking about al-Qaeda in Yemen.  Is Yemen a
new front in this battle against al-Qaeda?"
18,"MR. BRENNAN:  No, it's not a new front.  We've known about it for quite
some time; and that's why from the very first day of this administration,
and even in the last administration, there has been tremendous focus on
Yemen.  I traveled out to Yemen twice over the past several months, I
spoke with President Saleh.  I spoke with President Saleh this week.  We
have been focused on this issue.  We need to make sure that we continue
to provide the training, the support that Yemen needs to counter this
very serious threat. There are several hundred al-Qaeda members right now
inside of Yemen, and the fight is being taken to them.  Events during the
last month demonstrated the Yemeni government resolve, and there are a
number of operatives and leaders of al-Qaeda in Yemen that are no longer
with us today because of those actions."
19,"MR. GREGORY:  Is the U.S. providing fire power to the, the Yemen
government?"
20,"MR. BRENNAN:  The U.S. is providing a range of support that includes
security, intelligence, and military support to the Yemeni government.
We're doing this in close cooperation with the Yemenis, we're doing it
the right way, and we've been able to make some progress."
21,"MR. GREGORY:  The president said that those behind the Christmas Day plot
will be held accountable, will be held accountable.  Should the American
people expect military action by the United States in Yemen?"
22,"MR. BRENNAN:  I think the American people should expect that its
government is going to do everything, in fact, to hold those individuals
accountable whether they're in Yemen, whether they're in other places.
Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula poses a serious threat.  They have
attacked our embassy before, they've carried out attacks in Saudi Arabia
against Saudi targets, and now it's very clear that they're trying to
bring those attacks to the homeland.  We're not going to let them do
that.  We're going to take strong action against them."
23,MR. GREGORY:  So military action is possible in Yemen?
24,"MR. BRENNAN:  Everything is possible as far as our cooperation with the
Yemeni government.  We want to make sure that the Yemenis have what they
need to thwart these threats."
25,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me talk more about the Christmas Day plot.  Last week
the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, said the system
worked.  Do you agree?"
26,"MR. BRENNAN:  Clearly the system didn't work on that day because
Abdulmutallab should never have gotten onto that plane with those
explosives. You know, every other day the system has worked so far this
year.  We've been able to thwart attempts by Mr. Najibullah Zazi, David
Headley, and others. But clearly what the president is--wants to do is to
make sure that we strengthen the system.  It's not that the system is
broken, but clearly there are ways to improve the system, strengthen it,
to make sure that we can put together the various bits and pieces of
information in a way that allows us to stop every single terrorist out
there."
27,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let me get to that, because this seems to be a big
issue in terms of how could certain things have happened.  You know, a
lot of Americans remember the way the Unabomber was brought to justice
was the fact that his brother turned him in.  When a family member says,
""I'm worried,"" that should be a big red flag.  And, in fact,
Abdulmutallab's father, a Nigerian businessman, a prominent figure in
Nigeria, goes to the U.S. embassy and says, ""My son went to Yemen.  He's
become a radical.  I'm worried."" And yet somehow that doesn't shoot to
the top of warning signs for U.S. intelligence.  Why not?"
28,"MR. BRENNAN:  Well, you--well, you know, every day there are people who
bring to our attention concerns that they have about either family
members or others who are--have joined the ranks of extremists.  The five
guys from northern Virginia, those that actually went out to Pakistan, it
was because their families brought it to the attention of the
authorities.  We took very strong action and the Pakistanis were able to
put them into custody.  In the case of Abdulmutallab, his father did
express concerns to us about that he was consorting with extremists in
Yemen.  The failure within the system was that we didn't take that
information and connect it to the other bits and pieces of information
that came through the intelligence collection systems.  It's a, a
requirement that we are able to bring to bear all those disparate bits
and pieces in a way that allows us to identify the individuals.  We had
some information in intelligence channels that didn't give us the clarity
we needed to know who the individual was that al-Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula was using.  What we need to do is to make sure that this never
happens again."
29,"MR. GREGORY:  But, you're an experienced intelligence official here.
Were these knowable red flags?  Should they have been caught and put
together?"
30,"MR. BRENNAN:  Yes, they should have been.  And that's what we need to do
is to make sure that this never happens again."
31,"MR. GREGORY:  Where's the accountability?  Does somebody need to lose
their job?"
32,"MR. BRENNAN:  As the president said, there's going to be accountability
at all levels, and he has to take a look at it.  But let me say a couple
of things on this.  First of all, Janet Napolitano has done a tremendous
job over the past year.  I've worked very closely with her, and I know
there were a number of criticisms about her comments about ""the system
worked."" What she was referring to, and she's clarified her remarks, the
system worked after the incident.  What the president wants to do is to
make sure that we're able to take the corrective steps necessary to
prevent this from happening again.  But he needs to hold everybody
accountable, including me."
33,"MR. GREGORY:  Newsweek magazine has a cover story that's on newsstands
coming out this week about the children of bin Laden; that's the cover
story.  And in it there's reporting about specific information that you
received before the Christmas Day plot, in terror warnings about the use
of explosives being hidden in underwear to get through airport security
and other specific information prior to the act about the, the potential
for a plot that would be based out of Yemen on a U.S. airliner.  What did
you know prior to this incident?"
34,"MR. BRENNAN:  I think what you're referring to is the attempted
assassination against Prince Mohammed bin Nayef in Saudi Arabia by, in
fact, an individual who had concealed on his person PETN, the same
explosive used by Mr. Abdulmutallab.  Right after that attack, I went
out, I met with Prince Mohammed bin Nayef.  I, in fact, saw the room
where the attempted assassination took place.  That information was
provided to us by the Saudi government; we disseminated that information
broadly.  There was no indication, though, that al-Qaeda was trying to
use that type of attack and that modus operandi against aircraft.  We're
very concerned about it from an assassination standpoint, and we continue
to look at all the evidence that is out there so we can take the steps
necessary to prevent any types of attacks from taking place."
35,"MR. GREGORY:  Are we safer than we were in the immediate aftermath of
9/11?"
36,"MR. BRENNAN:  I think the U.S. government has done tremendous work over
the last eight years, nine years, to strengthen our system, strengthen
our security perimeters.  We have now a system in place that the FBI and
CIA, NSA, Department of Homeland Security and others are working very
collaboratively together in;what we need to do is to make sure that
we're able to leverage that system every day, making sure that it's 1,000
percent perfect so that we don't have another person like Abdulmutallab
come in.  So, yes, I think the American people can take comfort in
knowing that the government has worked hard since 9/11 and has made
steady progress not just in terms of helping to secure the country, but
also degrading, disrupting, and we're ultimately going to defeat
al-Qaeda."
37,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but I guess what a lot of people should be concerned
about is that, that sense of, you know, how does this kind of thing
happen where you have multiple inpoints into the system, inputs into the
system, where there's information that looks a lot clearer in hindsight,
obviously, but nevertheless, for trained professionals to look at and
say, ""Ah, this has to go--this have to--has to be blinking bright red.
It has to go to the top of the system."" How do we get from where we
apparently are to that place?"
38,"MR. BRENNAN:  Well, as I said, I think that we have been to that place
many times with the disruption of plots that are taking place sort of every day,
whether it's overseas or here.  Mr. Zazi, Mr. Headley, others, those dots
did come to the surface.  What we need to do, though, is to be able to do
that every day.  But the system is working; it's just not working as well
as it needs to constantly."
39,"MR. GREGORY:  The, the question of airline travel, what needs to be done
to make airline travel safer?"
40,"MR. BRENNAN:  Well, one of the reviews that President Obama has asked for
is for Secretary Napolitano to lead that review as far as looking at the
technologies that are in place at airports, screening practices, the
procedures, the criteria that are used right now for the different watch
lists, the no-fly and selectee.  There's no single silver bullet that's
going to be able to allow us to have that type of assurance that we're
going to be able to stop individuals from coming aboard planes.
It's--has to be a package of things.  It has to be technology, it has to
be expertise, it has to be intelligence, it has to be cooperation with
our international partners.  And so all this has to come together
seamlessly, and it has to be done on a daily basis."
41,"MR. GREGORY:  But do we have to compromise some additional privacy, like
with full-body scanners at the airports, in order to keep up with the
terrorists?"
42,"MR. BRENNAN:  I think there's a way to make sure that we maintain the
type of privacy that is expected by American public, but also provide the
security that is needed.  What we're trying to do now is strike that
balance, looking at the technologies available, looking at the practices
that we use.  But there has to be this very healthy balance.  We maintain
that privacy standard but, at the same time, do everything possible to
prevent attacks."
43,"MR. GREGORY:  So body scanners, do you think they should be deployed more
widely at the airports?"
44,"MR. BRENNAN:  I think it's, I think it's certainly something that needs
to be considered and looked at, and we're looking at it very carefully.
In fact, at the Amsterdam airport there were full-body scanners in place.
They had--they weren't used, in fact, for the airline that was going to
be coming here to the United States.  But I think those full-body
scanners, as well as other things, needs to be part of this package."
45,"MR. GREGORY:  Would those scanners have detected the level of PETN that
Abdulmutallab was carrying?"
46,"MR. BRENNAN:  I think it's unknown.  But I think it would have enhanced
our, our potential for actually identifying it."
47,"MR. GREGORY:  Why isn't he be treat--being treated as an enemy combatant
instead of a criminal?"
48,"MR. BRENNAN:  Well, because, first of all, we're a country of laws, and
what we're going to do is to make sure that we treat each individual case
appropriately.  In the past Richard Reid, the former shoe bomber;
Zacarias Moussaoui; Jose Padilla; Iyman Faris; all of them were charged
in criminal court, were sentenced some in--in some cases to life
imprisonment.  We have these tools available, whether it's an enemy
combatant avenue or to charge them criminally.  We look at the cases, and
in this case we decided it was best, in fact, to charge him criminally."
49,"MR. GREGORY:  Would there be additional intelligence that could be
gleaned by making him an enemy combatant?  And do you believe that
whatever you're learning from him, was the Christmas Day plot part of
something larger from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula?"
50,"MR. BRENNAN:  Well, first of all, we have different ways of obtaining
information from individuals according to that criminal process.  A lot
of people, as they understand what they're facing and their lawyers
recognize that there is advantage to talking to us in terms of plea
agreements, we're going to pursue that.  So--and we are continuing to
look at ways that we can extract that information from him."
51,"As far as a broader plot, that's one of the things that the intelligence
community is working 24/7 right now to see if we can uncover.  Was he a
singleton?  Are there other individuals out there?  And we're doing
everything possible to identify somebody before they even get near an
aircraft."
52,"MR. GREGORY:  What does the intelligence tell you now?  Can you draw
conclusions?"
53,"MR. BRENNAN:  I think we have to assume that there are others out there.
But what we're doing is making sure that we are working with our
partners, working with others to stop that person before they actually
are able to get aboard an aircraft."
54,"MR. GREGORY:  What about the issue of Guantanamo Bay?  So many of the
prisoners there come from Yemen, have been returned to Yemen in the
previous administration and in this administration as well.  The Democrat
who runs the Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein, says we should
stop, stop sending them back there.  What's the president's position?"
55,"MR. BRENNAN:  Well, first of all, we have undertaken a very methodical
process as far as looking at all the individuals at Guantanamo Bay.  The
last administration transferred over 530 Guantanamo detainees abroad.  In
this administration, we have transferred about 42.  What we've tried to
do is look at each individual case, make decisions about whether they
should be prosecuted either under Article III court or military court, or
transfer them abroad, repatriate them to their countries of, of origin or
to another country.  In the case of Yemen, we have, in fact, sent back
seven individuals. Previous administration sent back 13 to Yemen.  Of the
recent batch that we sent back, about six, many of them are in custody
within the Yemeni system right now.  We are looking at it every day.
We're not going to make any decisions that are going to put people at
risk.  We will decide and determine when, when we should send additional
people back.  But we're going to do it in the right way, because
Guantanamo should be closed.  It was used as a propaganda tool by
al-Qaeda, and the president is still committed to it."
56,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, they use a lot of things as, as propaganda tools.  Is
this really the way to keep America safe, by sending back prisoners to
Yemen who might turn around and become part of an organization that's
becoming more robust there?"
57,"MR. BRENNAN:  We're just going to make sure that we don't do anything
that puts American security at risk, whether it's Americans who are in
Yemen or here in the United States.  But we need to make sure that we are
a country of laws and we maintain that standard so that we are able to
treat these individuals the way they should be treated, prosecute them if
we have the information available to us, transfer them back.  But make
sure that if they're transferred back, the countries that receive them
take the appropriate steps to safeguard us and them."
58,"MR. GREGORY:  Republicans have been very critical of this president and
accuse him of returning to a pre-9/11 mentality, of becoming lax in the
face of terror, of essentially letting America's guard down.  Former Vice
President Dick Cheney said this to Politico this past week.  Let me put
his comment up on the screen.  ""As I've watched the events of the last
few days it is clear once again that President Obama is trying to pretend
we are not at war.  He seems to think if he has a low-key response to an
attempt to blow up an airliner and kill hundreds of people, we won't be
at war.  ...  He seems to think if we bring the mastermind of September
11 to New York, give him a lawyer and trial in civilian court, we won't
be at war.  He seems to think if he closes Guantanamo and releases the
hard-core al-Qaeda-trained terrorists still there, we won't be at war.
He seems to think if he gets rid of the words, `war on terror,' we won't
be at war.  But we are at war and when President Obama pretends we
aren't, it makes us less safe."" How do you respond to that?"
59,"MR. BRENNAN:  I'm very disappointed in the vice president's comments.
I'm neither Republican nor Democrat.  I've worked for the past five
administrations.  And either the vice president is willfully
mischaracterizing this president's position, both in terms of the
language he uses and the actions he taken--he's taken, or he's ignorant
of the facts.  And in either case, it doesn't speak well of what the vice
president's doing.  The clear evidence is that this president has been
very, very strong.  In his inaugural address, he said, ""We're at war with
this international network of terrorists."" We continue to say that we're
at war with al-Qaeda.  We're trying to give it some clarity.  And we have
taken the fight to them.  We've continued, in fact, many of the, of the
activities of the previous administration.  I would not have come back
into this government if I felt that this president was not committed to
prosecuting this war against al-Qaeda.  And every day I see it in the
president's face, I see it in the actions he's taken, and so I'm
confident that this country is, in fact, protected by this president's
position on al-Qaeda and against terrorist activities.  We're going to
continue to do this, we're going to do it hard, we're going to do it
constantly."
60,"MR. GREGORY:  Is it anything less than a failure that eight years after
9/11 Osama bin Laden has still not been captured?"
61,"MR. BRENNAN:  This is something that has bedeviled this government for
many, many years.  We're going to continue to hunt him down.  Ultimately,
we're going to get him.  We're going to get bin Laden, we're going to get
Zawahiri, we're going to get the others.  There's been a very strong
track record over this past year and, in fact, over the past number of
years in terms of finding these operatives, finding these commanders and
either capturing or killing them.  It's going to happen with bin Laden.
Every day we get one day closer, and hopefully it's going to be very
soon."
62,"MR. GREGORY:  When's the last time he was pinned down by the U.S. or its
allies, or close to being killed?"
63,"MR. BRENNAN:  Well, I think, you know, the, the evidence is that Tora
Bora we came very close, in fact, to finding him, getting him, and
capturing him. Intelligence is working every day on this, and I'm not
going to go into that. But there are some dedicated men and women, and I
think just the, the events this past week, the tragic death of seven CIA
officers, underscores just the bravery and the risks that these
courageous men and women who put their lives on the line every day on
behalf of their fellow Americans.  And we have that throughout the
intelligence community.  And I think we have to remember who the enemy
here is.  The enemy is al-Qaeda.  And as this finger-pointing is going on
in Washington here, these partisan politics and agendas, quite frankly, I
find it very disappointing that people would use this issue, issue of
tremendous import of national security and forget that it is al-Qaeda
that is killing our citizens."
64,"MR. GREGORY:  We'll leave it there.  Mr. Brennan, thank you very much."
65,"MR. BRENNAN:  Thank you very much, David."
66,MR. GREGORY:  Appreciate it.
67,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We're joined now by two members of the Bush
administration's national security team, former Secretary of Homeland
Security Michael Chertoff and former Director of the CIA Michael Hayden."
68,Welcome to both of you.
69,"GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN (RET.):  Thank you, David."
70,"MR. GREGORY:  General Hayden, let me begin with you.  Reaction to what
you've heard here from Mr. Brennan, specifically on new threats being
posed by Yemen and al-Qaeda in Yemen?"
71,"GEN. HAYDEN:  No, I, I agree totally with what John pointed out.  We've
been watching Yemen for some time.  In fact, as pressure's increased on
al-Qaeda in the tribal region of Pakistan, we always look to Yemen and
Somalia as a place where the senior leadership could flee to.  Now, the
senior leadership has not gone there, but we have seen a steady growth in
al-Qaeda in Yemen since about 2006.  If you recall then, David, there was
a massive jailbreak in Yemen, about two dozen al-Qaeda members that were
incarcerated there escaped.  And from that point on, where--we've seen a
steady growth of al-Qaeda and their use of Yemen as a safe haven."
72,"MR. GREGORY:  Should there be some accountability on the part of Bush
national security officials like yourself, at a time when there were
detainees from Guantanamo released back to Yemen, at a time when Yemen
and al-Qaeda there was becoming more robust, that the administration did
not do more to specifically target the al-Qaeda threat?"
73,"GEN. HAYDEN:  Well, we worked very hard on it.  As John pointed out,
there's a, there's a continuum of action between President Bush's
administration and President Obama's administration with regard to these
national security threats.  Now, true to be said that we did release some
folks from Guantanamo, despite our best efforts making this threat
assessment, that actually returned to the battlefield, to, to return to
terrorism; and certainly we bear responsibility for that."
74,"MR. GREGORY:  Is this a new front in the war on terror, as you see it,
Yemen?"
75,"GEN. HAYDEN:  It is a growing front.  It is, it is, as John pointed out,
it's not all that new.  We've seen it coming for some time.  It's always
been unsettled.  And since, again, since about 2006, we've seen it take a
more prominent role in al-Qaeda's safe havens in ungoverned areas in the
world."
76,"MR. GREGORY:  Are you concerned if the administration decides to release
any additional prisoners from Guantanamo to Yemen?"
77,"GEN. HAYDEN:  This is a very difficult question.  Each of these have to
be decided individually.  The only counsel I would offer, as we recognize
how difficult this is, we made some mistakes, and I would not be governed
by any artificial timeline.  I'd take my time with this and be careful."
78,"MR. GREGORY:  The mistakes being the, the release of the prisoners, is
that what you're referring to?"
79,"GEN. HAYDEN:  Yeah, exactly, exactly."
80,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
81,"GEN. HAYDEN:  That some people that we decided to release, with our best
judgment at the time, have returned to the fight.  That should be a
cautionary tale for President Obama's administration."
82,"MR. GREGORY:  So don't close Guantanamo, is your point?"
83,"GEN. HAYDEN:  I would not be in a rush to close Guantanamo.  But, David,
to be fair, we were trying to reduce the population at Guantanamo as
quickly and as carefully as we could in the Bush administration."
84,"MR. GREGORY:  Secretary Chertoff, so much has been made of failures on
the part of this administration.  Is the other way to look at this that
it has become enormously difficult to pull off an attack against the
United States, that what we're seeing are low-level, incompetent people
who can't quite pull it off?  Is that not a positive sign for U.S.
intelligence, for U.S. security?"
85,"MR. CHERTOFF:  Well, I, I think that's exactly right, David, and I think,
as John points out first, to put it in perspective, as troubling as this
incident is, we have seen occasion after occasion where we have disrupted
plots, and we've batted almost 100 percent.  And I think this plot also
demonstrates, because of the complexity and the fact that they had to use
a new operative, that they are actually being forced to work under a
great deal of pressure and are handicapped in carrying out these plots,
precisely because we have made it difficult, although not impossible, to
smuggle explosives onto airplanes."
86,MR. GREGORY:  What went wrong here?
87,"MR. CHERTOFF:  I think that the, the review that John's going to
undertake is going to be very specific about that.  It strikes me that
what we're going to look at are two possible areas.  One is was there a
failure not to connect the dots in the sense of bringing them together,
but to understand the significance of what those dots were.  And I think
that's an important part of the inquiry.  The second piece is, as John
pointed out, is there were scanners in the airport in Amsterdam that were
not used.  Why were they not used? European--the European Union has
banned the use of these devices because of privacy issues.  And I think
that's going to cause another debate about where we strike the balance
between privacy on the one hand and the right to life that every air
traveler has when they get on an airplane."
88,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to come back to this body scanner issue in just a
minute, but I want to, I want to press you on this point about both the
gathering of intelligence, the sharing of intelligence.  Again, the
accountability question for Bush administration officials like yourself.
The Bush administration created these extra layers of intelligence
gathering and dissemination and yet left office before they were proven
to be effective, clearly.  We have so many ways to gather intelligence
and to look at this intelligence, and yet the government's still not
talking to each other."
89,"MR. CHERTOFF:  Well, first, I have to say, David, I mean, it was
obviously effective during the seven years that we had after 2001 because
we did not have an attack or anything even approaching a successful
attack.  And, frankly, it was successful through most of this year
because of the number of plots you've seen disrupted, including Headley,
Zazi, the five jihadis who went over to Pakistan who've been apprehended.
So, actually, the real story is the enormous amount of success we have
had.  But it's not perfect, and I think that this is an occasion to look
and see what do we need to do to improve the system, even though I think
the architecture's basically sound and has served us well over eight
years."
90,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me return to the, the body scanner issue.  As you have
pointed out numerous times, and we've talked about before, you are a
consultant for a company that makes the type of body scanners that you
advocate, although it's something that you advocated as homeland security
secretary as well.  Would they have done the job?  Would they have
detected the amount of PT--PETN that he had on board?"
91,"MR. CHERTOFF:  I believe the answer to that is yes.  Of course, no
technology is perfect, but this would dramatically increase the ability
to detect things that are concealed underneath people's clothing, on
their bodies.  We've known about this problem for years.  In 2005 I
testified about this before Congress. I said, ""We have got to deploy
these kinds of capabilities, otherwise people are gong to smuggle in
explosives or weapons hidden on parts of their body."" I have been through
the machine myself; I have looked at the image.  I think we have taken
steps in the deployments that we have undertaken to protect privacy.  At
the end of the day, no one has come up with a better solution, and
keeping your fingers crossed that the enemy won't figure out this
vulnerability is a very foolish way to manage security."
92,"MR. GREGORY:  General Hayden, same question I asked John Brennan, which
is are we safer as a country since the immediate aftermath of 9/11?"
93,"GEN. HAYDEN:  Absolutely.  I mean, as John pointed out, it's not that--a
question that the system broke down, it's a--it's a question that the
system needs to be improved.  We, we are facing a learning enemy.  This
is an enemy that adapts, and we have to adapt with that, with that enemy.
One case in point.  One of the--some of the early stories that came out
were--was that the information was not shared, which was the belief that
what happened prior to the attacks on September 11th, 2001.  That is
simply not the case in this incident.  This information was shared, it
was available.  What it was not was, was, was not highlighted, it was not
connected.  And that's a human activity, and that's a very difficult
task.  And, as you pointed out, this becomes easier only in retrospect.
In, in, in prospect, these are very difficult things to do."
94,"MR. GREGORY:  It's interesting.  Secretary Chertoff, you were on this
program back in 2006, and you touted the government's ability at that
time to look for vulnerabilities, to come together as a group and try to
outthink the terrorists.  And yet this is what the former inspector
general of homeland security had to say in an op/ed in The New York Times
this past week.  He said, ""Perhaps the biggest lesson for airline
security from the recent incident is that we must overcome our tendency
to be reactive.  We always seem to be at least one step behind the
terrorists."" Is that the case?"
95,"MR. CHERTOFF:  Well, I don't think that's true, and I think, as I say,
this was a problem we anticipated, the notion of someone concealing
explosives.  I also have to point out that the screening failure took
place overseas, and that, that does reflect some issues we have with
sharing of information, where the Europeans are reluctant because of
privacy.  I think the problem has been not so much the recognition but
the implementation.  There has been an enormous amount of resistance, and
not just in the issue of technology but in the issue of secure
documentation and other things that we've done, by groups that simply
don't believe that we ought to have these security measures.  It took us
years to get the Western Hemisphere document requirements in place
because we had a tremendous amount of political resistance.  So I think
this is an opportunity to reinvigorate the willpower."
96,"MR. GREGORY:  General Hayden, are we effectively ethnically profiling
potential suspects who want to hurt the United States?"
97,"GEN. HAYDEN:  I, I, I'm not quite sure of the context in which you're
asking the question, David, about ethnically profiling.  But with regard
to intelligence..."
98,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, isn't there a profile of who we think the terrorists
are?"
99,"GEN. HAYDEN:  Of, of, of, of, of course there is."
100,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
101,"GEN. HAYDEN:  But it's based more on behavior.  I mean, for example, the
individual in question here, Abdulmutallab.  I mean, he would not have
automatically fit a profile if you were standing next to him in the visa
line at Dulles, for example.  So it's the behavior that we're attempting
to profile.  And it's the behavior, these little bits and pieces of
information that were in the databases, that we didn't quite stitch
together at this point in time.  But it wasn't question of ethnicity or,
or religion.  Those, those are contributing factors.  But it's what
people do that we should be paying attention to."
102,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but I, but I want to press Secretary Chertoff on this
point whether--because I've spoken to counterterror officials who'll say
it's more than a contributing factor.  We know who 90 percent of these
terrorists are.  There may be other examples of women being used and the
what--and whatnot.  But Islamic males between the age of 20 and 30 make
up roughly 90 percent of that profile.  Is that an inappropriate or
appropriate way for law enforcement to be targeting individuals?"
103,"MR. CHERTOFF:  I think relying on, on preconceptions of stereotypes is,
is actually kind of misleading and arguably dangerous.  Obviously, you
want to..."
104,MR. GREGORY:  So that's wrong?  That profile's wrong?
105,MR. CHERTOFF:  Correct.
106,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
107,"MR. CHERTOFF:  While I--now, what I would say is you want to look at
things like where has a person traveled to, where have they spent time,
what has their behavior been.  But recognize, one of the things
al-Qaeda's done is deliberately tried to recruit people who don't fit the
stereotype, who are Western in background or appearance.  Look at a--like
a guy like an Adam Gadahn, who grew up in California, who's one of the
senior level al-Qaeda operatives but does not fit the normal prejudice
about what a--an extremist looks like."
108,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about politics.  I read the comments by the
former vice president, General Hayden.  Do you think that it is
responsible for the vice president to criticize President Obama as
letting America's guard down by failing to treat this fight as a war on
terror?"
109,"GEN. HAYDEN:  I'm, I'm not going to comment on, on the current president
or the former vice, vice, vice president, David.  I do know that this is
an important national issue.  It does become part of the political
debate.  But I will offer you a professional's view on the current
atmosphere, the highly-charged atmosphere in Washington.  I would ask, on
behalf of the community of which I used to be a part, for everyone to
kind of calm down a little bit, stop hyperventilating, let John take this
study, look at this in detail to learn what we can learn from it without
a sense of, of, of attribution or accusation.  I mean, these are tough
challenges."
110,"MR. GREGORY:  But that would apply, that would apply to Bush
administration officials as well.  Because I seem to remember covering
the White House when Bush administration officials thought it was
counterproductive and, indeed, hurtful and harmful to the country to have
Democrats questioning, whether it was the patriotism or, or the overall
wisdom of some of these national security activities."
111,"GEN. HAYDEN:  David, there are broad policy issues here that deserve
intense political debate.  We should let the American system handle that.
But the secretary brought up an interesting one.  What's the balance the
American people want between their privacy and their security?  You can't
just keep coming back to the intel guys after bad things happen and
expect them to perform miracles 100 percent of the time if we don't
address these more serious fundamental questions as a nation.  That's
part of the political process.  And the intel community needs to be a
customer of those decisions."
112,"MR. GREGORY:  But your message is, left or right, Republican, Democrat,
don't politicize this battle.  Is that your point?"
113,"GEN. HAYDEN:  There are policy questions that need to be resolved through
our political process."
114,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you believe the president is adequately confronting this
threat of terrorism?"
115,"GEN. HAYDEN:  I, I, I am heartened by the fact that the president
consistently says, ""We are at war with al-Qaeda and its affiliates."""
116,"MR. GREGORY:  So my question is do you believe he's adequately
prosecuting this war against al-Qaeda and terrorists?"
117,"GEN. HAYDEN:  There are honest differences.  Clearly, this past summer
with regard to some CIA activity, interrogation memos from the office of
legal counsel, the CIAIG report, the question of a special prosecutor, I
actually think that's harmed our overall effort, all right?  But that's a
personal view.  That's the decision the president has to make.  We should
not overly politicize things that are essentially security in nature.
But we do need political guidance that will be the product of our
political process."
118,"MR. GREGORY:  Secretary Chertoff, you told NBC's Pete Williams, our
justice correspondent, this past week, you were concerned that there was a
return in this government to a pre-9/11 mentality.  Explain that."
119,"MR. CHERTOFF:  Well, I'm concerned that we don't use all the tools on the
table, and I--here I have to say I agree with Mike and I agree with John.
I think the president has repeatedly articulated his belief we're at
war. Nevertheless, there are elements of the strategy we have to ask
questions about.  Is it sensible, for example, to bring Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed to New York out of a foreign area in order to try him there?  I,
I think that's a fateful decision and one that I hope that, that the
attorney general has carefully thought through.  There are other
elements, and some of which Mike Hayden's mentioned, which I think maybe
send a little bit of a conflicting message.  So this is a great
opportunity for the administration to make sure that they are not leaving
anything on the table that could be used to defend the American people."
120,"MR. GREGORY:  Finally, do you have confidence in your successor..."
121,MR. CHERTOFF:  I do.
122,MR. GREGORY:  ...Secretary Napolitano?
123,"MR. CHERTOFF:  I, I do.  I've known, I've known her for a long time.
She's got a good skill set, she's got great experience, her heart's in
the right place, and I, I heartily endorse her."
124,"MR. GREGORY:  We'll leave it there.  Thank you both very much for being
here."
125,GEN. HAYDEN:  Thank you.
126,"MR. GREGORY:  Up next, terror, unemployment, health care, all challenges
facing President Obama in the new year.  Our roundtable weighs in on
what's ahead.  Tom Brokaw, David Brooks, E.J. Dionne, and Doris Kearns
Goodwin, only here on MEET THE PRESS."
127,(Announcements)
128,"MR. GREGORY:  Our political roundtable weighs in on the year ahead for
the Obama agenda after this brief commercial break."
129,(Announcements)
130,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We are back, joined by presidential historian Doris
Kearns Goodwin; NBC News' Tom Brokaw; E.J.  Dionne of The Washington
Post, of course; and David Brooks of The New York Times."
131,Welcome to all of you.  Happy new year.
132,"MS. DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:  You, too."
133,"MR. GREGORY:  Tom Brokaw, this Christmas Day plot, if this was the 3 AM
wake-up call that Hillary Clinton talked about in the campaign, it
finally came.  How has the president handled it?"
134,"MR. TOM BROKAW:  Well, I think he was slow off the mark.  I think that
they've been much more responsive since then.  It demonstrates once
again, David, the vulnerability of even great powers like the United
States against an enemy that really is very nimble, very cunning, and
suicidal.  And for all the technology that we have in the world, all the
coordination that goes on with security apparatus in Europe and around
the rest of the world, if one little piece is not in place, somebody can
slip through and have a devastating effect as that bomber might have had
on that Northwest flight that day.  The administration certainly has now
been responding in a much more robust fashion since then."
135,"MR. GREGORY:  We certainly don't do a lot, David Brooks, to celebrate
successes in our security wall in the United States, but the breaches
get, get huge attention here.  How did the administration do?"
136,"MR. DAVID BROOKS:  Not so well.  But the country didn't do so well.
We've got a lot of post-talk geniuses in this country; after the fact
they're brilliant at diagnosing what happened.  We seem to be in a
position where, like teenagers, we expect perfection of our parents and
then we throw a temper tantrum when they don't achieve it.  The fact is
we've got human institutions. I think they do probably a pretty fantastic
job by and large.  I thought John Brennan today was tremendously
impressive."
137,MR. BROKAW:  Mm-hmm.
138,"MR. BROOKS:  And you saw a great agreement between the Bush officials and
the Obama admin officials.  And I thought this is one of the areas of
government that actually generally works.  But it's a human institution.
Human institutions are going to fail.  They gather huge nets of
information; they're not always going to connect the dots.  And if we
throw a temper tantrum or start pointing fingers every time they have a
failure, we're just not going to be a resilient country."
139,"MR. GREGORY:  E.J. Dionne, how, how much damage do we do as a country
with this blame game?  How much comfort do al-Qaeda operatives around the
world take from the fact that Bush blames Clinton, Obama blames Bush,
Cheney seems to blame a lot of people, but, principally, President Obama.
And you heard John Brennan really lash out against the former vice
president for his criticism, and he's worked for both administrations."
140,"MR. E.J. DIONNE:  Right.  Well, I think you pointed that out in the
question that there is a sort of lack of fit here between what
Republicans said when they were in power and what they said when they
were out of power.  But we are a free country.  Politics is always going
to be a factor, and that's something that I wouldn't want to get rid of,
even though some of it can be damaging and some of it is dishonest.  I
think the initial administration response was an effort to be calm and
reassuring.  Some people viewed that as complacency.  As Tom pointed out,
they quickly corrected that and then turned it into urgency. But I think
the biggest favor that was done to President Obama was Dick Cheney coming
out and politicizing this the way he did.  Dick Cheney is the gift who
keeps on giving to Democrats.  When you saw--you saw a lot of Democrats
who've been critical of President Obama on health care or on Afghanistan,
suddenly they all rallied to him.  I think by the end of the week they
had overplayed their hand, and the professionals gathered around this
table a moment ago showed that those folks involved in the fight just
don't want it to be politicized like that."
141,"MR. GREGORY:  Doris, you're familiar with writing long and wonderful
volumes of history.  And if the war on terror, if chapter one was written
by President Bush, now it's chapter two and beyond; and it's still very,
very complicated, an entire decade really defined by, by terrorist acts
at the front end and at the back end, an attempted act at the back end.
So much different than the wars we have fought in our past."
142,"MS. GOODWIN:  True.  But I think there are certain lessons, even though
the war on terror is a war about individuals, loose organizations, it's
not countries, there aren't going to be treaties.  We've learned things
from other wars that I still think are valid here.  Number one, you have
to have allies on your side, and I think that's what the Obama
administration has begun to do.  I mean, after we made the announcement
about the Afghan escalation, NATO put in 7,000 troops.  That showed that
some work had been done at that point. I also keep thinking that somehow
what we really missed in the beginning of this decade on the war on
terror, what would have happened right after September 11th if President
Bush had called for independent--a Manhattan Project for independence
from Middle Eastern oil?  What if he'd called for a lot more people to
join the Army?  We wouldn't have had these same soldiers going back three
and four times.  What if we'd had a tax increase, as we've done in every
other war, to fight a war?  We wouldn't be facing the deficits right now.
So I think even though it's a different war, the need to mobilize the
spirit and the energy of the American people, so it's not just our
soldiers fighting those wars alone over there, is still relevant in
history's terms."
143,"MR. GREGORY:  Tom, what is this leadership test now for President Obama?
And, and you've talked about the leadership test that faced President
Bush. Now this is a young presidency with a new chapter in, in the threat
matrix from terrorism."
144,"MR. BROKAW:  Well, I think that there has to be a new paradigm.  I don't
think--I think that what we've learned is that you can't win the war
against Islamic rage wherever it exists just militarily or even with all
the technical capacity that we have around the world.  We still have not
gotten at the root of this Islamic rage and how we're going to deal with
that.  There's that phrase that I'm not very keen about called ""soft
power."" But we have to have some new way of dealing with these units that
can move, as they do, from Pakistan to Afghanistan to the Arabian
Peninsula and visit great, great harm or the possibility of great harm on
Western nations.  I think Doris is right, I do think we need more help
from our allies in the Western world.  But we also should expect more
from the Islamic world, from the established states in the Islamic world.
And we have to work harder at that to get at these people who have a
crazed idea about how the world should exist."
145,"MR. BROOKS:  But we do have an opportunity right now, I mean, at this
incredible, historic moment in time.  This Islamic extreme--extremism
really got started in 1979 with the Iranian revolution, which is a world
historical event.  Now, obviously Iran is not closely connected with
al-Qaeda, but it's part of the same movement of Islamic extremism.  We
are now in a moment where that country, that regime which was the
birthplace of all this, is in--is tottering.  The day Neda was shot was
the day that regime lost its legitimacy. A lot of us thought the people
out on the streets were going to be pushed back into their homes by the
terror crackdown against them, and yet this week they're out again.  And
that shows that regime is incredibly fragile and dying.  And so the
question becomes, what do we do?  How do we push back against them?  Do
we try to restrict gasoline imports into Iran?  How aggressive should the
Obama administration be?"
146,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.  Well, your paper's reporting, this morning, in fact,
that a, a new set of sanctions are really being contemplated at a time
when the government appears to be distracted in Iran from pursuing its
nuclear program."
147,"MR. BROOKS:  Right.  And, and the question should be--and it's a tough
question, I don't know the answer to it.  Some people will, you know,
really impose tough sanctions, that rallies people around the regime.
Other people say they can't, they can't get gasoline, they rebel against
the regime.  To my mind, the Obama administration has not been tough
enough, especially on a moral level, in supporting the people on the
streets."
148,"MR. DIONNE:  But, you know, what's interesting about that report is that
it--the administration wants to impose the sanction against the
Revolutionary Guards.  And that's a very interesting strategy because it
sends a message to the people of Iran, ""We're not against you.  We are
against the guys who are cracking your heads, the guys who are putting
the opposition in jail."" And that could send both a political signal to
the Iranians and also have the effect of undermining the folks who are
oppressing the people of Iran."
149,MR. GREGORY:  Let...
150,"MS. GOODWIN:  It also shows, I think, that the engagement that the
administration has made with China and Russia may be paying off, because
they're more willing to think about sanctions now than they would have
been before."
151,"MR. GREGORY:  Tom, the president doesn't have the luxury of focusing on
one issue at a time, and he comes back from vacation to a crowded inbox,
as I said at, at the, the top of the program.  Healthcare reform is
within sight now, which we should point out would be a huge legislative
accomplishment for this president.  How does he get it through this final
mile?"
152,"MR. BROKAW:  Well, I talked to a very senior member of the Democratic
leadership in the House, getting ready for this weekend, and there is a
real determination to get this wrapped up as quickly as possible so the
president can have it in time for the State of the Union.  Because the
Democrats, for the next nine months, want to have a new two-stroke
engine:  jobs and fiscal responsibility.  They believe that they really
have to shift the attention of the country to that on their terms or
they're not going to do well come the fall.  When it comes to health
care, I do think that they have some serious issues before they get this
finally resolved.  I don't think there's a person in America who
completely understands what exists in both these bills. There's a lot of
fear out there that it's going to have an adverse impact on the
healthcare plans that people already have.  So I think they've got a lot
of work to make it less complex and make it much more transparent between
now and the State of the Union on January 20th."
153,"MR. GREGORY:  E.J., you can hear Republicans get ready in this, the
election year, the midterm election year..."
154,MR. DIONNE:  Hm.
155,"MR. GREGORY:  ...run against ""Obamacare,"" and ask the question, ""Are you
better off, is your job more secure than when Obama first came into
office?"" That's how the Republicans are going to be coming at the White
House and at Democrats."
156,"MR. DIONNE:  Right.  And I think that, look, if unemployment is 10
percent still in November, the Democrats are going to have a very tough
time in this election.  That's why they want to turn to this jobs agenda.
But I think the Republicans are going to make a mistake if they say, ""We
want you to vote for us because we are going to repeal this health plan.""
Because when you look at what comes into effect right away as opposed to
the stuff that takes effect four years from now, it's things that are
very popular with people.  You can put your kid on your family plan till
the kid is 26 years old.  No more rules against--you know, the insurance
companies can't cut you off if you're sick. The whole plan got
discredited in the, in the minds of some people because the legislative
process looks really awful.  And the more the focus was on the
legislative process, the more people said, ""What's going on here?"" Once
they pass a plan, you can actually talk about a plan."
157,MS. GOODWIN:  I agree with you.  I...
158,MR. DIONNE:  And then we can have a real debate about what's in the plan.
159,MR. BROOKS:  I'm not Einstein...
160,"MS. GOODWIN:  I, I, I agree with..."
161,"MR. BROOKS:  ...but most people oppose the plan.  I mean, the majority
want--don't want it to succeed.  The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll asked,
is it a good idea or bad idea?  Thirty-two percent of Americans said it's
a good idea.  And..."
162,"MS. GOODWIN:  Except, you know what, David?  When they ask you about
specific parts of it--this is why I agree with what E.J. said---is it a
good idea to be able to have pre-existing conditions and still have
insurance?  Is it a good idea to have your kid protected in that way?  Is
it a good idea to make sure that the insurance companies can't cap you?
They agree with those things.  So I think the failure has been in not
making it clear what's in the plan.  And my sense is that, once it
passes, it's an historic thing.  You don't realize all these presidents,
ever since the guy I'm living with now, Teddy Roosevelt, tried in 1912,
haven't been able to get it through.  It's what people go to Congress
for, to do something.  You know, when LBJ was asked, ""Why are you going
to do civil rights?"" he said, ""What's the presidency for?"" Obama decided
to use his capital to get this huge thing done, and I think once it's
achieved then the messiness of the process is behind us.  And then they
have to put out a campaign to tell everybody what's in this bill, just as
you were saying.  They don't know what's in this bill.  They're afraid of
this bill, but there's so many good things in it.  If they can run a
campaign like they did to get the election, to tell people what's in this
bill, it's going to be hugely popular.  That's my prediction as a
historian going backwards."
163,"MR. BROOKS:  Well, if, if it's a New Deal--if it's, if it's the New Deal,
it'll lead to a decade of, of Democratic reign.  If it's the Great
Society, it'll lead to a couple decades of Republican reign.  I mean,
the, the people like the good things in the bill.  But if you, if you
say..."
164,"MR. DIONNE:  People still like Medicare, which came in the Great Society."
165,MS. GOODWIN:  Yeah.
166,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
167,"MR. BROOKS:  Well, if you say that you want health care to take up 20
percent of GDP, 25 percent of GDP, strangle education, infrastructure,
and everything else, well, those are the parts they don't like."
168,MR. GREGORY:  Tom?
169,"MR. BROKAW:  I was going to say that in the, in the healthcare delivery
systems--and a lot of physicians in the country have been writing about
this--think that there's not enough reform in it.  And they begin with
Medicare, that trying to pay for a lot of this by cutting Medicare is not
the solution.  You've got to rearrange Medicare.  There was just a story
in The New York Times this past week about what happens at UCLA, where
they extend life no matter what the cost is, and it becomes well beyond
what is reasonable medically..."
170,MS. GOODWIN:  Except as we get older.
171,"MR. BROKAW:  ...and financially.  If we get older.  But in, for example,
at UCLA Medical Center, they spend $92,000, I think is the number, on the
last two years of a life.  At Portland, Oregon, just north of there, they
spend like $52,000, because they've got better controls on Medicare.  So
until you begin to pay for value and pay for performance, then healthcare
reform is not going to work, despite all these pieces of it."
172,"MR. GREGORY:  Here we are at the dawn of a new decade, and there's a lot
of talk about the old decade.  And there was a cartoon that, that caught
my eye that shows Uncle Sam trying to return the first decade of this
century to the returns and exchanges bureau, and the lady says, ""I'm
sorry, sir, we have rules against returning entire decades."""
173,"But, Doris, a lot made about the notion of this being a lost decade--lost
opportunities, lost wealth not just for the rich, but for Americans all
over the country with the stock market going down so far."
174,"MS. GOODWIN:  Well, you know, if you ask people Ronald Reagan's
question--""Are you better off now than you were at the beginning of the
decade?""--on so many levels the answer would be no.  We have fewer jobs,
fewer money in the stock market, we feel less safe.  There's a whole
series of markers.  And yet, on the other hand, as always happens, the
potential for renewal is in this decade.  We've looked about the global
warming thing, we're taking that seriously.  We have the first
African-American president who's been elected to the presidency.  There's
a sense of knowing we've got to get--capture leadership in green
revolution, we've got to get our country manufacturing base back so that
we can lead the world in the green.  There's a lot of good stuff, just as
bad stuff comes from a previous decade.  You know, one of the interesting
things JFK said when he first took office, he said, ""I thought that all
the world's problems were Eisenhower's fault""..."
175,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
176,"MS. GOODWIN:  ...""until I got in there and I realized, `Oh, my God, some
of them are mine,' and I'm going to leave some for my people behind us.""
So there's always a continuum, as was said earlier on the show."
177,"MR. BROKAW:  Think of that first year of John Kennedy, for example.  I
mean, he has his head handed to him by Khrushchev, we get much more
deeply involved in Vietnam, we have the Bay of Pigs going on, the Freedom
Riders are in the South beginning the rise to the civil rights movement.
And then that decade is the introduction of the assassination of the
president, the assassination of Martin Luther King, the assassination of
Robert Kennedy, the turmoil in the streets of Chicago, a war that cost us
almost 60,000 lives before the end of it.  So that is not in the distant
past, that's in my own lifetime.  Maybe not yours, David, but it was in
my lifetime."
178,"MR. GREGORY:  I wasn't going to say it.  But, but, David Brooks, then
what then becomes the narrative of this new decade, given what we've just
come off?"
179,"MR. BROOKS:  I always look at passionate outsiders.  Who are the
passionate outsiders who are going to come into the mainstream?  Because
the people with passion really can control the decade--the feminists in
the 1970s, the evangelicals in the 1980s.  And so when I look around the
world at who are the real passionate outsiders, one, the people that
we've already talked about, which are the, the democracy protesters in
Iran.  But two, and I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of them, but
the tea party people.  They have real passion.  They're now at the
outside.  If they can merge with responsible leadership and become a real
movement--there's real disgust at government, there's real disgust about
fiscal issues--they could become maybe a destructive force in the
Republican Party, maybe a positive force.  But, to me, those are the
people with real passion who may play a much larger role in the coming
decade and so forth."
180,"MR. GREGORY:  E.J., your column this week talked about the ""squandered
decade"" and how, politically, the fights in this first year of the Obama
presidency were carryovers from the previous decade and, and Bush
administration.  How do we get government to work better?"
181,"MR. DIONNE:  Well, I think that is a core question.  You know, Tom
mentioned the '60s.  And there were certain decades that loomed for
decades afterward where how you come to terms with what happened in that
decade affects politics for years to come.  And I think that there's a
whole swath of the country that decided--majority of the country--decided
in 2008, that what had come before had failed.  We were very unhappy with
the economy; we did not like, in the end, the course that President Bush
took in Iraq, that didn't look like an effective way to fight terror.
And so now the fight over Obama is really a fight among those who said we
need to turn away from the strategy of that decade vs. those who were
defending it and who have an interest in seeing President Obama fail.  I
agree with David about passionate movements, but I think the, the
question he raised about can government work, Obama's got to show that it
can because that is what will turn this kind of empty anti-government
feeling--it's just a general ""I hate government,"" it's not about
particular programs.  He's got to show government can work.  That's the
way those movements go away.  You had the same kind of opposition to FDR,
and it eventually went away."
182,"MS. GOODWIN:  You know, I think..."
183,"MR. BROKAW:  David, I really..."
184,"MS. GOODWIN:  OK, you go first."
185,"MR. BROKAW:  I was just going to say, I think that the rules of this
decade really began on 9/11 when all the old rules and all the old
expectations were shattered that day, and ever since then, we have been
living with the consequences of everything we grew up believing going
away.  We thought General Motors would be there forever, for example, and
the American car industry would do well.  We thought owning a home was
the American dream, and it is for a lot of people, but there are a lot of
people, it turns out, who couldn't own an American home.  We thought that
the lessening of financial regulations would make Wall Street more
effective.  Guess what we ended up with.  So I think that, going forward,
there will be much more attention to the government being flexible and
being--and addressing the real issues that are there.  And also there is
going to be a lot more emphasis on proportion and authenticity."
186,"MR. GREGORY:  I got, I got to make that the last word.  Thank you all
very much."
187,"One other note here.  Tom has spent the past year traveling across
America along the famed Highway 50, talking with Americans all along the
way.  And his program on all that premieres Monday, January 18th, at 8 PM
Eastern on the USA Network.  We'll preview some of those stories about
the American characters that Tom spoke to in our Take Two Web Extra with
Tom.  It will be up on our Web site this afternoon at mtp.msnbc.com."
188,And we'll be right back.

victory in Congress, could this string of key retirements turn the tide
for the party in 2010?  A live debate this morning between the two sides
on the midterm elections and the Obama agenda.  Democratic National
Committee Chairman Governor, Tim Kaine of Virginia vs.  Republican

22,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me start with those remarks by Harry Reid as being
reported in this new book, ""Game Change,"" about the 2008 race:  ""[Senator
Reid] was wowed by Obama's oratorical gifts and believed that the country
was ready to embrace a black presidential candidate, especially one such
as Obama--a `light-skinned' African-American `with no Negro dialect,
unless he wanted to have one,' as he said privately.  Reid was convinced,
in fact, that Obama's race would help him more than hurt him in a bid for
the Democratic nomination."" Senator Reid quickly apologized.  He spoke to
President Obama yesterday, who, as I mentioned, issued a statement saying
the case is closed on this, he accepts the apology."
23,"Governor Kaine, is the case closed?  Should there be a consequence for
these remarks?"
24,"GOV. KAINE:  David, I think the case is closed because President Obama
has spoken directly with the leader and accepted his apology.  The
comments were unfortunate and they were insensitive.  They were in the
context of praising the senator and acknowledging that the senator could
be a great president, but they were still insensitive.  I think Senator
Reid stepped up, acknowledged that they were wrong, apologized to the
president.  He's accepted the apology, and we're moving on."
25,"MR. GREGORY:  Michael Steele, back in 2002 Trent Lott was ousted as
majority leader for racially insensitive remarks.  He, at that point,
said that Strom Thurmond, who ran as a segregationist for president, had
he been elected president, that the country wouldn't had--have had some
of the problems over all those years.  Then state Senator Obama said at
that point that Lott ought to be ousted as majority leader.  Do you see a
difference between then and now?"
26,"MR. STEELE:  Oh, yeah, there's a big double standard here.  And the thing
about it that's, that's interesting is that when Democrats get caught
saying racist things, you know, an apology is enough.  If, if that had
been Mitch McConnell saying that about an African-American candidate for
president of the United States, trust me, this chairman and the, and the
DNC would be screaming for its head, very much as they were with Trent
Lott.  And, and, and the reality of it is racism and racist conversations
have no place today in America.  This, this term--this, you know, you
know, like he's going to pass, for example, for, for white America
because he's, you know, got this Negro dialect that he can turn on or
turn off, and he's light-skinned, that's anachronistic language that
harkens back to the 1950s and '60s, and it confirms to me a mind-set that
is out of step with where America is today. But I can assure you that if
I had, as national chairman, said that, ""Well, it's all behind us, and
he's apologized.  Let's move on,"" no one would be accepting that.  There
have to--has to be a consequence here if the standard is the one that was
set in 2002 with Trent Lott."
27,"MR. GREGORY:  And it--is the consequence that Senator Reid should step
down as majority leader?"
28,"MR. STEELE:  I believe it is.  Well, it--from my perspective, whether he
steps down today or I retire him in November, either way he will not be
the leader in 2011."
29,MR. GREGORY:  Governor Kaine?
30,"GOV. KAINE:  Well, first, the senator said--I mean, Chairman Steele said
earlier this week that the Republicans were not going to win it back.  So
Leader Reid's still going to be the leader.  But I will say, anybody
looking at Trent Lott's statements praising of somebody who had been a
pro-segregation candidate for president will see that there is no
comparison between those comments and those of Senator Reid's.  Now, the
senator did make comments that were wrong and insensitive, and he's
apologized.  But he made them in the context of promoting the candidacy,
the historic candidacy of Senator Obama."
31,"MR. GREGORY:  But--so you don't think, you don't think he should resign?"
32,GOV. KAINE:  Absolutely...
33,MR. GREGORY:  You don't think he should resign?
34,GOV. KAINE:  Absolutely not.
35,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me move on more generally to the politics of the
country and the mood of the country right now."
36,"Chairman Steele, how is the mood around the country?"
37,"MR. STEELE:  The mood of the country right now is sour.  People are
angry, they're frustrated, they're scared.  And I think you see and, and
have seen in certainly 2009 elections and you will see this year the
public standing up and saying they've had enough.  They're saying no to
more taxes, they're saying no to more government.  And as we're about to
celebrate this one-year anniversary of the administration, what do we
have?  We have no health care, we have no jobs, we have no money and we
have, oh, $13 trillion worth of debt.  That is not lost on the American
people right now, and so they're going to the polls, they're going to
their town halls, they're going to the streets of their--of the country
and they're saying, ""Enough."" And they're putting the leadership on
notice that, ""Pay attention to us.  Listen to us.  We're telling you
what, what we want and what we don't want."" And yet, this administration
and this Democratic Party has a tin ear to the fact that people out there
are hurting. We haven't created jobs, and yet..."
38,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
39,"MR. STEELE:  ...now we're going to have another conversation about jobs?
That should have been the conversation on the first day, not, you know,
the things that the, the administration's pursued."
40,"MR. GREGORY:  Chairman Kaine, it's a very difficult year to be an
incumbent party, as the Democrats are."
41,"GOV. KAINE:  Well, David, it's a challenging one.  As you know, the
history is this, that midterm elections for presidents, since 1900, the
president would normally lose about 28 House seats, four Senate seats,
lose governors races.  But the good thing about President Obama's team is
that they're not used--not--to an uphill climb.  We're going to do a lot
better than people think, for three reasons."
42,"First, this president does have a record of success.  From day one,
focused on economic recovery in ways that have cut job losses from
800,000 a month now in the last month to 80,000 a month.  We're not where
we want to be yet, but thank goodness we have arrested the free fall of
the economy and we see positive signs throughout the nation.  We're not
where we want to be yet."
43,"Second, the other side has more retirements than we have.  I know we'll
probably talk about that.  But just on these retirements this week, 14
House Republicans have announced their retirement, 10 Democrats; six
Republican senators have announced their retirements, two Democrats; four
Republican governors have announced their retirements, two Democrats.
That's going to help us."
44,"And finally, the Republicans have demonstrated that they're not ready to
lead, from saying no to everything to having an internal battle among the
party chasing Arlen Specter out, chasing Dede Scozzafava out of the
race, the Republican nominee in the congressional race in upstate New
York."
45,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, let..."
46,"GOV. KAINE:  Just this week, kicking out the Florida GOP party chair, and
many mainstream Republicans facing primary battles or censures, like
Senator Graham.  There's a civil war that's corrosive on the Republican
side that is going to enable us to do a lot better than many folks think."
47,"MR. GREGORY:  Chairman Steele, earlier this week you said you didn't
think that the Republican Party could retake the majority in Congress in
2010.  If you think President Obama's doing so poorly, why did you say
that?  Why do you believe it?"
48,"MR. STEELE:  Well, no, the, the rest of that was if we're not prepared to
do it, if we don't have principal candidates out there running as, as we
need to. And we have those candidates, we have those individuals out
there who are already making a mark.  Look, I'm excited about the fact
that we're, we're going to engage in a, in a very healthy battle and
campaign this year.  Look at what we did in 2009.  We won New Jersey
governorship.  We won the governorship of your state.  You know, the
reality of it is we have candidates with ideas that people want to pay
attention to and follow.  Right now in Massachusetts Scott Brown is doing
a valiant effort by listening to the people of Massachusetts and talking
to them about commonsense agendas that empower them from the bottom up,
not government down."
49,MR. GREGORY:  Well...
50,"MR. STEELE:  So the, the reality of it remains this."
51,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, I just want to be clear."
52,"MR. STEELE:  This administration has, this administration's put some
things on the table that have turned America off.  The question isn't
whether the Republicans take the House back, it's whether or not the
Democrats can keep it.  And right now they can't."
53,"MR. GREGORY:  But let me, let me, let me just be clear here."
54,"GOV. KAINE:  David, if I, if I could just..."
55,"MR. GREGORY:  Hold on, Governor Kaine."
56,GOV. KAINE:  OK.
57,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me be clear.  Chairman Steele, do you think Republicans
will regain control of Congress, yes or no?"
58,"MR. STEELE:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  The rate we're going now, the,
the, the ground game we're putting in place, we absolutely can take the
Congress back this, this year.  There will not be a 60-seat majority for
the Democrats come January of next year.  There's parity that's going to
be created, and the, and the Republicans are going to create that parity."
59,"GOV. KAINE:  David, let me go right back to what Chairman Steele said
earlier this week.  He said that the Republicans were not going to take
Congress and he said why.  He said it's because they're not ready to
lead.  We see that over and over again, a philosophy that just says no to
everything that stands by and watches..."
60,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, I want to get, I want to get into some specific
issues."
61,"GOV. KAINE:  ...a country in free fall is not what the American public
wants."
62,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, hold on, let me--I want to interject some
specific issues and have some, some narrow or targeted responses on
particular issues."
63,"You'll hear from Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in a few minutes,
Governor Kaine.  One of the things he says, and, by the way, he was an
early supporter of the notion of healthcare reform; the White House was
relying on him.  He says that the burden that healthcare reform that's
coming down the pike will, will take the burden it places on states is
onerous, that it's akin to beating up on a state like California, which
has a $20 billion shortfall, because of the mandate to expand the
Medicaid rules, roles, including some other demands on the states.
You're a governor.  Do you understand what he's saying?"
64,"GOV. KAINE:  David, I do.  But I've looked at this very carefully in
connection with the Virginia budget, and I think what is often missed is
that there's going to be some cost to state to expand Medicaid, but then
that will take huge financial burdens out of state budgets that we're
incurring right now to take care of those who are uninsured.  Virginia is
an example.  We have over a million, 1.2 million Virginians that are
uninsured, and we spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year to
take care of them in the emergency rooms for serious emergency treatment
that could have been prevented under this health reform bill.  For
example, preventive care is no co-pay.  So we're going to move toward
prevention, state budgets are going to save dollars that we're spending
now to try to pull people back from the brink of sickness that they
needn't be suffering under with a better healthcare system.  I think..."
65,MR. GREGORY:  Chair...
66,"GOV. KAINE:  I think Virginia stands to benefit, much as do other
American states, from finally passing meaningful healthcare reform."
67,"MR. GREGORY:  Chairman Steele, do you think it will help Republicans in
the fall to campaign against Obama's healthcare reform?"
68,"MR. STEELE:  Absolutely, because it's a boondoggle.  I mean, it's loaded
with taxes, it's loaded with government intrusion and regulations, it's
loaded with, you know, debt that is going to be passed on to future
generations. Like Governor Schwarzenegger, Governor Kaine is passing on a
$4 billion deficit to his, to his successor.  Where do you think that
deficit comes from? It comes from the weight that's put on states by
unfunded mandates from the federal government.  If you bought into
the--to this healthcare plan in the first place when you signed on took
some of the, some of the early money, there were strings attached to
that.  You have states that are now going to be burdened in the future to
fund programs that the federal government said, ""We'll do today, but you
carry the weight tomorrow."" This is the reality that a lot of governors
around the country are facing, and you're going to layer on top of that a
healthcare boondoggle, an experiment that no one can tell you what it's
actually going to cost."
69,GOV. KAINE:  David...
70,"MR. STEELE:  We're now hearing that it's, ""Oh, it's going to be a little
bit more than we thought it was going to be."""
71,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
72,GOV. KAINE:  David...
73,MR. STEELE:  People realize what's going on here.
74,"GOV. KAINE:  ...let me, let me focus on it, because I think you've asked
an excellent question.  Will the campaigns of 2010 be heavily focused on
health care?  You will have the Republican Party campaigning to repeal
this historic health bill that will pass.  You'll have me and my team out
promoting it.  I want to have that campaign.  I want to face a Republican
Party chair in leadership that says ""No, we need to go back and let
insurance companies kick people off who are sick."" I want them to go
explain why 47 million Americans are uninsured and why the costs will
continue to escalate to break..."
75,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
76,GOV. KAINE:  ...the bank of middle income families and businesses.
77,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, I want to..."
78,GOV. KAINE:  Let them defend that status quo.
79,MR. GREGORY:  Let me leave healthcare there for a minute.
80,"MR. STEELE:  And we'll defend, we'll defend..."
81,"MR. GREGORY:  Gentlemen, let me leave healthcare there for a minute.  I
have a couple minutes left, a couple of issues I want to address."
82,"Chairman Steele, you have a new book out, the 12 steps to take on the
Obama agenda and defeat the Obama agenda."
83,MR. STEELE:  Yes.
84,"MR. GREGORY:  And you talked about making it very clear that there'll be
penalties for certain conservatives who don't espouse conservative
values. But your leadership has come under some question this week.
Whether it's statements that you've made..."
85,MR. STEELE:  Yeah.
86,"MR. GREGORY:  ...like earlier in the week saying you wouldn't take back
control of Congress.  You picked a fight with Rush Limbaugh earlier in
the year.  You said abortion was a choice.  People have questioned you
taking money for speeches and even taking money for writing the book, and
you said this week, ""If you don't want me in the job, fire me, but until
then shut up,"" to your Republican critics.  Are you an effective leader
of the Republican Party?"
87,"MR. STEELE:  I, I am.  I think I am a passionate leader of this party.
I'm a, I'm a grassroots guy.  I grew up here in the streets of D.C.  At
17 decided to become a Republican, and I've been fighting that fight ever
since.  I believe passionately in those principles that have--that drew
me to this party.  And I, and I, I get angry sometimes when we walk away
from those principles.  I get angry and frustrated when I see those
principles not being regarded because they have been the foundation for
generations.  And the reality of it is, as chairman, I've raised $80
million this year.  I've, I've won two gubernatorial races that no one
thought I could, could win, one in his backyard.  I, I, I've got 370,000
new donors to the party.  I've got $8 million cash on hand when the
budget I inherited said I would have zero, I would have debt.  I have no
debt.  They have debt.  I have the same amount of money, cash on hand, as
my partner here who had the White House, both houses of Congress, $8
million, going into this year.  So I think overall I'm doing OK."
88,"MR. GREGORY:  Final question, Chairman Steele.  Is the Republican Party
guilty of politicizing terrorism right now?"
89,"MR. STEELE:  Oh, absolutely not.  Oh my goodness, no."
90,"GOV. KAINE:  No, David, they are."
91,"MR. STEELE:  No, absolutely not."
92,GOV. KAINE:  That's all they're doing on these terrorism issues...
93,"MR. STEELE:  The reality of it is, look..."
94,GOV. KAINE:  ...is trying to politicize the fundraising...
95,"MR. GREGORY:  Let Chairman Steele, let Chairman Steele--hold on.
Governor, governor, let Chairman Steele answer the question and then you
respond."
96,GOV. KAINE:  OK.  Great.
97,"MR. STEELE:  Absolutely not.  Dick Cheney has it dead right.  This
administration has not put out a clear vision of how they're going to
handle national security and what--were going to, were going to
stop--close Gitmo, not done.  We're surprised and amazed that the dots
weren't connected on what happened on December 25th.  The American people
don't trust the direction this is going.  If you can't call a thing what
is, and that is terrorism, people wonder if you know what to do with it.
And that's where we are right now, and it's not the place to be."
98,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor Kaine, 30 seconds."
99,"GOV. KAINE:  The president's approach to terrorism has been praised by
many of the Bush administration leaders across the board from the day
he's come into office.  When the incident happened on the air flight into
Detroit, it was only a matter of days before Republican leaders were
trying to use it in fundraising letters, making all kinds of outrageous
claims such as the president never uses the word terror.  As you know,
that's ridiculous.  He uses it all the time in speeches.  They've been
claiming that the way that this, this recent suspect is being treated is
contrary to what should happen for national security.  The case is being
treated exactly the same way..."
100,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
101,"GOV. KAINE:  ...the Bush administrated--administration treated the
Richard Ride--Richard Reid case."
102,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
103,"GOV. KAINE:  And so this is an instance where the president's doing the
right thing.  The Republicans are just looking for an excuse to raise
money and politicize it.  This president is going to unify Americans and
keep us safe..."
104,MR. GREGORY:  We're...
105,GOV. KAINE:  ...than play political games.
106,"MR. GREGORY:  We're going to leave it there.  The debate will continue in
this hot political year."
107,"Both of you, thank you very much.  Chairman Steele..."
108,"MR. STEELE:  Thank you, David."
109,"MR. GREGORY:  ...and Chairman Kaine.  We will come back after this.  And
have more with Chairman Steele, I should point out, in our MEET THE PRESS
Take Two Web extra.  It's up this afternoon.  You can also read excerpts
of ""Right Now: A 12-Step Program for Defeating the Obama Agenda."" Plus,
look for updates from me throughout the week.  It's all at our Web site,
mtp.msnmbc.com."
110,"And up next, yesterday I sat down here in California with an exclusive
interview with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.  We'll talk about how he
plans to tackle California's massive budget deficit.  Plus, our political
roundtable with NBC's Andrea Mitchell and Chuck Todd, only here on MEET
THE PRESS."
111,(Announcements)
112,"MR. GREGORY:  Our exclusive interview from yesterday with Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger here in California after this brief commercial break."
113,(Announcements)
114,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  And we're back with our special broadcast from
California."
115,"Governor Schwarzenegger, good morning."
116,GOV. ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (R-CA):  How are you today?
117,"MR. GREGORY:  It's always, it's always nice to come home to California.
Thank you for having us."
118,GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  Absolutely.
119,"MR. GREGORY:  This has been a big week for you with your State of the
State message and a new budget.  And 2010 begins in a challenging place
for a lot of states, including California, in this economy.  Do you feel
like the worst is over?"
120,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  I think that economically the worst is over.  I--we
see a little comeback when it comes to job creation.  We see also that,
you know, homes have been sold again and that home sales are up, and I
think that very soon you will see construction again and, and new homes
and so on.  But when it comes to the financial crisis that California is
in, I think we're not out of the woods yet, as I said in my State of the
State and in my budget speech, in that we still have a tough road ahead
of us.  And this year is one of those tough years."
121,"MR. GREGORY:  And for the country as well.  When you think, not just
about California, but the country and economic recovery, what do you
think is the biggest threat to that recovery?  Is it unemployment?"
122,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  I think that we have to get the economy back.  I
think that we have to have money available, loans available so businesses
can expand again and people can buy homes.  I think that we just have to
get the jobs back as quickly as possible.  That's why we have tax
incentives for people that want to buy new or used homes.  And we just
want to do everything that we can as a state and as a country to
stimulate the economy.  That's the key thing because I think that the
worst is when people lose their jobs and they have to go home to their
family and say, you know, ""I have no more money.  We cannot provide for
the family,"" and so on.  Or when both of the parents lose their jobs, it
gets even tougher.  And that's as--is the case in a lot of families.  And
so we have to do everything that we can.  That's government's
responsibility to stimulate the economy and to help."
123,"MR. GREGORY:  The federal government is spending a lot of money in
stimulus, preparing to do so on healthcare reform, if that gets passed.
And there's a lot of talk about taxes, whether taxes will be necessary on
the national level, or even when you're facing a $20 billion shortfall.
David Ignatius wrote something, a columnist for The Washington Post, that
caught my attention, and he wrote, ""What worries me, looking ahead,""
thinking about the whole country, ""is what might be called the
`Californiazation' of America - the growing tendency of our political
system to make promises in social spending programs that it isn't
prepared to pay for with tax increases."" Think about California.  How can
you stick to a position, as you do, that tax increases are not the way to
go?"
124,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  Well, first of all, we have no option because if
you do the tax increases, you immediately kind off stifle the economy.
So right now, where we try to get the--where we see that the economy's
bottomed out and it has a chance now to come back, to go in now, to hit
the state with more taxes will be the wrong thing to do.  So what you
want to do is you want to do the opposite.  You want to go and put money
into the economy and you want to go and give tax incentives for
businesses, for new hires, as we did, or for retraining people or for
homebuyers' tax credits and so on.  So I think that it would be a big
mistake.  I think that the, the thing that politicians should not do is
promise things they can't keep in that they have no funding mechanism to
go and follow through with those promises.  Like, for instance, in
California, with the pensions, the public employees' pension.  I mean,
it's a disaster because in the, in the late '90s, they were promised
things that there's no way the state can keep those promises.  And that's
why I said that we have got to get Democrats and Republicans together
and, and fix this problem, because right now we are paying already more
than $3 billion towards the pensions, and eventually that amount is going
to go up to $10 billion. That's money that's being taken away from very
important programs--universities, schools, health care and all those kind
of other things."
125,"MR. GREGORY:  When you think about the federal government's budget, which
doesn't have to be brought into--to alignment the way a state budget,
like California's, do you think taxes have to go up to pay for stimulus,
to pay for health care?"
126,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  I think that the government has to live within its
means.  And, of course, the big advantage that the federal government has
is they can ran up--run up those deficits and they can print more money,
whereas the state can't.  And I try to tell the people in California,
when you have $85 billion in revenues available, that's all you can
spend, that's end of that, even though they may want to spend $104 [billion] or $105
billion.  And so you have to make the necessary cuts because we've got to
live within our means.  We cannot print more money in this state.  We
cannot go and run up those deficits, as the federal government does."
127,"MR. GREGORY:  You called some of the cuts that you put forward in your
budget draconian cuts, by your own admission."
128,GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  Mm-hmm.
129,"MR. GREGORY:  One of the things you said so strongly is the federal
government has got to come to California's aid.  What do you mean?"
130,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  Well, it's not so much coming to our aid.  The
federal government owes us billions of dollars.  You see, there's a
difference.  I mean, in California, one's got 94 cents to the dollar that
we're putting in on federal taxes.  Now we only get 78 cents.  But you
have places like, for instance, Alaska that gets $1.86.  You have New
Mexico that gets $2.03.  So we are subsidizing those states.  And that is
the thing that is unfair.  So what we're saying to the federal
government, ""Look, you are responsible for our border security.  You're
responsible for immigration and for all of those kind of things that, you
know, you--if you fix those problems, if you help us, you know, with the
incarceration of undocumented immigrant, which costs us almost a billion
dollars, yeah, then we can talk.  But right now, you're not wanting to
pay any of those things."" So it is unfair that we are paying in $1 and
getting back 78 cents on the dollar.  And so we tried to fix that, and
it's not a bailout at all.  It's just being fair, and it's federal
fairness, not federal bailout."
131,MR. GREGORY:  What about the stimulus?  Has it helped California?
132,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  I think the stimulus was very helpful to
California, and I think that--I was a big supporter of the stimulus
package.  I think they have given us money, and--if it has to do with
transportation or with high technology and with all kinds of different
things, with our universities and so on, so we were very appreciative.
But it's one-time money.  One should always know the difference between
one-time money and ongoing money.  One-time money, that's here today,
gone tomorrow.  Ongoing money, when I talk about, you know, increasing
the level from 78 cents to 90 cents, that's an ongoing thing.  Or when we
talk about health care, that you have health care where we are owed
billions of dollars in health care, that's ongoing.  So we want to make
those adjustments with the federal government and work with them so that
it's more fair."
133,"MR. GREGORY:  What happens if California doesn't get the money that you
feel it deserves from the federal government?  What then?"
134,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  Well, first of all, you know, I never really think
so much about the Option B because it's a loser's attitude.  I think you
always have to just think about--even though it has been difficult up
until now to get that money, we've been fighting for it for six years,
but we never give up.  And it's just like with the redistricting reform.
Journalists always ask me, they say, ""Well, wait a minute.  It has lost
now five times.  Why are you back the sixth time with redistricting
reform?  Don't you get it that the people vote no?"" And I said, ""No, I
never give up."" I come from the sports background.  Just because you
didn't lift the weight one time, did you give up, never try it again?
No.  There's no such thing.  So we're going to be back."
135,"And then in, in redistricting reform the sixth time, we won.  And the
same is with this.  We will never give up.  We continue pushing.  This
time we're going to go back with the four legislative leaders of
California, Democrats and Republicans alike, and keep pushing and talking
to the federal government and letting them know that it is unfair the way
the money's being distributed right now.  And so we also will inspire and
push extra hard the California congressional delegation, the bipartisan
delegation, because they're not being--representing us really well in
this case.  I mean, you know, if you think about that the Senate just
voted for a healthcare bill that is saying basically that California
should pay for Nebraska so that Nebraska never has to pay any extra
money, and we have to..."
136,MR. GREGORY:  To expand the Medicaid rolls?
137,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  To expand the Medicaid.  And so if--we have to pay
$3, $4 billion extra for those states?"
138,MR. GREGORY:  You said the president should rethink healthcare reform.
139,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  Absolutely, because that's not healthcare reform,
to go and to put that extra burden, billions of dollars, on other states,
especially on California.  Just because we're the best state in the world
and the best place in the world and we are the most diversified economy
and everyone wants to come to California is no reason to beat up on
California and to always ask for more money from California."
140,MR. GREGORY:  Do--is that how you...
141,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  I think it's time for the federal government to go
and do--take care of us."
142,"MR. GREGORY:  Is that how you think about healthcare reform as something
that ultimately would beat up on California?"
143,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  Yes, it is.  Right now it is.  And I just cannot
imagine why we would have, like I said, you know, for instance, you know,
our senators and congressional people, how they would vote for something
like that where they're representing Nebraska and not us.  And by the
way, as I said in my State of the State, that's the biggest rip-off.  I
mean, that is against the law to buy a vote.  I mean..."
144,"MR. GREGORY:  You're talking about Senator Nelson, who got..."
145,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  As Senator Nelson.  That's like buying a vote to
say, ""Hey, it's--I'm going""..."
146,"MR. GREGORY:  The federal government will pay for their Medicaid
expansion."
147,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  ""I'm holding out my vote unless I get some extra
kind of benefits here."" I mean, if you do that in Sacramento, you know,
you will be sued.  It is illegal to do that, to buy votes."
148,MR. GREGORY:  Can I ask you a couple more California issues?
149,GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  Yeah.
150,"MR. GREGORY:  One of the things you talked about that got a lot of
attention is your pledge to move money out of the state budget from
prisons into higher education.  I don't have to tell you, the, the
University of California system has raised fees for students.  What is
the future of education in California?"
151,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  I think the future of education in California is
great. I think we still have the best university system in the world.
The key thing is that we reform education from kindergarten through 14,
especially kindergarten through 12th.  Because it is inexcusable for what
we had up until now, and we were fighting to change that for years now,
and finally we were able to change it.  Just the other day I signed
legislation to reform education.  It's inexcusable that children get
stuck in low-performing schools and you cannot get them out without the
school principal's permission.  Of course the school principal will never
give you the permission, because it will be--he will be losing money if
he lets a kid go out.  So they are stranded--they're strapped there.  As
I said, it was like a chain in the exit door--on the exit doors.  And now
we finally changed that.  Or, for instance, that parents cannot be
involved in the schools, cannot be involved in which direction a school
or education should go.  Now they have, with that reform, they have a
chance to turn low-performing schools or failing schools into charter
schools or close the school down or move the kids out of the school or
fire the school principal or teachers and so on and so forth.  So those
are the kind of things, those are the kind of reforms we need to do.  And
I'm glad that finally both parties got together and created those reforms
that we have been fighting for for years.  And here's a good example of a
good relationship with the federal government, because the Obama
administration was very instrumental--Arne Duncan, the Education
secretary, to push the states to say, ""Here's $4.3 billion for you guys.
You can apply and compete for this money."" And we can get $700 million,
so that kind of put it over the top.  So there, there was, you know, the
federal government very helpful in this."
152,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you a little bit about President Obama.  Do you
think he's doing a good enough job keeping America safe?"
153,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  I think that he's doing everything that he can.  I
think that, you know, Democrats a lot of times get the rap, you know,
they're not strong on security and all of those kinds of things.  I think
that he has talked about the issues, I think that he's been fighting for
the issues.  This was an unfortunate situation of what happened over
Christmas, and I think that it's a total failure in the communication
within the departments.  Let--when you look back, all of the instances
that are happening, it's always been to say, ""Well, we, we, we had
everything in place, but we didn't pass on--the dots were not connected,""
or something like that.  It's not like the president has done something
wrong, or because he was in Hawaii or anything else.  It's nothing to do
with that at all.  What it has to do with is just simply they didn't
connect the dots.  Within the agencies, within the airport authorities
and Homeland Securities and the CIA and everyone else, they just don't
connect the dots."
154,"And we have--we had this problem before we started creating Homeland
Security also here in California.  Where California, the law enforcement
did not really communicate well with the FBI.  They didn't want to give
them certain information, and the FBI didn't want to give information to
law enforcement, all of this, all this territorial fighting going on.
And I think that that has to get--we have to get rid of that problem and
connect the dots.  Other than that, I will say we have very smart people
in the leadership.  It's just working together is always the hardest
thing to do."
155,"MR. GREGORY:  Working together.  As you come to the, the last year of
your tenure as governor, where do you fit in the Republican Party of
today?"
156,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  I'm a reformer.  I'm an independent reformer.  I
came into this job here saying that I want, want to be the people's
governor, not the Republican Party's governor, but the people's governor.
I want to represent Democrats and Republicans.  I want to do everything
that I can to bring Democrats and Republicans together.  That's why I've
been talking so much about post-partisanship, bipartisanship or none
partisanship.  I think it's extremely important, the action is, to bring
both of the parties together and to look at what they can do together
rather than to just talk about what they want to fight over.  Let's do it
together.  Let's go in the beginning of the year and say, ""Here are the
things that need to be done,"" and then get them to work together on those
things."
157,"We, in California, even though California is known as a state that is not
governable--it is very hard to govern in California, probably the
toughest state to govern in the United States, but still we got a lot of
things done. I mean, I'm very proud--when you look--I always run around
with this list, David.  And I put this down:  workers compensation
reform, done; budget reform, not done.  We still have to fight for that.
You know, rebuilding our levees, rebuilding our roads, rebuilding our
schools, more affordable housing, rebuilding our prisons, water
infrastructure, those things were done.  But then tax reform was not
done.  You know, campaign finance reform was not done. Open primaries was
not done.  So, you know, I think that we have a lot of things we got
done, even though Democrats and Republicans fight.  But I think it is
much easier when people take party out of the way.  And I know it is very
hard to do, but you got to be a servant to the people, not to your party."
158,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you think the, the Republican Party is doing that of
today, nationally?"
159,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  I think both of the parties are not doing that
because it is so political.  It's more--they're thinking more about the
party than about the people.  And I think that as soon as both parties
come together and have regular meetings and say, ""What can we accomplish
together,"" rather than just worrying about, ""How do we get elected?"" and
""How do we get more people elected for the Republican Party?"" and how to
get more elected for the Democratic Party, all of this--I know it's part
of politics to do that.  But I think that we should tone that down and
lift up of what is important, really, and for the people.  Look, this
country need to rebuild itself.  We are still living off the Eisenhower
era and off the Roosevelt era when they built the thousands of bridges
and the thousands of government buildings and the roads, the highway
system and all of those things.  What's the new thing that we're
building?  We haven't built anything in decades.  We need a high speed
rail. We need new infrastructure.  We need to think about it because we
have countries like China and Europe that are very fast gaining on us and
surpassing us.  So we got to get our act together and really make this
country kind of live in the 21st century, not be with the infrastructure
in the 20th century."
160,"MR. GREGORY:  As you look at the political landscape nationally, given
your views about the party, do you think the Republican Party's poised
for some big gains in this election year?"
161,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  Without any doubt.  But not because some miracle
was happening that they did or that the Democrats didn't do.  That's--by
nature, you always see that; that, you know, there's a huge momentum--two
years ago it was a huge momentum for the Democratic Party because the
Republicans were in charge for so, so many years.  And they've done a
good job, the Republicans. But it--the momentum of swinging the other
way, and so the Democrats got all the votes.  So now I think the pendulum
is coming back and it's going the other way, and I think that the
Republicans are really going to benefit this year from that.  And, you
know, they will have then a chance to come up with some good ideas and
how to go in the right direction for the country."
162,"MR. GREGORY:  Final question:  What's ahead for Arnold Schwarzenegger?
Is it politics or is it Hollywood?"
163,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  I don't even think about my next move at all.  I'm
thinking about this year.  Because there's so much, so, so much
opportunity this year in tax reform and budget reform, and to really move
the state forward in the various different areas that we need to move the
state forward and bring in both of the parties together and to get our
infrastructure, the water infrastructure passed.  (Loud noise off camera)
Pay no attention, it's just a little earthquake."
164,"MR. GREGORY:  When you speak, things happen.  Yeah."
165,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  See, see, in California, when there's a noise, the
governor never shakes or worries about it because earthquakes happen all
the time."
166,"MR. GREGORY:  Right, right.  I'm an L.A. guy.  You think I would have..."
167,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  You're an--from L.A., exactly.  That's right,
exactly. But anyway, so that's the bottom line.  I am not thinking about
myself, I'm thinking about the state.  That's the key thing.  And then
when I'm finished, then I can always think about myself."
168,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Will you run for political office again?
169,"GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  Well, you never say never.  But, I mean, you know,
right now I have no plans, period."
170,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor Schwarzenegger, thank you very much."
171,GOV. SCHWARZENEGGER:  Thank you.
172,MR. GREGORY:  Appreciate it.
173,"And coming next, a look at the 2010 political landscape.  Plus, the
president's priorities for the coming year and his plans to keep the
nation safe after the attempted Christmas Day terror plot.  Insights from
our roundtable, NBC's Andrea Mitchell and Chuck Todd join us here in Los
Angeles after this brief station break."
174,(Announcements)
175,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  And we're back with our special edition of MEET THE
PRESS from California.  And joining us now, our chief foreign affairs
correspondent, Andrea Mitchell, and our political director and chief
White House correspondent, Chuck Todd."
176,"Thanks both of you for coming out here.  And you heard Governor
Schwarzenegger, he is on the front line of what a lot of states are going
through, which is a 2010 that looks a lot like 2009, which is horrendous
when it comes to their budget."
177,"And, Chuck Todd, you ask him about healthcare reform, he is not happy
about what appears to be coming down the pike."
178,"MR. CHUCK TODD:  He, he was not, and that should actually have the White
House very frustrated a little bit.  They've actually counted on
Schwarzenegger being one of the few Republicans that they can get to
stand behind him, behind the stimulus, behind some other things that
they've tried to do.  And here he was just hitting them hard over this
deal they cut with Senator Ben Nelson.  I mean, you could see a vein pop
in Schwarzenegger's neck.  Very upset, this idea that somehow Nebraska's
going to get exempted from any new federal government Medicaid mandate
costs, while the other 49 states have to pay for it, and California in
particular.  Look, this budget problem is going to be what the bank
bailout was in '09 for, for President Obama, the state bailouts could be
in 2010 for him.  This could be the big thing that nobody's going to
like, everybody's going to say is unpopular, but maybe the government
will have no choice but to do it."
179,"MR. GREGORY:  And, and he talked about health care sort of akin to
beating up on California at a time when it wants billions of dollars in
repayment from the federal government."
180,"MS. ANDREA MITCHELL:  Here you've got a Republican governor who is
nonpartisan.  He was defending the president on a lot of other things,
the terror war, but basically saying that the Democratic senators and
representatives from California should not have voted for this.  Now Ben
Nelson backing off, saying that they should do a fix where every state
gets their full Medicaid bill paid for.  That's another $25 billion to
$27 billion. They've got a real problem here, and they were counting on
governors like Ed Rendell from Pennsylvania going out and trying to drum
up support for health care.  They're sending Bill Clinton to the House
Democratic caucus the end of this week trying to get him to do what he
did in the Senate side, ""Vote for this or you will lose next year as we
lost in 1994 in the midterms."""
181,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Chuck, here, here the president faces unemployment at
10 percent.  This week more jobs lost, it stays unchanged at over 10
percent. Mark Zandi, who's an economist who--with Moody's
Economy.com--the White House consulted with him--he says unemployment
will go up to 10.8 percent by October.  The president wants to fight the
deficit, but you've got states like California and other states saying,
""Hey, we need more stimulus.  We need more federal help here,"" even
though Governor Schwarzenegger says it's not a bailout."
182,"MR. TODD:  Well, right, he did say that.  But, look, they are working on
a second stimulus.  The White House just is afraid to call it that,
right?  It's this about $200 billion, $250 billion.  It would be some
transportation things, some different things to just try to boost things
along a little bit. But they're going to have no choice.  This state
budget crisis, I think, is something folks don't appreciate these--most
of these states--look, as Governor Schwarzenegger said, he can't print
money.  He's got no choice.  They can't run deficits, they have these,
they have these constitutional mandates to balance their budgets and all
of these big states are going to get hit. And the thing is, when you're,
when you're hearing about school days getting shorter, when you're
hearing about school years getting shorter, boy, that is just politically
so unpopular.  So you can just see how the pressure gets applied to
Washington, to Congress.  It's not going to be popular, but they're going
to feel they have no choice."
183,"MR. GREGORY:  And, you know, Andrea, it's 2010, it's an election year,
and a lot of people are looking up and saying, ""Government isn't
working."" That's what Barack Obama ran on."
184,"MS. MITCHELL:  And so you not only have the change hasn't worked in the
perceptions of a lot of people with this high unemployment.  And the real
unemployment rate, many say, is 17.3 percent.  People have given up,
they're no longer even trying to get jobs.  That's even worse.  But that
there's a whole anti-incumbent fervor out there, and there are more
Democrats at stake than Republicans.  So the Democratic Party is facing
the, the reality that in 2010, if it doesn't start to change, they are
going to feel the anger, the anger that the tea party advocates really
epitomize."
185,"MR. TODD:  And, you know, really quickly, David, watching your interview
with Governor Schwarzenegger, it reminded me it's almost as like could
that be President Obama in six years?  You saw this frustration in
Governor Schwarzenegger.  He came in on the recall effort.  One could
argue it was sort of a precursor of this tea party movement, this idea
that people are sick and tired of government not working here in
California.  They said, ""You know what?  We're going, we're going to
actually recall the governor,"" and it was unprecedented at the time.
""We're going to bring in this outsider who really thinks he can just
change everything, bring in a new face."" And he's--you saw him.  He whips
out his list, the only..."
186,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
187,"MR. TODD:  ...it's only about half done, and you see that that was what
President Obama tapped into was, candidate Obama, this idea he's going to
be a new face, he's going to be able to do all these things and bring the
parties together in a way that can't be done.  And I think in his first
year he's probably going to have this list.  And you wonder is--does that
go to what your question was, which is government--maybe these places are
becoming less governable."
188,"MR. GREGORY:  And Governor Schwarzenegger said, you know, the problem is
you say you're going to do something and then you do it and it's
unpopular.  Look what President Obama has had to do in terms of bailouts,
Wall Street, the auto companies.  He's had to do things.  Now, there's a
debate about whether he should have done all of those things, but he, he
takes unpopular positions because of the crisis, and that's what he faces
about whether government is ultimately making things better."
189,"MR. TODD:  Well, and that--and then politically the White House will say,
""Look, you know, if we'd taken a poll we wouldn't have bailed out GM.  We
know that that's unpopular."""
190,MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But he had to do that.
191,"MR. TODD:  Over time they think that as long as he's got the personal
credibility still with the public, they may be disappointed in all of
these things that he's doing, but that somehow this personal credibility
and that if--when the aircraft carrier finally turns that they think
maybe he'll get some credit from that.  But..."
192,"MR. GREGORY:  So let's talk about the political landscape then, Andrea.
This week the announcement of some prominent retirements.  Chris Dodd in
Connecticut, he faced a tough race.  Byron Dorgan in North Dakota.
Governors as well.  Democratic governors in the Mountain West where
Democrats were making such gains, they're now saying they're not going to
run.  What does it mean?"
193,"MS. MITCHELL:  Well, certainly the Byron Dorgan decision in North Dakota
was a stomach-punch because they're not going to be able to hold that
seat most likely, especially if the popular Republican Governor John
Hoeven runs.  Chris Dodd's decision was actually a blessing for the
Democrats because they were going to have to write off that seat.  He was
running so far behind in his race, and now they could be competitive if
the, you know, fairly popular veteran attorney general turns out to be on
the stump as he has been as attorney general.  So the Democrats could
hold on to that seat.  But it taps into what you were talking about.
There is a feeling of--there was so much promise and hope only a year
ago.  And now, because of continuing economic woes, all of the bailouts,
the problems on the terror front, government is not working the way
people expected it to."
194,"MR. GREGORY:  And I, and I talked to a White House adviser, Chuck, this
week who said the problem for this president with independent voters is
that feeling that, ""Hey, I may believe in this guy, but he can't solve
these huge problems."" The debt, you know, government working overall, you
know, Wall Street, he can't prevent the little guy from getting hurt by
all these forces."
195,"MR. TODD:  Well, and it's--there's this snowball effect.  You say what
these retirements mean, and, you know, individually the White House was
trying to push back saying, ""Well, look, the Dodd thing is a blessing,""
and politically it is.  And the Dorgan thing, ""Well, he was going to lose
anyway had the popular Republican governor run.  And Ritter, he was
running a bad race. We're now going to get a better candidate there if
the mayor of Denver runs."" And you can explain all that away, but it does
lead to this idea that, you know, these guys would be running if they
thought they were going to win."
196,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
197,"MR. TODD:  I mean, and the fact is the landscape stinks, and it is
because you have a combination of things.  You have Democratic base not
fired up the way they were in 2006 and 2008.  Independents, which you
just mentioned about that the White House realizes, they're disappointed.
Now, the question is, do they show up and suddenly vote with the
Republicans, which then would create a Republican wave and a tsunami and
they probably would take control of everything.  Or do they just not show
up at all out of frustration at the entire system?"
198,"MR. GREGORY:  Now let's--as we talk about Republicans a little bit,
because Republicans can't necessarily take all of this to the bank.  If
you look at the map that will show of pickup opportunities, eight
legitimate Republican pickup opportunities.  Run through that list, and
then look at the Democrats."
199,"MR. TODD:  Well, in the Senate.  And you do have these, these eight
races. Look, they feel very good about some of them that are
environmentally driven, which is like Arkansas, Blanche Lincoln.  This is
a state that voted in huge numbers for McCain.  Obama did very poorly
there.  You have all the appointed Senate seats that they feel
like--three of the four, they feel like they have a good shot at, which
is Joe Biden's Senate seat in Delaware, especially if his son doesn't end
up running.  He still hasn't formally announced.  The Byron Dorgan
retirement, that has people worried that people like Beau Biden will say,
""Well, jeez, if he's having second thoughts, maybe I will."" But Colorado,
appointment there of Michael Bennet, a political novice, not gone well.
Illinois, they don't have any A-list Democrats there running in that
primary.  It's going to be kind of a messy primary.  That's Barack
Obama's Senate seat.  So you put all of those together, and you see why
Republicans think they can pick four or five Senate seats up.  The
problem Republicans have, though, is that they have their own
retirements.  They had Kit Bond in Missouri, they had the Ohio retirement
of George Voinovich, they have Judd Gregg in New Hampshire.  So they have
their own vulnerability.  So them having these huge gains seems a little
bit out of the realm."
200,"MS. MITCHELL:  And, you know, what--you saw what happened in New York
state just in that congressional district.  Which Republican Party do
they belong to?  Which Republican shows up?  Arnold Schwarzenegger, more
than anyone else, shows you the different kind of Republican who doesn't
want the partisanship, who isn't willing to just attack Barack Obama on
any given question, who would point out that on intelligence and the war
on terror, that he's doing the best that he can."
201,MR. TODD:  Schwarzenegger couldn't win a Republican primary right now.
202,MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But...
203,"MR. TODD:  That kind of Republican cannot win a Republican primary
anywhere in the country."
204,"MS. MITCHELL:  But that, that tells you..."
205,"MR. GREGORY:  But the Republicans are still in some disarray about what
they want their party to be."
206,MS. MITCHELL:  Exactly.
207,"MR. GREGORY:  And you had the chairman of the party saying this week that
he didn't think they could retake the control of Congress."
208,"MR. TODD:  Well, they're trying to embrace the tea party movement.  This
is fascinating in that they, they want to embrace it on one hand, but
then you have the establishment in Washington nervous about them at the
same time because, you know, you do wonder, are they eating their own,
right?  And we look at this Florida Senate primary as going to be sort of
front and center of the tea party movement vs.  the establishment, got
the popular governor, Charlie Crist, a moderate, Marco Rubio, the
favorite of the conservatives."
209,"MR. GREGORY:  The politics will dominate a lot of this year, but also,
Andrea, what the president's gone through this week with the aftermath,
the fallout from this Christmas Day terror plot.  David Broder wrote in
his column on Friday this about the president:  ""The Christmas plot
appears to have shaken Obama like nothing else that happened in his first
year.  When he allowed the White House to quote his warning to his
Cabinet colleagues that another `screw-up' like that could not be
tolerated, he seemed to signal that his benign leadership style had
reached its limits."" This is a priority now."
210,"MS. MITCHELL:  It's a priority, and it clearly was he, Barack Obama,
taking charge of this national security team, not just being a passive
recipient of briefings, but really saying, ""What are you doing?"" ""What
are you doing?"" ""Who's talking to whom?"" Let--you know, ""This is your
last warning.  You guys have got to change things.  You've got to start
communicating better."" It wasn't, obviously, that they didn't have the
information.  The analysis was not tough enough, it wasn't timely.
They've got to be much more rapid.  And with this new--with all the new
technologies, they've got the tools to do it. The people were just not up
to the job."
211,"MR. GREGORY:  And now a new warning out this weekend about a reminder of
the threats that come not just from Somalia and from Yemen, but also from
Pakistan and Afghanistan."
212,"MS. MITCHELL:  And this brings it home because al-Qaeda, we've been
saying, has become franchised, and they have gone from al-Qaeda central
to these other countries, Yemen and Somalia.  But here you've got the
martyr/suicide video of the man who did such incredible, grievous damage
to our CIA forces in Afghanistan in the bombing in Khost, and he is posed
next to the leader of the Taliban in Pakistan.  This is a retaliation
from them.  They're now going international.  They're going after this
target in Afghanistan in a way that they never have before.  It shows you
how they have stepped it up, and we have to get ahead of the game.  And
right now, we are on the defensive.  Now we have to look at everything in
our, in our arsenal, because if they penetrated so deeply, now we have to
look at ever other asset we have and wonder who out there is also a
turncoat."
213,"MR. GREGORY:  And how did the president come out of this week then,
Chuck?"
214,"MR. TODD:  Well, look, I think we shown where he's at this point in the
presidency where you do nothing almost but react to events on the ground.
You--he doesn't have the ability anymore, I think, to set an agenda in
the way that you--that first year presidents do.  We're truly in this
sort of second year in the rest of his presidency, reactive, really
quickly on this.  That Fort Hood review is going to be fascinating when
it comes out.  When that comes out in those congressional hearings,
that's when we may see some heads roll in the intelligence, investigative,
security community, whether it's domestic FBI or international with the
DI or the CIA."
215,MS. MITCHELL:  For missing the signals on Hasan and al Awlaki.
216,"MR. TODD:  Missing the--the missed, the missed signals on Hasan are very
similar to the missed signals on the Detroit bomber."
217,"MR. GREGORY:  Chuck, before you go, Harry Reid, the majority leader,
already facing a really tough re-election in 2010.  Now, as we referred
to early on in the program..."
218,MR. TODD:  Yes.
219,MR. GREGORY:  ...has some apologizing to do and is already doing it.
220,"MR. TODD:  He does.  And, you know, if he weren't Senator majority
leader, we would be talking about what kind of pressure is going on, what
kind of whisper campaign is going on behind the scenes to get Harry Reid
to do the right thing and retire.  The problem is he's the majority
leader.  That would send such a crazy signal to a party that is on the
brink of looking like it's in disarray politically right now, so they
couldn't afford to have it.  But, you know, Harry Reid's been a gaffe
machine in the past and he's gotten over it, but you do wonder, if he
somehow wins re-election, he would be doing something that an incumbent
senator, I don't think, has done in 50 years, which is recover from a
double-digit deficit.  It doesn't happen."
221,MR. GREGORY:  Does it hurt his relationship with the president?
222,"MR. TODD:  I don't--you know, not getting health care done would hurt his
relationship with the president.  I mean, you know, Harry Reid has said a
lot of dumb things behind the scenes to the president in the past, and
the president's a pretty forgiving guy."
223,"MR. GREGORY:  We're going to leave it there.  Thanks to both of you again
for coming out here with us."
224,"Want to mention, a special program note.  Be sure to watch the debut of
""The Daily Rundown,"" hosted by our White House team, Chuck Todd and also
Savannah Guthrie.  It starts Monday morning at 9 AM on MSNBC.  And their
exclusive guest on day one, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday:  Haiti in ruins.  After the earthquake, the death toll is staggering, perhaps tens of thousands.  So many still missing, buried under debris.  Their presidential palace leveled, the government crippled.  Officials estimate nearly three million people are still in need of aid.  With the sale of human suffering only now becoming clear, the president promises the Haitian people they will not be forsaken.
    "

2,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  As the international community continues to respond, I do believe that America has a continued responsibility to act."
3,(End videotape)
4,"MR. GREGORY:  What sort of long-term commitment in Haiti does the president envision?  What will it take in money and manpower to rebuild this island nation?  How was Haiti left so vulnerable to a disaster of this magnitude for so long?  We'll get the very latest on the situation from officials on the ground.  Then we sit down with former Presidents Bush and Clinton, who have joined together at the request of President Obama to lead fundraising and other relief efforts."
5,(Videotape)
6,"FMR. PRES. GEORGE W. BUSH:  Our job is to remind people that there's still an ongoing need, and we'll do that."
7,(End videotape)
8,"MR. GREGORY:  Then, as President Obama completes his first year in office, we take an in-depth look at what he's accomplished and how the American people view his presidency thus far.  Health care, the economy and politics as the president risks his own political capital to ensure Senator Ted Kennedy's seat in Massachusetts stays in the Democratic column.  Analysis this morning from two political insiders, former counselor to President George W. Bush Karen Hughes, and former White House chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, John Podesta; and two longtime Washington reporters, Time magazine's Mark Halperin, co-author of the new book ""Game Change,"" and The Washington Post's Bob Woodward."
9,"But first, good morning, we want to bring you up to date on all of the developments out of Haiti.  It has been five days since the devastating earthquake hit that island nation.  Latest estimates from the Haitian government, 50,000 bodies have already been recovered and the death toll is likely to be between 100,000 and 200,000.  Our preliminary Red Cross estimate puts the total number of affected people, affected Haitians, at 3.5 million. As the focus now moves from rescue operations to the massive task of trying to get food, water, and shelter to desperate survivors, all of this as there are increasing reports of looting and intensifying violence.  We will hear from former Presidents Bush and Clinton in just a moment on their joint fundraising efforts and how they are committed to a long-term rebuilding effort in this country of so much need."
10,"But first, let's get the very latest this morning on rescue and relief operations.  And for that we are joined in Port-au-Prince by Lieutenant General Ken Keen, a three-star general who is heading up the U.S.  military relief effort on the ground, and here in Washington by Dr. Rajiv Shah, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development."
11,Welcome to both of you.
12,"Dr. Shah, let me begin with you.  You were just in Haiti just yesterday with Secretary of State Clinton.  You had a chance to meet with officials of the government.  What is the latest?  What is your assessment on the ground there?"
13,"DR. RAJIV SHAH:  Well, I did have a chance to go to Haiti yesterday and it--it's just a reminder of what you articulated, that this has been a tremendous tragedy, that, that three and a half million people have been affected, perhaps even more.  There's been significant loss of life, and there's been significant degrading of the basic infrastructure--roads, the airport was inaccessible, the port has been destroyed.  And so it's a challenging, challenging situation.  But the president, immediately after this happened, pulled the Cabinet together and, and ordered a swift, aggressive and comprehensive and coordinated response, and that's what we've in--been in the process of doing.  Going to Haiti yesterday was a chance to visit with the brave Americans who are part of that response."
14,MR. GREGORY:  How big is this death toll going to be?  Do you have any sense of that?
15,"DR. SHAH:  Well, we have no reason to contradict the numbers that you were articulating and that we've all heard.  I think we'll get a lot more information as we are more active in collecting bodies and we'll--and as we're doing more of the recovery and rescue and, and, you know, getting through the buildings and through the debris.  There's, there's still a lot..."
16,MR. GREGORY:  You say rescue.  Is it still possible to find more people alive?
17,"DR. SHAH:  Absolutely.  This is still an active rescue operation.  We--as the U.S.  government, we were the first government to send rescue teams on the ground.  In fact, a team from Fairfax County, Virginia, that I had a chance to meet with, were the first ones to reach there.  They established a site of operations at the airport and helped coordinate and discharge the responsibilities of almost 30 other teams that came in from around the world. We have more than--almost 400 Americans actively involved in urban search and rescue.  These are teams with real capabilities, with, with specialized equipment, with lighting.  They work overnight, and they are really heroes.  I had a chance to meet with them yesterday.  They've saved dozens of people, mostly Haitians, and they're very committed, and they're actively involved in rescues."
18,"MR. GREGORY:  General Keen, let me turn to you down in Port-au-Prince.  Your priorities--food, water, safe shelter--how's it going?"
19,"LT. GEN. KEN KEEN:  Well, sir, we had a very good day yesterday getting out, delivering supplies.  We delivered over 130,000 rations and 70,000 bottles of water.  But that's just the beginning.  We're going to do better every day."
20,"MR. GREGORY:  The--some of the challenges you face right now, according to officials on the ground, is the potential for real chaos, for anarchy.  What is the role the government is playing right now and that the military's playing in trying to secure Haiti?"
21,"LT. GEN. KEEN:  Well, security is an inherent responsibility of providing humanitarian assistance.  We need a safe and secure environment to be successful.  But, fortunately, we have a United Nations mission here which has been doing this for several years.  But this is a, a disaster of epic proportions.  They are transitioned into humanitarian assistance operations as well, and security is a concern.  Yesterday our experience was that there is calm on the streets.  We had very good encounters with the Haitian population as we delivered humanitarian assistance.  But, as you noted, there are increasing incidents of security, and we are going to have to deal with it as we go forward."
22,MR. GREGORY:  How many U.S.  troops will be required to keep Haiti secure?
23,"LT. GEN. KEEN:  Well, I don't know how many it's going to take, but we're going to do it in conjunction with the United Nations.  Today I have over 1,000 troops on the ground in Haiti.  We're increasing that with a focus of getting our humanitarian supplies out to the people and doing so with security in mind and looking at this, as we go forward, to do just what you said, get a better understanding of what we need to get and address the entire population that's been affected by this disaster."
24,"MR. GREGORY:  There's been a lot of concern, as we hear a helicopter in the background there, about flights getting into Haiti and whether they were able to get in immediately to provide needed supplies.  There was frustration on that account between countries like the U.S.  and, and some of our partners in all of this.  The New York Times reported this about some concerns that the World Food Agency, the World Food Programme had.  ""`There are 200 flights,'"" The Times reported, ""`going in and out every day, which is an incredible amount for a country like Haiti,' said Jarry Emmanuel, the air logistics officer for the [World Food Program's] Haiti effort.  `But most of those flights are for the U.S.  military.  ...  Their priorities are to secure the country.  Ours are to feed.  We have got to get those priorities in sync.'"" Are those priorities in sync now?"
25,"LT. GEN. KEEN:  Well, I think the priorities are in sync, but it's a, a balance, it's a balance between getting the quantities of relief supplies that are so desperately needed, getting the logistical and people here that we need to get those supplies out to the area, as well as getting the forces here that you need for security.  And we've got to balance all of those, and we're working very closely with the United Nations and the government of Haiti to balance those priorities and get the things on the ground.  As you noted, the airport is our main logistical hub.  We're working aggressively to open up other ways to get in here.  The ports are part of that, but other surrounding airports such as in the Dominican Republic, hopefully we can see progress made to other avenues to get supplies in."
26,"MR. GREGORY:  Dr. Shah, the, the--one of the things you'll hear in my interview coming up with Presidents Bush and Clinton, President Bush saying, after Katrina, one of the things he learned is it takes time to get supplies in.  There's frustration about how long it's taken to get supplies into Haiti already.  What should we expect timewise?  And what are the repercussions of taking additional time when you've got a country that's so physically unstable?"
27,"DR. SHAH:  Well, look, we're aware that we're racing against the clock, and that is why, when the president asked us to have a swift and coordinated response, we didn't hesitate.  We immediately began at the U.S.  Agency for International Development and with partners from across the government--FEMA, DHS, and a number of others.  We immediately mobilized resources, food items, commodities like health and medical kits, and started sending those down to Haiti as soon as we possibly could.  As the general mentioned, the airport was, was inoperable originally because the control tower had been out.  and it, it was harder to get things in.  It was an important first step for the military to secure the airport, and we've entered into an arrangement with the Haitian government so that we're facilitating the operations of that airport, which has allowed for a significant expansion of capacity there and allowed for commodities and other personnel and other goods to come in."
28,"I also wanted to mention, as you mentioned the point about the World Food Programme, I've spoken with the executive director of the World Food Programme about this.  We are working in coordination with the U.S.  military and with international partners like WFP.  A lot of those planes that are, that are military C-130 aircraft are delivering supplies that are then going to NGO partners and other critical civilian partners for the people of Haiti.  One example is we recently sent, you know, three major water production and purification units because that's an immediate priority, making sure that people have access to water.  And those--each of those produces 100,000 liters of water a day.  We're, we're sending a fourth in, and we have six on the way from a warehouse in Dubai.  So, so even though they might enter in on military aircraft, those are often civilian commodities and commodities for the people of Haiti, and we're just using whatever is the best means and the most effective means to get it there quickly.  And that was a direct guidance from the president, that do whatever it takes to get supplies and services in as fast as you possibly can."
29,"MR. GREGORY:  General Keen, just under a minute left here.  I want to ask you, what role does the U.S.  government and military have to play here going forward, given the, the disorganized state of the government because of the state of Haiti?  Will the U.S.  have a role in running that country for some period of time?"
30,"LT. GEN. KEEN:  Well, we're not going to be running the country, we're going to be in support of the government of Haiti.  We're going to--alongside the United Nations, our first priority is getting water and food and other supplies out to the Haitian people, and doing that in a safe and secure environment.  It is a disaster of epic proportions and with a tremendous logistical challenge, as you noted."
31,"MR. GREGORY:  Final point, Dr. Shah, your priorities.  I know this is measured in hours, not just days.  What are your priorities now?"
32,"DR. SHAH:  Well, our priority up to now has been urban search and rescue. That will continue, because this is--continues to be an active rescue operation.  Our immediate priorities, especially for the next week, are significantly scaling up the flow of health and medicines--medical supplies, improving water access and distribution for the people of Haiti that have been affected, and making sure we get food into as many different neighborhoods and points of distribution as possible.  Every day we're doing more than the day before.  We need that continued exponential growth.  The good news is we're very focused on it.  We have tremendous support from the president, whom we're in contact with regularly, and, and all parts of the U.S.  government, including the military, which is a critical, needed asset to make sure we can reach affected populations, are working aggressively together to make this happen."
33,"MR. GREGORY:  General Keen, Dr. Shah, thank you both very much and continued good luck."
34,DR. SHAH:  Thank you.
35,"LT. GEN. KEEN:  Thank you, David."
36,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to turn to NBC's Kerry Sanders, who is also in Port-au-Prince this morning."
37,"And, Kerry, your, your reporting over the past several days has been so emotional and so first person.  You've been covering Haiti for so many years. Give me a sense of what you're seeing and what it's like there."
38,"MR. KERRY SANDERS:  Well, chaos is the one word.  But the good news is it appears that that chaos is beginning to perhaps have order, maybe, by the end of today.  That's because the U.S.  military has 600,000 humanitarian meals that they are actually getting to the people now, and the food and the water that they needed so desperately is there.  Once that's in place, some of the other things can start shaping up here."
39,"MR. GREGORY:  In my interview with Dr. Shah this morning, he, he said, a little bit unexpectedly, I think, that that window is still open to find survivors, which is something in the search and rescue operations that you've seen firsthand."
40,"SANDERS:  And an amazing story this morning.  We followed yesterday with a team from Turkey and from south Florida.  They are looking for folks inside a supermarket that collapsed.  And this morning Muriel Ditma, the 45-year-old woman who was here, her children in south Florida anxiously--not sleeping--got that most wonderful phone call that their mother had won the lottery.  She was found inside an air pocket in there.  After about 108 hours, they were able to pull her out alive along with two others, a 13-year-old girl, a little boy. So they're still looking for more folks there, as well as a team from the New York Fire Department.  Good news can still be had, they say."
41,"MR. GREGORY:  Kerry, finally, what--that level of frustration and desperation on the streets, give me a sense of what that, what that's like now.  There are some supplies that are reaching people, but it's taken some time."
42,"SANDERS:  It's taken some time and, you know, people are so anxious that when they see things they grab at them and, you know, the strongest win.  And so it's been a little difficult on that front.  And, of course, this is a, a huge, concentrated city and trying to get it to three million people is a real challenge.  And so, if you can get it into one street, you may help some people.  But this is a vast area that needs help and, quite frankly, difficult to get to in many cases."
43,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, Kerry Sanders, who's in Port-au-Prince at the airport.  You can hear all the activity behind him, which is actually the best sign, of flights coming in and supplies beginning to reach that island nation."
44,"Coming next, in an interview yesterday at the White House, Presidents Bush and Clinton talk about their commitment to the rebuilding effort in Haiti and what they are calling on Americans to do to help ease the human suffering there."
45,(Announcements)
46,MR. GREGORY:  A special conversation with former Presidents Bush and Clinton after this brief commercial break.
47,(Announcements)
48,"MR. GREGORY:  And we're back.  Yesterday in the Rose Garden, President Obama announced that former presidents Bush and Clinton had agreed to lead a major fundraising effort for relief and rebuilding in Haiti."
49,"(Videotape, January 16, 2010)"
50,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  By coming together in this way, these two leaders send an unmistakable message to the people of Haiti and to the people of the world. In these difficult hours, America stands united.  We stand united with the people of Haiti, who have shown such incredible resilience, and we will help them to recover and to rebuild."
51,(End videotape)
52,"MR. GREGORY:  After their meeting with President Obama, the two former presidents agreed to meet the press in a joint interview about Haiti and only Haiti."
53,"Let me start by asking you both, President Bush, what's your biggest concern right now?"
54,"FMR. PRES. BUSH:  My biggest concern is the, the Haitian people have security, water and food."
55,MR. GREGORY:  And those are big ifs right now.
56,"FMR. PRES. BUSH:  Well, they are.  But the president briefed us about military efforts to get food and water to the people and surging a lot of material.  And it's going to take a little bit of time to get it there, but I, I came away from the briefing confident it's going to happen."
57,"MR. GREGORY:  President Clinton, the basics are so important."
58,"FMR. PRES. BILL CLINTON:  Right.  This is about water, food, medical supplies and care, and, and shelter, secure shelter.  We--I have some protection concerns, but we were just told in the briefing that 40 percent of the Haitian police force has signed back in, volunteered for duty.  A lot of them don't have uniforms or weapons or anything anymore, but the American military is working closely with the U.N.  troops that are there, and they'll get this organized.  They're doing a good job.  We just need more help.  We literally don't have enough food to feed them now.  We don't have--and, and there are two issues.  One is buying it, and the second is getting it in and distributing it.  But that's what everybody's working on."
59,"MR. GREGORY:  Beyond the initial rush, does there have to be some kind of U.N.-U.S.  temporary government?  Do we have to have a role in running the government for a time?"
60,"FMR. PRES. CLINTON:  Well, I don't think we have to have a role in running the government.  But we have, have to have a role in helping them to do things that require an organization that no longer exists.  For example, Hillary yesterday morning negotiated an agreement with the Haitian government for our military to operate the airport at Port-au-Prince for three days, subject to renegotiation.  They didn't have the people to do it anymore.  And so now they can keep it open 24 hours a day.  They can make good judgments about who should land when, according to priorities.  They'll have things to do for some time.  I understand that President Preval has asked former Prime Minister Pierre-Louis to coordinate the reconstruction.  If so, that's good news.  She and the current prime minister are both very able people, and they'll tell us what they need.  And I think the rest of us will just do it."
61,"MR. GREGORY:  President Bush, the--President Obama promised a long-term American commitment.  What does that mean?"
62,"FMR. PRES. BUSH:  Well, that means that after the, the devastating scenes get off television, there are people around to remind the American people it's important to help this country rebuild, really what it means.  I mean, both of us have been through crises.  There's this initial stage of, you know, trauma and major media focus.  But you'll end up focusing somewhere else here, after a while, and, and that's normal.  And our job is to remind people that there's still an ongoing need.  And we'll, we'll do that.  That's part of the purpose of our, our fund is to say to the American people, ""Rebuilding is a long-term project."""
63,FMR. PRES. CLINTON:  Yes.
64,"MR. GREGORY:  As special envoy, you've talked about having a big role in that long-term development to restore Haiti to what it was.  What's it going to take, and how long is it going to take to restore it back to what it was?  And what kind of Haiti is that?"
65,"FMR. PRES. CLINTON:  Well, first of all, we're not--before this earthquake we weren't talking about restoring it.  We were talking about building a whole new country, and there was a government plan that they developed in cooperation with the U.N., but it was their plan.  And what I believe will happen is they will take all this devastation into account, all the work that has to be done, and they'll rewrite their plan, and they'll put it as part of building a new country.  So I think that what we want to do is to see people be part of building something, to use President Bush's terms, building something stronger; that, that it's not just enough to rebuild.  And, and they're committed to that.  And I think that the, based on my meetings with donors, with private sector, with investors, everybody that was helping them before feels even more strongly they ought to continue to do it now."
66,"MR. GREGORY:  President Bush, what about skeptics?  This is a country that has such a history of political dysfunction, societal dysfunction."
67,FMR. PRES. BUSH:  Yeah.
68,"MR. GREGORY:  Look at its neighbor, the Dominican Republican, so much better off.  Should that be a factor in part of the conversation about how much is given, that resistance to change, the fact that aid on a massive scale has not proven to lift countries like Haiti out of poverty?"
69,"FMR. PRES. BUSH:  Well, I, I, I think this.  First of all, the initial thrust of aid is going to save lives, and that's really important.  Secondly, as President Clinton mentioned, there is a strategy in place to help Haiti build in a different direction, and, in other words, learn lessons from the past and focus on what'll work in the future.  And I, I, I think it's going to be very important for our country never to give up on Haiti.  Obviously it's OK to ask whether or not the plan is going to make sense, but we shouldn't abandon our neighbor down there.  It's--there's just too much human suffering that can take--has taken place and can continue to take place if we neglect Haiti."
70,"MR. GREGORY:  President Clinton, look at our experience, almost a trillion dollars in trying to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan, the money that's been poured into Haiti.  Why does Haiti matter strategically?"
71,"FMR. PRES. CLINTON:  Because, number one, it has the highest AIDS rate in the Caribbean, and our neighbors, we don't want them spending money on crushing health burdens that they can avoid.  Number two, it's the poorest country in the Caribbean, and it's holding the whole region back.  And the Caribbean and Central America and Latin America, they all want to help now. For the first time in my lifetime, they are committed to being good partners with Haiti.  And number three, they actually have shown a willingness to change, to, to, to improve their own circumstances.  And, therefore, if they could succeed where they have failed for 200 years, that would change our idea of what is possible, not just here, but in Africa and East Asia and everywhere else.  They're not in--this government has not made excuses.  They've said, ""We know we've made mistakes in the past.  We want to changes."" I have seen them make several changes just since I've been working.  That's worth it all over the world."
72,"MR. GREGORY:  President Bush, what did you learn in your government's response to the tsunami, to the disaster response to Katrina?  What lessons did you learn that this administration should bear in mind?"
73,"FMR. PRES. BUSH:  First of all, it takes time to get the supplies in place, but that, that shouldn't deter them.  In other words, there, there's an expectation amongst people that things are going to happen quickly, and, and sometimes it's hard to make things happen quickly.  Secondly, there is a great reservoir of good will that wants to help.  And that's why he asked us to help, and we're glad to do it.  I need to put a pitch in for the clintonbushhaitifund.org.  One of my concerns around any crisis is that shysters show up and take advantage of people's good will and generosity.  And so, therefore, if people want to help, one, one avenue besides the established NGOs would be to, would be to tap onto that Web site, and, and we'll, we'll help make sure your money is spent in a transparent, accountable way."
74,"MR. GREGORY:  In some circles, the president's been criticized for politicizing this disaster.  Do you think that's fair?"
75,"FMR. PRES. BUSH:  I, I, I don't know what, what they're talking about.  I, I, I've been briefed by the president about the response.  And as I said in my opening comment, I, I appreciate the president's quick response to this disaster."
76,"MR. GREGORY:  President Clinton, why does it take a disaster of this scale and magnitude away from the United States to create this kind of bipartisanship?"
77,"FMR. PRES. CLINTON:  Well, I think that when something like this happens inside the United States we act in the same way.  I, I think that it reminds us of our common humanity.  It reminds us of needs that go beyond fleeting disagreements.  Whatever our policy disputes are don't seem to matter much when people are dying and hungry and sick.  And I think it's just a natural human response.  Just as people's disagreements are natural human response and, in normal times, can be healthy.  It, it wouldn't be healthy for America if, if, in normal times, we had no political debates.  And it would be perverse if, in a time like this, we let lesser matters keep us from joining hands."
78,"MR. GREGORY:  President Bush, you're back."
79,"FMR. PRES. BUSH:  Indeed.  It's a little nostalgic, and I'm glad I've come back for this purpose.  I must confess I, I really--I miss you as a person, but I don't miss the spotlight."
80,MR. GREGORY:  I think I'll take that as a compliment.
81,FMR. PRES. BUSH:  Yes.
82,MR. GREGORY:  Good luck to you both.  Thank you.
83,FMR. PRES. BUSH:  Thank you.
84,FMR. PRES. CLINTON:  Thank you so much.
85,"MR. GREGORY:  And up next, we'll talk politics and assess the first full year of the Obama presidency.  Our political roundtable joins us:  insiders Karen Hughes and John Podesta, and reporters mark Halperin and Bob Woodward, after this brief station break."
86,(Announcements)
87,"MR. GREGORY:  We are back and joined by former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, John Podesta; and former counselor, senior adviser to President George W. Bush, Ambassador Karen Hughes; Bob Woodward, of course, of The Washington Post; and Mark Halperin of Time magazine, he's also the author of ""Game Change."""
88,"Welcome to all of you.  So much to get to this morning.  Let's talk about the horrible circumstances in Haiti.  On the cover of Newsweek this morning, the president himself writing the cover story ""Why Haiti Matters."""
89,"Karen Hughes, you've, you've seen disaster response up close as part of the Bush administration.  Is it too early to make any evaluation of how well it's going so far, how well the government is mobilizing?"
90,"MS. KAREN HUGHES:  Well, I think the--all the American people want our government to do exactly what our government is doing, and that is try to get help to those people as quickly as we possibly can.  I have been through disasters.  We had the tsunami in Indonesia.  We had the earthquake in Pakistan.  I traveled there shortly thereafter.  And all the American people--I think it's a wonderful picture for the world to see two former presidents from different political parties coming together to deliver the compassion of the American people to people in, in desperate need."
91,"MR. GREGORY:  And President Bush has wanted to stay away from Washington and kind of out of the spotlight, but he felt the need to get involved here."
92,"MS. HUGHES:  Well, I think this is a great way for him to come back into the spotlight, as, as you say.  I--he was joking with you about not, not missing it too much, and I don't think he's missing the, the, you know, the, being in the news every day.  But this is a, a big calling for him and a humanitarian cause that I think everyone's heart has been touched by this, and he's glad to do what he can to, to help raise funds for, for this desperate situation."
93,"MR. GREGORY:  John Podesta, again, you've also seen this kind of disaster release--relief up close, having worked in the White House.  How much of our response, our government's response, is still heavily influenced by mistakes made in the response to Hurricane Katrina?"
94,"MR. JOHN PODESTA:  Well, I think the, the White House got right on this, and, and you saw not just people like Raj Shah, who you had on, Secretary Clinton, but the president himself, the, the very night of the earthquake in the Situation Room directing USAID and the rest of the resources, including our military assets, down towards that.  And I think, certainly, they realize that they had to respond with alacrity, and I think they've done that.  But I, I agree with Karen that I think that this effort, the president asking former President Clinton, former President Bush to come together and do this shows the best of America.  The president, in his Newsweek comment, said, ""This is who we are, this is what we do,"" and I agree with that.  And so I think we all need to support that."
95,"MR. GREGORY:  America, of course, has a close relationship with Haiti, has been so involved over time.  We put together a little bit of that context and background which you can look at."
96,"1934, that's when the U.S.  ends a nearly two-decade occupation of Haiti. More recently, September 1994, 20,000 U.S.  troops are sent by President Bill Clinton to help reinstall President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who had been ousted in a violent 1991 coup.  February 2004, a controversial end to Aristide's presidency during another violent rebellion.  U.S.  Marines land in Haiti to help restore order.  Then late summer 2008, four catastrophic tropical storms and hurricanes hit Haiti; hundreds killed, nearly a million homeless or in need of aid.  And the U.S.  government commits over $30 million in additional humanitarian assistance."
97,"So, Bob Woodward, the cruel irony of this is that you heard President Clinton say Haiti was just about to turn that corner.  The question now, given how far back it's been set, what's the political will in this country to maintain the kind of commitment to Haiti that Presidents Bush and Clinton are talking about?"
98,"MR. BOB WOODWARD:  Well, I actually think it's genuine.  And what's interesting politically and morally is you have two former presidents sitting there and saying, ""We agree.  We're going to do this."" You have the kind of slasher mentality, the partisan mentality that people who are their backers on both the left and the right tend to engage in this kind of, ""Let's kill the other guy, let's get out the chainsaw and rip him up."" And then you see the leaders there saying, ""Now wait a minute, there is a consensus."" And I, I think when there's a consensus, a political consensus in this country, people act on it.  But this is a monumental disaster.  And if you talk to people on the ground--and, I mean, the logistics of getting--I mean, the general was saying 70,000 bottles of water.  You know, how much is that compared to what is needed?  I think it's millions of bottles of water, if not tens of millions of bottles of water."
99,"MR. GREGORY:  Mark Halperin, we, we see this when we cover presidents.  There is an interruption to the presidency of events like this that somehow become a priority that, that an administration never can anticipate."
100,"MR. MARK HALPERIN:  Well, David, just don't forget, just a few weeks ago there was another such interruption when there was the attempted--attempt to blow up a plane flying into the United States.  That was seen as just this, a chance to take the, the temperature of the United States to say, ""Can we come together at a time of crisis in a bipartisan way to try to deal with a big problem?"" We're now getting a second one of those.  And from you--as you said, we're seeing a president who had plans for this month that didn't involve dealing with this crisis.  I think they're dealing with it extraordinarily well from a mechanical point of view, from a public relations point of view. But it's going to involve two things going forward, I think.  One is continued execution for what Bob suggested, which is getting more stuff there.  And I think it's also an opportunity for the president to try to keep the country together.  The two former presidents, Clinton and Bush, come together, but we see Rush Limbaugh say something outrageous and not a lot of repudiation from Republicans in Congress or others to say, ""This is unacceptable.  It's a time when the American people are showing our best to help, not a time for that kind of--to try to take partisan...(unintelligible)."""
101,"MR. GREGORY:  But you heard President Bush dismiss that out of hand as doesn't know what critics would be talking about and, and really focused on going out of his way to compliment the president on, on the response so far."
102,"MR. HALPERIN:  The former presidents, no question..."
103,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
104,"MR. HALPERIN:  ...showing extraordinary bipartisan leadership.  I'm talking about other Republicans in this country who shouldn't be silent at, at such an outrageous remark at a time when we should be coming together."
105,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk about where this president stands one year in, where there's now so much on the, on the table.  Look at some of these poll numbers that a moment in time capture where he is.  From CNN/Opinion Research, ""Do you consider the first year of the Obama administration to be a success or failure?"" Forty-eight percent say a failure.  And then this question from the Allstate/National Journal/Heartland Monitor poll which asked, ""If the 2012 election were held today, who would you vote for?"" Fifty percent say somebody else."
106,"John Podesta, there's a reason why they're four-year terms.  The election is not today, as the White House likes to point out."
107,MR. PODESTA:  Right.
108,MR. GREGORY:  How did the president get to this point?
109,"MR. PODESTA:  Well, look, he inherited the worst financial crisis since FDR, he--two wars.  We were shedding 700,000 jobs a--in the month that he came into office.  He's had to move in, step in and build, I think, the platform for long-term success with the recovery bill that's even, even Republicans admit either saved or created one and a half million jobs.  He's got to go further on that, I think.  He's ended up restoring America's standing in the world.  I think that he's also a hair's breadth away from actually making health care affordable and--for every American.  And I think once that happens, and I think that, that the American people are educated, again, about what's in that bill and what's in it for them, I think that he's, he's laid the foundation for long-term political success.  And, and I think that, that, he'll, he'll achieve that, so those numbers will change."
110,MS. HUGHES:  Well...
111,"MR. GREGORY:  Karen, you see it differently?"
112,"MS. HUGHES:  ...with all, with all due respect, you'll notice he went immediately to the blame game.  And I hope with the end of this, with this first year in office that we can stop blaming everything.  It's a human tendency to blame your predecessor, but it's not very presidential.  And..."
113,"MR. PODESTA:  I did, I didn't even blame the, the--his predecessor.  I just..."
114,"MS. HUGHES:  You started with ""he inherited."""
115,"MR. PODESTA:  No, I said what the..."
116,MS. HUGHES:  Every president...
117,MR. PODESTA:  ...what the facts on the ground were when he came into office.
118,"MS. HUGHES:  Yeah.  Every president inherits challenges.  President Bush inherited a recession when, when he took office.  I think the, the, the first year has been very disappointing, and the reason is that, that President Obama has not governed as he campaigned.  The lofty rhetoric of the campaign has run into the hard realities of governing and, as a result, that euphoria, that Obama bubble has burst.  And I believe the punctures were self-inflicted.  He tried to do too much.  I saw this morning in the newspaper--and don't take it from a Republican--there was a Democratic senator who said that the American people, when they voted for change, did not think they were voting for higher taxes, higher deficits, and much more government intrusion in their lives. And that was Democratic Senator Evan Bayh."
119,MR. GREGORY:  Bob?
120,"MR. WOODWARD:  I did some research.  Remember Ronald Reagan?  If you look at Reagan now, liberals, Democrats, academics say he had a very successful presidency.  Pretty universally agreed.  Whether that's right or not, we'll, we'll see what the next bounce of history is.  But Lou Cannon, who is the White House correspondent for The Washington Post, wrote the--he's the premiere biographer of Reagan, and after Reagan left two terms, he wrote his monumental work on this.  But after a year in the Reagan presidency, Lou also wrote a book which I'm sure he doesn't want remembered, and it was just called ""Reagan."" And I got it out, and this is what Lou Cannon said right at this time in the Reagan presidency in 1982, ""Reagan was, for all his optimism, running out of time.  His reach had exceeded his grasp.  Age and events had dimmed a sense of leadership."" Now get this, ""By 1982 it was an axiom in the White House that Reagan, like so many of his modern predecessors, would be a one-term president.  I believe that Reagan will not run again."""
121,MS. HUGHES:  But they did lose seats in 1982 in Congress.
122,"MR. WOODWARD:  Now, now, now what's important about this, we don't know with Obama, but it's also possible for--you know, Lou Cannon was the best.  Always kept his, kept his head about Reagan's positive traits, negative traits.  He had it wrong.  So, you know, all of these pronouncements about disappointment and so forth I think are crap."
123,"MR. GREGORY:  There have, there have--not to put too fine a point on it."
124,"But, Mark Halperin, you know, the president himself said recently the American people are right to be deflated about where we are at this point, which is not an admission that he doesn't, you know, that he thinks he's doing a bad job, but the governing is difficult and that the problems are difficult."
125,"MR. HALPERIN:  Well, look, go back to the campaign.  The country took a risk on Barack Obama, he was untested.  And if you look at what Hillary Clinton and John McCain both said about him, they said, ""He's just words.  He doesn't know how to run the government."" I think, ironically, it's just the opposite.  He's done, I think, an extraordinary job running the government, as John said, under difficult circumstances.  He managed the economic crisis and kept the world from going into a depression.  He staffed the government with very quality, quality people.  He showed he could be commander-in-chief and manage these two difficult wars.  What I think, ironically, the problem has been is he's not inspired the country to feel a sense of optimism and renewal and to be unified in a bipartisan way.  Those are the things I think people thought he would excel at.  Those are, I think, are the problems.  He's making progress in governance, not necessarily in that bully pulpit leadership."
126,"MS. HUGHES:  I think he really misread the country.  I mean, 2009 was a year of the greatest anxiety I've ever seen among the American people.  People were worried.  They felt they were at the whim of these big forces beyond their control--you know, Wall Street and banks failing and businesses that were too big to fail.  And rather than calm that anxiety, I worry that President Obama in being overly ambitious and pushing this massive health care that people worry we can't pay for and, and will have unintended consequences, he actually exacerbated that anxiety.  And so I think he fundamentally misread the country.  And I, I have to disagree with you, Mark, about rescuing the economy, I think that happened before President Bush left office when they took the action that they did on TARP, and the banks have now repaid much of that money, but that's what stabilized the economy and prevented the collapse of the financial system."
127,"MR. GREGORY:  But he ran on health care, and President Bush went for Social Security in that year one of that second term, because presidents know you've got a window to work with."
128,"MS. HUGHES:  I just think he did too--he tried to do too much at a time when the American people were fundamentally most concerned about the, the economy and the jobs."
129,"MR. PODESTA:  Yeah, look, I think President Obama had a theory of the case, and that was that in order to create long-term sustainable growth that was going to get wages growing again so that the growth was fairly shared for--with the American people.  He had to reform health care, he had to change the way we use and produce energy and, and move to a clean energy future, he had to reform public education.  And I think that was his theory of the case. He, he injected himself into all those things.  The House has actually passed, including financial regulatory reform, all those matters.  The question is was that theory right?  I believe it was.  And when will it take effect?"
130,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, it's interesting you, you..."
131,"MR. PODESTA:  And that, that is going to be measured by when do we get jobs grown again?"
132,"MR. GREGORY:  Jobs.  But also, if there's a theory of the case, it's also a populous pitch that we're hearing from this president.  Here's the cover of The Economist magazine as it talks about what the president has to do in a new year, ""Time to get tough."" And this was the weekly radio address when the president talked about the banks in this country and a tax that he wants to levy against the banks to--as part of the TARP process and reclaiming some of that money.  This is what he said yesterday:"
133,"(Videotape, January 16, 2010)"
134,"PRES. OBAMA:  Of course, I would like the banks to embrace the sense of mutual responsibility.  So far, though, they have ferociously fought financial reform.  The industry's even joined forces with the opposition party to launch a massive lobbying campaign against commonsense rules to protect consumers and prevent another crisis.  Now, like clockwork, the banks and the politicians who curry their favor are already trying to stop this fee from going into effect.  The very same firms reaping billions of dollars in profits and reportedly handing out more money in bonuses and compensation than ever before in history are now pleading poverty.  It's a sight to see."
135,(End videotape)
136,"MR. GREGORY:  Bob Woodward, I mean, this is clear, he wants a fight with the banks, they want a fight on financial reform as part of this election year."
137,"MR. WOODWARD:  Well, not only that, but you, you talk of the theory of the case.  I think one of the things, either rightly or wrongly, President Obama has done is said, ""Look, we've got these massive problems.  We're not going to solve them in a year or two years."" And it--in, in, in the world of politics and management it's called strategic thinking.  Go down the line, two or three or even five years, what do you want to do?  And there are no fixes here.  He realizes that and has set up a program.  Now I, you know, I think Karen's right in part that President Bush actually laid the groundwork for saving the economy, but Obama certainly has followed on that.  And lots of the things that seem to be success, namely saving the banks, which Bush and Obama did. And, and, and if you really talk to the economists, it saved the American economy.  Now the success looks like a failure because they're paying all those bonuses."
138,"MR. GREGORY:  You, you raised President Bush.  Karen, I've been meaning to ask you this, in terms of taking the longer view, one thing that hasn't happened is that former Vice President Cheney has taken a shorter time horizon, has been very critical of this president on national security.  How does President Bush, who has remained quiet, feel about his former vice president being so critical of this president?"
139,"MS. HUGHES:  Well, I think, you know, you have to look at the fact that, that Vice President Cheney has served this country as a congressman, as a secretary of defense, as a chief of staff to the president, as the vice president.  Far be it from me to suggest that he doesn't have the full right to exercise his free speech and, and speak out as he can.  President Bush has taken a different approach, has said he thought that he owes his, his--the--President Obama his silence, and so I, I think that he will continue to maintain that. I do think that President..."
140,MR. GREGORY:  But is he critical of his former vice president?  Does he disagree with that speaking out?
141,"MS. HUGHES:  Well, again, I, I, I don't think it's appropriate for me to put words in, in President Bush's mouth.  His interview with you was about Haiti, and I think that's what he chose to talk about.  I do feel that, that..."
142,MR. WOODWARD:  This is a way of saying read President Bush's book when it comes out.
143,"MS. HUGHES:  Well, I just don't think it's appropriate for me, for me to share that.  But I, I do think that, that President Obama has, has made some decisions that have been very ill-advised in the area of national security. For example, the, the decision to try the, the, the Christmas Day--the al-Qaeda operative who came here to engage in an act of war against our country on, on Christmas Day in civilian courts is a mistake.  He's someone who was training in the training camps in Yemen.  He might have knowledge of other pending attacks against our country.  He should have been interrogated, legally, and, and designated as an enemy combatant and interrogated."
144,MR. GREGORY:  He did provide a good deal of information just being interrogated by existing methods.
145,"MS. HUGHES:  Well, he could have used that.  And..."
146,"MR. GREGORY:  No, he, he, he was, he provided a lot of information so far."
147,"MS. HUGHES:  I hope so.  But I--again, I think it's a mistake to take someone--we have to be very honest about what, what is at stake in..."
148,MR. PODESTA:  That is exactly...
149,MS. HUGHES:  ...in this war against al-Qaeda.
150,"MR. PODESTA:  That's exactly what the Bush administration did with Mr. Reid, the shoe bomber, who was in very similar circumstances, was traveling to the United States."
151,MS. HUGHES:  Circumstances weren't similar.  He was not sent here by al-Qaeda to engage in an act of war against our country.  It was not a similar situation.
152,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me, let me get--bring--turn the, the, the subject to the politics of health care and, and fighting with the banks and the politics of Massachusetts, Mark Halperin.  Today President Obama is on his way to campaign for Martha Coakley.  She's running hard, trying to fill that seat that was held by Senator Kennedy, and she faces a very tough fight in Scott Brown, who is the state senator who, in some ways, seemed to come out of nowhere, as a--been an effective campaigner and debater.  And now this, this is a tough race.  The White House, in fact, is bracing for a loss here by Coakley.  They are talking about different routes to get health care passed even if she loses.  What's going to happen?"
153,"MR. HALPERIN:  The press is famous for over interpreting the results of special elections historically.  This one can not be overstated.  The political and substantive implications of this race are enormous, not in the short--only in the short term, but in the long term.  You are right, David, the White House believes this race is probably slipping away from them.  They hold out some hope, that's why the president's going.  There is a silver lining for them if they lose this race, which is, at that point, the only way I see they can pass health care is to go to the House of Representatives and say, ""You must pass the Senate bill.  We'll work with you in order to try to find a way to make it better with other legislation."" But the benefits of that are twofold.  One, they prefer the Senate bill.  To extent the bill was going to move to the left in negotiations between the House and Senate, the White House didn't like it.  And they only have to have one vote then.  They don't have to re-vote in the Senate.  Joe Lieberman, Ben Nelson don't hold vetoes over a final bill."
154,"MR. GREGORY:  What about the impact of the president?  Does he have--what, what does he do coming in at the last minute?"
155,"MR. WOODWARD:  Well, I mean, it may help.  It may hurt.  But, you know, what's interesting from, who is Barack Obama as president?  And, and, and there are people who tried--there was a column The Washington Post Friday in which Charles Krauthammer tried to essentially say he is a European-style socialist because of health care and he's trying to do these other things. Now, I'm trying to do a book on President Obama, and calling him a European socialist is just not even in the ballpark.  It's like taking and calling President Bush, because he arranged and worked with Teddy Kennedy on No Child Left Behind, or a prescription drug plan for the elderly, calling George Bush a European socialist, which would be absurd."
156,"MS. HUGHES:  Well, I'm not in the name-calling game..."
157,MR. WOODWARD:  Barack Obama is not that.
158,"MS. HUGHES:  ...but, Bob, would you, would you admit that he has governed far to the left of the way he campaigned?  He campaigned as a centrist and has not governed that way."
159,"MR. WOODWARD:  Listen, I tell you, look at so many of these things that he's done with the economy, so many of these things in national security.  He sent--ordered 51,000 troops to Afghanistan.  I mean, I mean that's something..."
160,"MS. HUGHES:  And I, and I think that was right, and I applaud him for that. I, I applaud him for that decision."
161,"MR. WOODWARD:  OK, but that is a defining decision.  Anyway, but we'll see whether it works out and how it turns out."
162,"MR. GREGORY:  John, John Podesta, what are the reverberations of Massachusetts?"
163,"MR. PODESTA:  I think they'd be big if, if she loses.  I think actually that, that Martha Coakley will probably scratch it out at the end of the day.  I, I take what Mark has, has to say, but I think she'll probably scratch it out because they've--they're are throwing everything at it.  But it'll, it'll be big.  I, I agree with Mark about one thing.  I think that there are paths forward and that the, the Congress will find a way to pass healthcare reform because they know they absolutely have to do that having gotten this far.  And there, there are a variety of different paths."
164,"I think that the one thing I disagreed with about--that he said was I don't think the, the White House would be happy with just the Senate bill passing. I think they want to see some changes and they have to find a way through reconciliation or..."
165,"MR. GREGORY:  If, but..."
166,MR. PODESTA:  ...other processes to get that through Congress.
167,"MR. GREGORY:  If it passes, Karen, how do Republicans campaign on health care?  Do they campaign against it, and will they be successful doing so?"
168,"MS. HUGHES:  Well, I think, I think if it passes, that's almost the worst case scenario for the Democrats because it's going to cost a lot more than we've been told and it's going to have a lot of unintended consequences.  So it's--it would be bad for the Democrats if a bill didn't pass.  It would be worse for the Democrats if this bill passes."
169,"MR. PODESTA:  Yes.  Yeah, it's, you know..."
170,MS. HUGHES:  And I think it's a victory for Republicans that we're sitting here talking about the Massachusetts Senate race.
171,MR. GREGORY:  They do have....
172,"MR. PODESTA:  We're talking about Massachusetts.  Massachusetts passed universal health care under a Republican governor and Democratic legislature. At the time, a majority of the people, having watched the sausage making, were against the, the bill by the time it finally passed.  Today 80 percent don't want to see it repealed.  So things change."
173,MS. HUGHES:  And it's been more expensive and less effective than promised.
174,"MR. PODESTA:  Things, things, things change once they're in effect.  And I--if the, if the Republicans campaign on repealing a bill that extends coverage to 31 million people, creates an affordable platform for going forward..."
175,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
176,MR. PODESTA:  ...I think it would be a big mistake.
177,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  The debate's going to continue.  We're going to leave it there.  Thank you all very much.
178,"We're going to continue our discussion, by the way, with author Mark Halperin about his new book on the 2008 campaign.  It's called ""Game Change."" It's our MEET THE PRESS Take Two web extra.  It will be up on our Web site this afternoon."
179,"Also on our Web site, you can find links to the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, as well as many other charitable organizations that are mobilizing to help the people of Haiti.  That's all at mtp.msnbc.com."

        MR.  DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, the stunning upset in Massachusetts is the shot heard round the political world.
    "
1,(Videotape)
2,SEN.-ELECT SCOTT BROWN:  Tonight the independent majority has delivered a great victory.

4,(Videotape)
5,"PRES.  BARACK OBAMA:  Got to admit, we had a little bit of a buzz saw this week."
6,(End videotape)
7,MR.  GREGORY:  Is healthcare reform dead amid growing concerns about what Washington is doing to create jobs?
8,(Videotape)
9,"PRES.  OBAMA:  So long as I have the privilege of serving as your president, I will not stop fighting for you.  I will take my lumps, but I won't stop fighting to bring back jobs here."
10,(End videotape)
11,"MR.  GREGORY:  What does the president do now?  How will he frame his agenda during next week's State of the Union address?  Our exclusive guest morning, senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett."
12,"Then the Republicans.  The Massachusetts victory gives the minority party a shot in the arm, but does the GOP stand for something more than opposition to the Obama agenda?  We'll ask Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky."
13,"Plus, our roundtable assesses the political landscape and the Obama agenda. With us, The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne, BBC World News America's Katty Kay, The Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan and NBC News chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd."
14,"Finally, in our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE, January 1976, another time of economic turmoil.  Democratic presidential candidate Senator Lloyd Bentsen offers some practical advice to then President Gerald Ford on his upcoming State of the Union address."
15,"(Videotape, January 18, 1976)"
16,SEN.  LLOYD BENTSEN (D-TX):  We should be creating opportunity.  What people are really looking for in this country is a return of self-confidence.
17,(End videotape)
18,"MR.  GREGORY:  But first, senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett."
19,Welcome back to the program.  Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
20,"MS.  VALERIE JARRETT:  Well, thank you, David.  It's a pleasure to be here."
21,MR.  GREGORY:  Thank you.  There is some news developing overnight that I wanted to ask you about.
22,MS.  JARRETT:  Sure.
23,"MR.  GREGORY:  Osama bin Laden has reportedly cut another audiotape claiming responsibility for the Christmas Day attempted bombing.  Is that his voice, and is it striking that he appears to be back in charge of calling the shots on running operations for al-Qaeda?"
24,"MS.  JARRETT:  We have no independent confirmation that that is, in fact, his voice.  But let's look at--the fact of the matter is, is that he's a murderer, he has attacked Americans.  In fact, he's killed more Muslims than any other group in the region.  And so the president is committed to going after al-Qaeda and all of their affiliates and bringing them to justice."
25,MR.  GREGORY:  Is he in direct command and control of al-Qaeda?  Is that the view of the intelligence community?
26,"MS.  JARRETT:  We have, we have, we have no independent verification of that whatsoever, but we are going to go after al-Qaeda and its affiliates and certainly him for the atrocities of the past."
27,MR.  GREGORY:  The other big news story this morning is the question about whether Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is going to be confirmed for another term. Where is the level of confidence right now within the White House that he will get the requisite votes?
28,"MS.  JARRETT:  Oh, it's very high.  President Obama checked in with the leadership over the weekend, and he heard from Senator Reid that there is a lot of support for Ben Bernanke.  We are confident that the chairman will be confirmed."
29,"MR.  GREGORY:  So much news this week out of Massachusetts.  The stunning victory of Scott Brown, the Republican, in that special election.  And the obvious question that came out of that is what's next for healthcare reform? The president was out in Ohio on Friday, he was talking about health care, talking about jobs, but he said he's going to keep fighting for health care. So what specifically will he fight for?"
30,"MS.  JARRETT:  He's going to fight for what he's always been fighting for, David.  Look, the fact of the matter is, you're right, it was a stunning victory.  But the people in Massachusetts already have healthcare reform.  In fact, Senator Brown voted for the healthcare reform that Massachusetts has. He said he wouldn't vote to repeal it.  And in fact, we're very confident that it's similar to the bills that are currently being debated here."
31,MR.  GREGORY:  So he'll fight for everything?
32,"MS.  JARRETT:  He's going to--of course, he's going to fight for the American people.  David, listen, nothing changed about the fact that costs are escalating too high, that out-of-pocket expenses for health care are growing, that premiums have doubled over the last 10 years, that people who do not have insurance need insurance, the people who do have insurance are losing it because of pre-existing conditions, that the deficit is looming out of control in large part because of health care and that small businesses are having to choose between laying off people and paying for health care."
33,MR.  GREGORY:  I understand the arguments for health care.
34,MS.  JARRETT:  That--none of that changed as a result of that election.
35,MR.  GREGORY:  But what specifically in the bill will he continue to fight for?  Does everything have to be in there in order for it to be considered reform by this president?
36,"MS.  JARRETT:  What he's doing and what happened over the course of the weekend is there've been a series of phone calls and conversations to try to see what, what the climate is, what's the art of the possible.  But what the president is always going to do is try to push hard for the American people. He's not going to give up on that because of one election in Massachusetts. He's going to continue to work hard.  We don't know what's going to happen. But what we do know is that we have a president committed to delivering for the American people."
37,MR.  GREGORY:  So he'll fight for the package as-is?
38,"MS.  JARRETT:  He's going to fight for trying to get as absolutely as much as he can to reduce the cost of health care, to provide insurance, provide a security and safety for those folks who have insurance now, all of the core principles that we set forth at the very beginning of the process; core principles, I might add, that were included in both the bill that was passed by the Senate and the bill that was passed by the House."
39,"MR.  GREGORY:  The, the..."
40,"MS.  JARRETT:  So we'll see where we go, David."
41,"MR.  GREGORY:  Republicans have said he has not been bipartisan in this process.  Is he now prepared to sit down with Republican leaders to figure out what, precisely, could be passed?"
42,"MS.  JARRETT:  David, he has been prepared since day one--in fact, he has sat down with the leadership the members of--on the Republican Party, both the House and the Senate.  And in fact, bills in both the House and the Senate contain provisions that were suggested by the Republican Party.  So nothing's changed about the president's approach.  I think the question to be asked and what we learned from the Massachusetts victory is that people are sick and tired of Washington not delivering for them.  And so the question is really, will the Republican Party become--be willing to come and work with us?  A silver lining is Senator Brown said yes, he's looking forward to coming to Washington and working with the Democrats, and we're hoping that that provides new leadership within the party."
43,"MR.  GREGORY:  You raise Massachusetts and you raise this question of priorities.  This is what our recent polling found in terms of what are the priorities of the American people?  And on top of that list is not health care; in fact, it's job creation.  That was first on the list at 38 percent. There's health care at 12 percent, fourth on the list.  Why keep pushing for health care in the middle of a recession when the American people don't seem to put that at the top of the list?"
44,"MS.  JARRETT:  Well, you're assuming that it's a choice between either or. The president, from the day he was elected, has made job creation and the economy a first priority.  Let's, let's just remember where we were a year ago, David.  We were losing 700,000 jobs a month.  We were in the middle of the worst economic meltdown in our nation's history.  Our financial system was on the brink of collapse.  We had the largest federal deficit in our nation's history.  And what's happened over the last 12 months?  We're no longer losing 700,000 jobs a month.  We've cut that number by--to less than 10 percent. We've turned the economy around.  We are moving forward in the right direction."
45,MR.  GREGORY:  You can't say--I'm sorry.
46,"MS.  JARRETT:  However, however, David..."
47,MR.  GREGORY:  You can't say you've turned the economy around when there are four million jobs that have been lost on the president's watch.
48,MS.  JARRETT:  You didn't let...
49,MR.  GREGORY:  When the debt is higher and the stimulus did not produce the jobs that the administration said it would.
50,"MS.  JARRETT:  Well, I actually disagree with everything you just said. Let's, let's take a look.  We have pulled it back from the brink of disaster. That was our first and primary goal.  The president took some bold steps that were not necessarily popular, but that did stabilize the financial system. This is a long haul, David, and we are not satisfied--having any American who wants to work unemployed is something that the parent--the president takes to heart each and every day.  This isn't something that's going to be repaired in one year.  We're going to have to push forward.  But that doesn't mean we give up and that doesn't mean that jobs haven't been a top priority from day one."
51,MR.  GREGORY:  You talk about the economy.  What specifically is the president prepared to do this year to create jobs?
52,"MS.  JARRETT:  Well, as you mentioned, he's going to be giving his State of the Union address this week, on Wednesday, and he'll have an opportunity that he's looking forward to speak directly to the American people, something you know that he always enjoys doing.  And he'll be able to set forth his priorities, and they will be focusing on the middle class.  Our middle class is struggling out there.  They're frustrated, they're angry, they're working hard to try to make ends meet.  They're having to make terrible choices between paying their rent and putting food on the table and paying for their health care and sending their kids to college.  These are the same principles that the president advocated in the course of the campaign.  They're the same principles that he's carried with him throughout the course of this year.  And we've taken several bold steps over the course of the year.  The recovery act saved thousands and thousands of jobs.  There are school teachers and firemen and, and teachers all across our country, policemen, who have jobs today because of that recovery act.  We are investing in infrastructure.  We're investing in public education so that our kids can compete going forth into the next generation.  We're investing in renewable energy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.  These are all connected to the economy.  And what we have to keep in mind, David, is that, is that we need to have a sustainable, healthy, long-term economy."
53,MR.  GREGORY:  OK.
54,"MS.  JARRETT:  Not a quick fix, but a long-term, sustainable growth."
55,"MR.  GREGORY:  Here was the president on Friday in Ohio, and his, his tone was different.  He sounded more like a campaigner than he did as an incumbent president.  Let's watch a piece of that."
56,"(Videotape, January 22, 2010)"
57,PRES.  OBAMA:  I did not run for president to turn away from these challenges. I didn't run to kick these challenges down the road.  I ran for president to confront them once and for all.
58,(End videotape)
59,MR.  GREGORY:  Does this mark a new approach to how he's going to communicate with the American people during the State of the Union and beyond?
60,"MS.  JARRETT:  You know, I would ask you to go back and, and look at the speech that the president gave in September of 2007 on the floor of Nasdaq, where he's--he called for accountability.  He said that there are excesses that are running out of control.  He called for checks and balances that would stop the excessive risk taking that was going on.  That same tone is what he has had for as long as I have known him.  So no, I don't see any difference. I do see..."
61,"MR.  GREGORY:  But he, he acknowledged..."
62,MS.  JARRETT:  ...a heightened frustration.
63,"MR.  GREGORY:  But he acknowledged a, a failure of communications of sort to communicate to the concerns of the American people.  He said this this past week."
64,"MS.  JARRETT:  What he--what I saw him express on Friday was the growing frustration with Washington and the fact that what you continue to see here is an entrenched status quo where the special interest groups and the lobbyists dominate the day, and where people have lost sight of the American people that they are here to serve.  And so what you saw was some frustration and some anger because of what's happened over the course of the last year.  We are working so hard to put our country back on the right track, and what we want is partners in the Republican Party.  And we're hoping that with Senator Brown, we have that."
65,"MR.  GREGORY:  Evan Bayh, the centrist Democrat from Indiana, as you know, is among those that we've sought out in the course of this program today to get some outside voices to join the discussion.  This was the wake-up call that he described from the Massachusetts special election."
66,(Videotape)
67,"SEN.  EVAN BAYH (D-IN):  If you look at the independent voters who have bailed out on the Democratic Party in Virginia and New Jersey and now Massachusetts, they care about the economy, they think the healthcare bill was--went too far in some ways, and they care about spending and deficits.  That's one thing we can correct, starting with the president's budget and starting with the State of the Union address this week."
68,(End videotape)
69,MR.  GREGORY:  Add to that that the president's standing among independent voters is down 11 points from Election Day 2008.  The president said this week that Americans should be frustrated and angry.  Should they be frustrated and angry at him?
70,"MS.  JARRETT:  Look, he's the president of the United States.  Ultimately, he accepts responsibility and he knows that he has to move our country in a new direction.  He's said from the beginning that it's going to be tough and it's going to be challenging, and he isn't, he isn't shying away from that challenge.  He said he's going to continue to fight, and that's what he's going to do.  Every single morning he wakes up recommitted to fighting on behalf of our country.  Every night before he goes to bed, he reads letters from 10 people from all around the country, sometimes children, asking for help.  The people of America are so resilient.  They love this country."
71,MR.  GREGORY:  But do they have a...
72,MS.  JARRETT:  They're willing to work hard.
73,"MR.  GREGORY:  My question was, do they have a question to reason to be frustrated at him?"
74,"MS.  JARRETT:  They have a reason to be frustrated with everybody, because we have not delivered yet.  We're now in Washington, and so we have to change the culture here.  That's not something that's easy, it's not something that's going to happen overnight.  But certainly, they have ever reason to be frustrated.  But there was also a Washington Post poll that came out this week that said, look, if you actually show people what's in health care, for example, they're very supportive of it.  And part of the problem is, is that there's been such a distortion and such a rhetoric and such misinformation that clutters the media, that it is hard to get our message through.  Well, do we have to do a better job with that?  Absolutely."
75,"MR.  GREGORY:  There--David Plouffe, who was a campaign manager for the campaign of 2008, is now back in the fold as an adviser."
76,MS.  JARRETT:  Yes.
77,"MR.  GREGORY:  A lot being made of that.  Was the president upset that, in effect, he was too surprised by what happened in Massachusetts?  Did his political team let him down?"
78,"MS.  JARRETT:  You know, that's the game that Washington likes to always play. David Plouffe has been a regular adviser to the president throughout the course of the year.  He ran a magnificent campaign.  He's been off writing a book and on a book tour, and now that that's running to a close the president asked him to come back.  The president has full support of his team, and that team will work closely with David Plouffe.  He's value added, and we're delighted to have him back."
79,"MR.  GREGORY:  You're not hit, hitting the reset button here?"
80,"MS.  JARRETT:  No, we're not hitting the reset button at all.  David is, David is terrific.  We're going to engage him.  And I think Washington's always looking to have somebody out and somebody in.  That's not the way this president leads.  He's always looking for new talent.  He looks for new talent in the Republican Party."
81,"MR.  GREGORY:  The president came into office promising change.  In his first year, what has he changed?"
82,"MS.  JARRETT:  Well, I think what we've seen is a, a dramatic difference in terms of how the United States is perceived around the world.  I think that the president has been able to travel across the world and to establish relationships with world leaders that lie--lay a foundation for keeping America safe and, and making us a partner around the world so that we can tackle challenges collectively with other world leaders.  I think that he has pulled back the economy from the brink of disaster.  That's an enormous amount of change when you consider where we were a year ago, right on the economic brink.  And he's adding discipline in government to try to get control of our--over our fiscal house.  So I think we've seen enormous change."
83,"MR.  GREGORY:  Valerie Jarrett, thank you very much."
84,"MS.  JARRETT:  Oh, you're welcome, David."
85,MR.  GREGORY:  Let me turn now to Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
86,"Leader, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS."
87,"SEN.  MITCH McCONNELL (R-KY):  Glad to be with you, David."
88,MR.  GREGORY:  Is there one Republican who will support any Democratic healthcare initiative?
89,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Well, what we really need to do is start over.  I mean, I--the message in Massachusetts was absolutely clear.  The exit polls that I looked at said 48 percent of the people in Massachusetts said they voted for the new senator over health care. Only 5 percent mentioned any other issue. The American people had a victory in Massachusetts, and they were sending us the message ""stop and start over."""
90,"The first thing we ought to do is go back to what the president said in 2007, let's have the C-SPAN cameras in the room.  Number two, let's concentrate on cost, which is what the American people would like us to address.  And a good place to start there is with junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals, which were not even a part of the proposal.  Absolutely, it's time to start over and go step-by-step to address the issue that the American people thought we..."
91,MR.  GREGORY:  So let me just be clear.  There is not one Republican that would vote for any Democratic healthcare reform initiative that's out there now?
92,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Well, this comprehensive bill?  Of course not.  You know, the American people are overwhelmingly opposed to it."
93,MR.  GREGORY:  So it sounds like...
94,SEN.  McCONNELL:  What we need to do...
95,MR.  GREGORY:  ...the party of no charge is well deserved.
96,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  No, no.  What I said we need to do--I just said it.  We need to, we need to stop and start over and go step-by-step..."
97,MR.  GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
98,SEN.  McCONNELL:  ...to fix the cost problem.
99,MR.  GREGORY:  So what elements of the president's reform plan would you keep as part of comprehensive healthcare reform?
100,SEN.  McCONNELL:  We'd have to sit down and discuss that.  But it's...
101,"MR.  GREGORY:  Well, we've been discussing it for months now."
102,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Well, the problem is we haven't been a part of the discussion.  We've had a number of different ideas, none of which are in the bill."
103,MR.  GREGORY:  How many Republicans were negotiating on the Finance Committee?
104,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Well, several."
105,MR.  GREGORY:  Right.  So weren't they part of the process from the start?
106,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Yeah.  But it's not just about talking, it's about what you end up with."
107,MR.  GREGORY:  Right.
108,SEN.  McCONNELL:  And from a policy...
109,MR.  GREGORY:  What did they say yes to in the course of that negotiation?
110,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  From a policy, from a policy point of view, what this ended up being was a $2.5 trillion bill that cut Medicare by half a trillion dollars, raised taxes by half a trillion dollars, would drive up insurance premiums for most Americans.  That's not reform.  And that didn't have much appeal to Republican senators."
111,"MR.  GREGORY:  So tick off the top three points of the Republican plan for, for healthcare reform."
112,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  First, you do have to do it on a bipartisan basis.  You put the C-SPAN cameras in the room, as the president said.  You start with junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals, interstate competition among insurance companies, and many of my members would be looking--would be willing to look at equalizing the tax code.  Right no w if you're a corporation and you provide insurance for your employees, you get to deduct it on your corporate tax return.  But if you're an individual on the individual market, you don't. Step-by-step to work on the cost problem.  That's what Republicans are willing to do."
113,MR.  GREGORY:  Is universal coverage a priority?
114,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Expanding coverage is a good idea.  But even under this $2.5 trillion monstrosity, they still didn't end up covering everybody.  That is easier said than done.  But if you equalize the tax code, you make it more possible for more people who are currently uninsured to, to purchase insurance.  Right now they have no tax incentive to do it.  And a lot of young people look at the situation, say, ""Gee, I'm going to live forever, why should I buy it?"""
115,MR.  GREGORY:  Is healthcare reform dead?
116,SEN.  McCONNELL:  This particular bill deserves to be stopped.  What we need to do is start over and get it right.
117,"MR.  GREGORY:  But my question was, you're looking at the votes, you're looking at the landscape; is healthcare reform dead?"
118,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Well, the Democrats are in the majority.  They have the White House, they have the House, they have the Senate.  They have to decide whether they want to listen to the voices of the American people.  All the surveys all across the country--and even in the most liberal state in America, arguably, Massachusetts--the people are telling us, ""Please don't pass this bill."" Now, if they get past this arrogant phase that they've been stuck in for about a year that, ""We know best.  We don't want to listen to public opinion here, we want to `make history,'"" if they can work their way past that and concentrate on the real problem, which is the cost, we're willing to look at it.  But I think we need to be concentrating on the economy."
119,"Look, we passed a stimulus bill.  The, the goal there was to keep unemployment at 8 percent.  It's now 10 percent, in my state 10.6 percent.  Let's concentrate on what the American--you showed the survey earlier in your program of what people would like for us to be working on, and that's job creation."
120,"MR.  GREGORY:  I just--before we get to, to jobs, I just want to ask you quickly, it sounds like you're saying there still may be some, some reason for hope here, that the president can cobble together and agreement to actually get healthcare reform through.  Is that your view?"
121,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  What I, what I hope is that this current bill that we've had on the table is finished, over."
122,MR.  GREGORY:  Right.  But you're not pronouncing it finished.
123,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Well, the majority ought to make that--reach that decision. It ought to be over.  The American people are telling us, ""Please stop trying to pass this."""
124,"MR.  GREGORY:  You talk about jobs.  Before we get to that, a key issue coming up, as I mentioned, is Ben Bernanke's renomination.  Will you vote for him as head of the Fed?"
125,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Well, he's going to have bipartisan support in the Senate, and I would anticipate he'd be confirmed."
126,MR.  GREGORY:  Will you vote for him?
127,SEN.  McCONNELL:  He's going to have bipartisan support...
128,MR.  GREGORY:  But you won't say how you'll vote?
129,SEN.  McCONNELL:  ...in the Senate.  I'll let you know in the next day or so.
130,MR.  GREGORY:  Do you have concerns about his renomination?
131,SEN.  McCONNELL:  He's--I think he's going to be confirmed.
132,MR.  GREGORY:  But do you have concerns about his renomination?
133,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Some of my members do, but I think he's going to be confirmed."
134,MR.  GREGORY:  All right.  Let me ask you about jobs.  What is the GOP plan to create jobs?
135,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Well, the first thing you do is you stop this job killing healthcare bill, and you don't pass the energy tax that passed the House earlier this year.  Their prescription for new jobs is obviously higher taxes. Don't do that.  You've got tax relief that was passed a number of years ago expiring next year.  Don't raise taxes in the middle of a recession.  Look, if I'm running a small business, David, and I'm trying to figure out what to do next year, I'd like to expand employment, but I'm looking at the potential for healthcare taxes, I'm looking at the potential of income taxes going up, dividend taxes going up, capital gains taxes going up.  The cost of adding employees is bothering me.  And then I see the administration rattling the markets on top of it.  You know, if you sum up the first year, what this administration has done best is rattle the markets, advocate tax increases and run up deficits.  That's not a very comforting message to business people looking at trying to expand employment."
136,"MR.  GREGORY:  The president's also looking at the long-term fiscal health of the United States.  He wants to put together a bipartisan commission that will look at the possibility of either tax increases or budget cuts or both, but long-term budget health.  Will you support that?"
137,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  I think a spending commission is a good idea.  I've been advocating it all year.  We're going to have votes on several different forms of that in the, in this very next week in the Senate.  Spending is the problem.  I do worry that if we construct this commission in the wrong way, it will be kind of an indirect way to raise taxes.  I've already indicated what I've said earlier today, that raising taxes in the middle of a recession's not a good idea.  We don't want this to end up doing that.  What we need is a spending reduction commission.  Get spending down."
138,"MR.  GREGORY:  You said that the Republicans would always choose bipartisan solutions when they were available.  And yet the one statement from a Republican this year, Senator DeMint, that health care would be Obama's Waterloo, to many people signals the approach that Republicans have taken, which is oppose the president at all costs, just stand in the way of his agenda.  Is that constructive?"
139,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Look, we have a hundred members of the Senate.  All of them have different points of view about every issue.  My view is that this is not about the president, this is about the country.  And if you look at the first year of this administration, we haven't made much progress.  You know, we passed a deficit--a budget that doubles the national debt in five years and triples it in 10, tried to pass energy taxes, tried to pass healthcare taxes. I--what I hope we're going to hear from the president next Wednesday night is an indication that he'd like to go in a, in a different direction.  And as I've said all year, if he wants to meet us in the middle of the political spectrum, we'll be there to help him."
140,"MR.  GREGORY:  Well, this is how you're characterizing President Obama's first year.  How would you characterize the performance of Republicans?"
141,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  What we did is--this year is try to operate on principle. The president made a decision to go hard left.  That's why he doesn't have many of my members.  If he chooses to govern in the middle, I think he'll have much broader cooperation from Republicans."
142,"MR.  GREGORY:  We talked about Scott Brown's surprising victory in Massachusetts.  The celebration went forth from Massachusetts throughout the political world.  It was an indication that perhaps a Time magazine cover from earlier in the year might have been wrong.  This was Time magazine in May.  It had the GOP as an endangered species.  Maybe the party's gotten a big shot in the arm here.  But look at this in terms of confidence in Republican leadership, from our recent poll.  To make the right decisions, confidence in congressional Republicans, 75 percent, three quarters say they have some or none.  Are the American people ready to return to Republican leadership?"
143,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  I think the most significant question is what's call a party generic ballot question.  If the election were held today, would you vote for the Democrat or the Republican candidate for Congress?  On the day the president was sworn in, my party was down 15.  A couple of weeks ago we were up 4.  I, I think the American people are never permanently in the camp of either party, never permanent.  They're looking at performance.  They want to know what we're going to do for them.  And I think the reason that you had the victories in Virginia and New Jersey and most improbably in Massachusetts, of all places, was the American people are saying, ""We want to go in a different direction."" I hope the president will get the message and change direction, and we'll begin to see that next Wednesday night."
144,"MR.  GREGORY:  Does the Republican Party, in this election year, need what the Republicans had in 1994, which is a contract with America, as they did in '94, to get 300 Republicans to sign up for no new taxes and a balanced budget?  Do you see that as being a necessity this year?"
145,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Yeah, I think we will have a plan.  We've had a plan, an alternate plan, on everything this year, and I think we'll have an alternate plan for the voters in, in November."
146,MR.  GREGORY:  So you will have a contract with America for 2010?
147,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Well, I don't know what it, what it'll be called.  And of course, every race is different.  You know, running in New England is different from running in the West.  Senate races are typically, to some extent, custom crafted to the, to the people that, that will be voting."
148,"MR.  GREGORY:  The Supreme Court decision this week to allow corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts on campaigns is getting a lot of criticism. Who do you think it benefits most, Republicans or Democrats?"
149,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Well, I don't know who it benefits, but it's an important victory for the First Amendment.  Right now if you're General Electric and you own NBC, you can say anything you want to about any candidate right up to the day of the election.  But if you're a corporation or a union that doesn't own a media outlet, you haven't been able to.  So you've had this big gap in the First Amendment applying one standard to media-owned corporations, another standard to unions and corporations that don't own media outlets.  Now the Supreme Court has said the First Amendment is for everyone.  I think that's a step in the right direction."
150,"MR.  GREGORY:  Final point here.  The president's about to give his State of the Union address.  You know, a lot people look at Washington and they say Washington doesn't work.  So beyond the partisanship, how about some constructive engagement?  What would you advise the president to do to help Washington work better in his second year?"
151,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  Look, it's about policy, not personality.  I like the president.  I like him a lot.  I think he's a terrific person.  We've had a number of meetings.  I enjoy being around him.  I like what he's doing in Afghanistan.  It's about policy, David.  And if the president wants to govern in the middle, there'll be Republicans there to meet him."
152,MR.  GREGORY:  What are Republicans prepared to do to be more constructive this year?
153,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  We have to see what he--you know, he's the president.  He has a right to govern.  Governing is hard work, as he has discovered.  But he, he makes the initiatives and we react to them.  And if he will move to the political center, I think he'll find a lot more Republican support than he's had in the first year."
154,MR.  GREGORY:  But he has to move before Republicans will do anything?
155,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  He's the president of the United States.  We're waiting for him to make his initiatives.  He was chosen to make the tough decisions.  He chose to go hard left the first year.  We'll see, beginning Wednesday night, where he plans to be the second year."
156,"MR.  GREGORY:  Given the, the state of the political mood right now, are there incumbent Republicans who need to worry this election year?"
157,"SEN.  McCONNELL:  I think that--as I said earlier, I don't think the voters are ever permanently in the camp of either party, and we've seen that on full display over the last couple of years.  Our candidates will be arguing for lower taxes, lower deficits and a vibrant economy, and we'll see what the American people decide in November.  If the election were held today, obviously, we'd have a very good election."
158,"MR.  GREGORY:  Leader McConnell, thank you very much."
159,SEN.  McCONNELL:  Thank you.
160,"MR.  GREGORY:  And coming up next, our roundtable sorts through it all. Weighing in on the 2010 political landscape and the Obama agenda:  E.J. Dionne, Katty Kay, Peggy Noonan and Chuck Todd.  Plus, our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE from 1976:  Advice from a senator to a president as he prepares to deliver his State of the Union address.  Only here on MEET THE PRESS."
161,(Announcements)
162,MR.  GREGORY:  Our roundtable weighs in on the political landscape and the Obama agenda after this brief commercial break.
163,(Announcements)
164,"MR.  GREGORY:  And we're back, joined now by E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post, Peggy Noonan of The Wall Street Journal, Chuck Todd of NBC News and Katty Kay of BBC World News America."
165,"Welcome to all of you.  Wow, is this a week to discuss or what?  There's so much to get to.  Let's go with Massachusetts to begin with, the question of where are we then?  Where are we now?  Here were the results comparing Massachusetts to where Obama was in 2008.  Twenty-six points he won Massachusetts by.  You fast-forward to the 2010 race, Scott Brown wins by five, that's a 31-point shift.  Look at some of the other key races we've looked at.  Virginia, that's where Obama won by seven in '08.  It's the Republican, McDonnell, wins by 18, a 25-point shift.  And New Jersey, you've got a 19-point shift, another Republican winning in an election this year compared to--this was the governor's race, of course--compared to the presidential race of 2008."
166,"Peggy Noonan, what happened?"
167,"MS.  PEGGY NOONAN:  I think America never stops being a dynamic country.  It's always exciting here.  Look, I, I think the president had difficulties in his first year.  Those shifts tell it.  I think the big message is the 2008 election settled nothing.  America is still in play.  We've got Republicans and conservatives being resurgent.  Bigger than that, I think the president is losing or has lost the independent vote and the center in the United States. That's a bad thing to happen to a presidency in a first year."
168,MR.  GREGORY:  E.J.:
169,"MR.  E.J. DIONNE:  Well, first of all, let's not overlook political incompetence here.  Martha Coakley was ahead by 31 points, the Democrat.  She ended up earning 800--she got 850,000 fewer votes than Barack Obama did in 2008.  The Democrats should've seen this coming and they didn't.  That's why I think they're bringing back David Plouffe."
170,"In a larger sense, if you look at President Obama's problem and the Democrats' problem, they're suffering at both ends.  They are losing energy from their own supporters, from progressives, and they are losing in the middle.  The independent voters voted against them in Virginia and in New Jersey, and now in Massachusetts.  And I think that double problem belies the normal talk you hear in Washington, ""Well, now we move to the center or we move to the right."" That's a really stale debate and it doesn't begin to deal with the problems Democrats have, because they've got to get energy on their side again and they've got to start winning the middle.  That's why I think they are trying--Obama, in these very forceful speeches where he's using the word ""fight"" about 100 times a day..."
171,MR.  GREGORY:  Right.
172,"MR.  DIONNE:  ...is trying to say, ""Look, we get it.  We are fighting against Wall Street."" They look like Wall Street liberals.  Now, can you imagine a worse combination than being a Wall Street liberal?"
173,MR.  GREGORY:  Right.
174,"MR.  DIONNE:  And they're trying to say, ""We're going to fight for you against them."""
175,"MR.  GREGORY:  Katty Kay, here, here's the cover of Newsweek magazine that'll hit the newsstands, and you see Barack Obama on, on the cover.  And the title there is ""The Inspiration Gap."" And it does lead to this question; the president acknowledged that he had somehow failed in his ability to communicate to the American people, to somehow connect to their concerns. Peggy, you wrote this, this column about whether he was really connected.  The obvious question is, how could that happen?  How could the great communicator of our time have failed in that fundamental goal?"
176,"MS.  KATTY KAY:  Yeah, and I think that's the question that the White House is asking right now.  That's part of whatever--if there is going to be a reset, it's going to be a reset around the issue of communication.  That there were very valid reasons for the stimulus plan, for the bank bailout, for healthcare reform in American, but the president failed to present those reasons in terms that ordinary American families could connect with.  There was almost an arrogance in the White House that ""we are doing the right thing for the American people, but we don't have to actually explain it to the American people."""
177,MR.  GREGORY:  Right.
178,"MS.  KAY:  ""We don't have to actually go to the people and say, `We need to do this, and this is why.' This is why there is a real cost if we don't enact healthcare reform, and there is a real benefit if we do enact it."" And I think that message didn't get across.  And maybe Obama came out of the election thinking, ""I have this mandate to govern this country, and because of my story and because of who I am and because of that enthusiasm and inspiration and that hope around my election, I don't actually need to go about explaining things,"" and that was a big error."
179,"MR.  GREGORY:  Yeah.  Chuck, let me bring you into this, but I want to set your comments up with this.  Politico wrote a piece this week called ""What Went Wrong,"" and this is part of it:  ""Obama and his team ...  believed that the historical cycle had turned, that voters had not only rejected George W. Bush's brash conservatism but also moved beyond Bill Clinton's tepid and defensive-minded progressivism.  ...  Obama believed that early success would be self-reinforcing, building a powerful momentum for bold government action. This belief was the essence of the White House's theory of the `big bang'--that success in passing a big stimulus package would lead to success in passing health care, which in turn would clear the way for major cap-and-trade environmental legislation and `re-regulation' of the financial services sector--all in the first year."""
180,"MR.  CHUCK TODD:  Well, this was about overlearning the lesson of Clinton, right, which is to don't sort of dillydally in one issue, right, immediately try to do a whole bunch of things."
181,"But, you know, I want to get back to the, the--something about this idea of the message problem that this White House has, because it's odd to say they have a message problem when they are out there all the time trying to sell something."
182,MS.  KAY:  Hm.
183,"MR.  TODD:  Now, part of it is they're selling, obviously, a lot of things at one time.  They got bogged down in the healthcare debate and that's no doubt, and now they're saying, ""Hey, we're out of touch, we have a message problem."" But they are going to have to deal with this issue of anger at--in government institutions.  You and I spent a lot of time over the last two years talking about this anger that the public has and lost faith they have in institutions. That hasn't gone away.  That's the, the issue here.  That's certainly the message that the president believes he received on Tuesday, which is, look, people are still upset at institutions, and he's got to figure out how to become the leader of Washington and anti-Washington at the same time, which I think's going to be incredibly difficult to do.  Ronald Reagan pulled it off because he still had a Democratic Congress..."
184,MR.  GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
185,"MR.  TODD:  ...to run against in 1982 when he was in the exact same position that Barack Obama is now.  What's odd for him is he's got to figure out how to run against his own Democratic Congress in some form or another and run against the institutions of Washington, and that's what's going to be a difficult challenge for him."
186,"MR.  GREGORY:  But, Peggy, he's also dealing with a Republican Congress that was more difficult than he even accounted for in terms of not being willing to work with him.  That's a reality."
187,"MS.  NOONAN:  That's not how Republicans in Washington see it.  They feel that their ideas say on health care, for instance, their ideas on tort reform, were simply flicked away and never really considered."
188,"Let me say, on the communications thing, the president is often out there talking, his administration is every day.  If you watch a lot of cable, it's what you see.  It is the wallpaper of your life, seeing the administration putting its case forward.  I think it's the wrong lesson to draw if you think we're not talking enough or we're not talking in the right, magical way. There is no right, magical way.  The product that you're trying to sell may be faulty.  Beyond that, part of communicating is listening.  You talk and you hear.  The administration has done a bad job the past year of hearing the response of the American people and their reservations over their biggest issue, which was health care."
189,MR.  GREGORY:  But aren't we over...
190,MS.  KAY:  Well...
191,"MR.  GREGORY:  Go ahead, Katty."
192,"MS.  KAY:  But one thing I would say is that it's hard to hear it because the message is very confused.  On the one hand, people are saying ""we want jobs, but we don't want the kind of spending that it's going to take to get those jobs.  We want you to be tougher on terrorism, but we don't necessarily want a troop build-up in Afghanistan."" So the message that we're getting from the country's confusing.  I would say there is a risk of being a little bit apocalyptic here, that thinking we have had this one result and that changes the nature everything and we have to have this major reset, and that there is a tendency amongst, you know, journalists included, to be a little bit short-term about this.  There are another 10 months to go until the midterm elections.  This is only one year of a presidency, and there is ample time.  A and maybe we should actually--and perhaps the White House needs to think this, too--step back a bit and think ""let's not be too dramatic about this."""
193,"MR.  GREGORY:  Well, we've..."
194,MR.  DIONNE:  Especially--journalists especially overate these things.
195,MR.  GREGORY:  Right.
196,"MR.  DIONNE:  I agree with you on that.  But you've got an unprecedented situation.  We've never been in a situation where everything required 60 votes in the Senate.  There was a headline in the Village Voice that said, ""Republicans Claim 41-59 Senate Majority."" That's what we have come to."
197,MS.  KAY:  Mm-hmm.
198,"MR.  DIONNE:  And I think the fact that the healthcare bill stood around there like a bottle of milk out in the kitchen for two days made it look less and less appealing to people.  And I think Democrats really face a choice here. If they walk away from this healthcare bill after voting for it in both houses, they will look very, very weak.  They're going to be stuck with those votes anyway.  I've been thinking of sailing metaphors, because of Ted Kennedy.  If one election in one state can completely blow you off course, you're not much of a sailor."
199,"MR.  GREGORY:  Well, there's no indication that they do plan to do that, right?"
200,"MR.  TODD:  No, not at all.  And it does look like--I think, this, this, this idea of the House voting the Senate bill is still very much alive.  When Nancy Pelosi said she didn't have the votes, that was a negotiating tactic.  That was a--make the liberal Democrats in the House stare into the abyss of nothing and say, ""OK, we could have nothing.  How do you want to, how do you want to do that?"" to, to get at your point."
201,"But, you know, another, I think, struggle for this White House is the fact that nobody's seeing results.  And obviously, so that's why I think, Katty, this is where the White House does sort of ascribe to this.  Hey, patience, patience, patience.  As soon as the public sees some results, then they have something to sell, because they certainly did pass a number of things, you know, and they think at some point when the economy starts turning and this and that."
202,"But I think the other fundamental mistake they made on health care is that they viewed health care, they, they forgot that it is connected to the economy.  And they would say, ""Oh, yeah, we know that."" And that anybody that's concerned about health care usually is not concerned about the care they're getting, they're concerned about their job and the fear of losing their job and therefore health care.  And, and that's maybe where they had their priority flipped around."
203,"MR.  GREGORY:  Let's talk a little bit about political conditions about the Republicans.  But first, 1994 comes up a lot as a comparison, a wave that would sweep Democrats from power as they did when Bill Clinton was president. E.J. Dionne, back in 1994, in August, this is what you had to say on this program."
204,MS.  NOONAN:  Oh!
205,MR.  TODD:  Poor E.J.
206,MR.  DIONNE:  Save me!
207,MR.  GREGORY:  Watch this.
208,"(Videotape, August 28, 1994)"
209,"MR.  DIONNE:  Why did the Democrats get into this fix and why did Clinton get into this mess?  I think that in 1992 it was very clear, and still is, that Americans are worried about a number of things.  They're worried about losing their jobs, especially if they're blue collar or middle managers, even with the economic recovery.  They don't think government works.  The Clinton of '92 addressed all of those issues.  And I think for the last year he has gotten lost in the details of health care, which chilled everybody's mind, and in Whitewater.  And I think that what he's going to have to do and what the Democrats are going to have to do if they're going to get back on track is to reconnect with all of those themes.  And I think that's what Clinton's going to spend the rest of the year doing."
210,(End videotape)
211,MR.  GREGORY:  Pretty striking.  Could the--almost the same be said today?
212,MR.  DIONNE:  That guy looked so young.  Who was that?  God love him.
213,"MR.  GREGORY:  Yeah, right, who was that?"
214,"MR.  DIONNE:  You could have embarrassed me.  That was, that was pretty good. I do think that, in fact, that is precisely what needs to happen.  Peggy mentioned there were no magic words, and I agree with that.  This is not about magic.  But if you go back to Ronald Reagan, the person that Peggy worked for so effectively, Ronald Reagan spent a lot of time not lost in the weeds of policy.  He made large arguments, and he made large arguments against the other side.  He spent a lot of time saying this old, failed liberalism doesn't work anymore.  And I think what you need from Obama--in all of the speeches he's given, he has not made a consistent argument, provided a consistent narrative of where I want to move the nation.  I think you're beginning to see that in the last few days.  And Massachusetts, it's very strange to say, could turn out to be a blessing if it leads to a course correction 10 months before the midterms.  The Democrats didn't see what was coming in '94; boy, they do now."
215,"MR.  GREGORY:  Right.  And, Peggy, it's interesting.  Lou Cannon, who you know well, the Reagan biographer, wrote this week that, you know, the conventional wisdom that somehow this is the unraveling of the Obama presidency might be wrong.  This could be--Reagan's first year, '82, was bad; landslide in '84. This is what he wrote, actually:  ""[Reagan's '84 re-election landslide] would not have happened without the economic recovery; no president is immune to prolonged economic downturn.  But Reagan's performance in '82 was also crucial.  ...  Millions of Americans responded to Reagan's unflinching optimism and believed he would do the right thing.  By that measure, if he can once again display the rousing audacity that marked the campaign for the presidency, Barack Obama can make a similar comeback."""
216,"MS.  NOONAN:  Let me tell you what I think is the difference between now and 1982.  Yes, you have two young, new, compelling presidents, and they're going through a hard time in their first year.  Here are the differences.  One, Reagan was on the same page as his public with regard to what the great issues of the day were:  the economy and national security, the Soviet Union. President Obama has not been the same page, he's been going down a different road.  Two, Reagan in '82 had a clear plan that everybody knew.  He said, ""I'm going to cut your taxes and it's going to help get us out of it.  I'm going to squeeze inflation out of the system."" Because it was a clear plan, people gave it time.  In the end, it seemed to work.  Three, Reagan was a conservative president in a center-right country.  That's not true with Mr. Obama, whose political philosophy is still, oddly, unclear in a way.  It seems to--we see the impulses of it in his programs, but we're not sure what the basic thing is.  But America remains a center-right country.  So I don't buy the parallels of '82 and now."
217,"MS.  KAY:  I would say that lack of clarity is very important, that there is a sense that people aren't confident about the leadership that they're getting from Washington.  And if you remember one of the things in the '08 election that the Republicans and, to some extent, President Bush had been criticized for was a lack of competency.  People wanted to feel that they had a, leadership that they could believe in, that was competent."
218,MS.  NOONAN:  Hm.
219,"MS.  KAY:  And I think the struggles of the last week or two have begun to make people think, is this White House competent?"
220,MS.  NOONAN:  Yes.
221,"MS.  KAY:  Are they delivering on something that is clear?  Are they actually managing to get the job done?  Where do they go next?  There's a sense of confusion, and I think that's very undermining for the president in terms of the electorate."
222,MS.  NOONAN:  Yes.  I think that...
223,"MR.  GREGORY:  There's also the issue of the sort of opposition that the president faces.  Where is the Republican Party?  We talked a little bit about that.  Again, part of the conversation we've had outside the hour today in some outside interviews includes one with Dick Armey, a former congressman who's now part of FreedomWorks, who is part of this tea party movement that was influential in Massachusetts and elsewhere.  Here's what he said about the center of American politics."
224,(Videotape)
225,"FMR.  REP.  DICK ARMEY (R-TX):  This is the broad center of American politics. Look at the polling data.  Right now the tea party polls higher than the Republicans and the Democrats.  And it is becoming increasingly clear to the electorate out there, and they're expressing their understanding, it is the Democrat majority in Congress and the president that's on the liberal fringe and we are on the center.  There's no doubt about it."
226,(End videotape)
227,"MR.  TODD:  Oh, well, I don't know if they're in the center.  I mean, when we did our own polling on this, it's clear that the tea party gets a big benefit because there's one news organization that gives them a huge bump all the time.  I mean, their favorable rating among Fox viewers is through the roof, and the rest of the country sort of doesn't know a lot about these folks.  But the message of the tea party sort of saying ""the government doesn't work, these institutions, and we've got to shrink the size of government,"" is tapping into what we were just discussing before..."
228,MR.  GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
229,"MR.  TODD:  ...which is this, this--I would--not disgust, but it's sort of this distrust of all institutions that are out there, government included. But I think that--I want to go to something E.J. said about the Republican Party.  I think the most striking thing about the minority party today vs.--that is that a Republican can't go home, and it's mostly because of this tea party crowd, cannot go home and sell a piece of pork that they got from Washington.  It is now, when you bring home something, saying, ""Hey, I brought federal dollars to this."" You're on the defensive now."
230,MR.  GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
231,"MR.  TODD:  And so that does make the president's challenge.  So it's not as if he can trade--you know, go and have these trades with a Susan Collins or Olympia Snowe, or let's say Lamar--let's go to--move over to maybe more conservative center-right, Lamar Alexander or something like this, because they're not getting a benefit at home of bringing something back."
232,MR.  GREGORY:  Right.
233,"MR.  TODD:  Because we have, like, destroyed this, this, this idea that somehow anything from government that comes through is bad."
234,"MR.  GREGORY:  Let me, let me get--E.J., just--I want to have you make your point.  But also, as we tee up the State of the Union, another voice that we consulted on the outside was Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell, former chair of the party, who offers this advice about tone and substance for the president going forward."
235,(Videotape)
236,"GOV.  ED RENDELL (D-PA):  Mr. Obama was a very fine candidate.  But most importantly, I think, our people, the, the Democratic base, the independents who supported us in the past, they want us to, to fight back, they want us to get something done.  And look, if we're going to go down in the 2010 elections, and I don't think necessarily we are, but we ought to go down fighting for something we believe in, like health care for every American."
237,(End videotape)
238,MR.  GREGORY:  Will President Obama go down fighting?
239,"MR.  DIONNE:  Well, he hopes he doesn't go down, but he will be fighting."
240,MR.  GREGORY:  Right.
241,"MR.  DIONNE:  I, I want to--the, the..."
242,"MR.  GREGORY:  But is that a new approach, the fighting part of it?  Is that..."
243,"MR.  DIONNE:  The fighting is not a word you would associated in the last year with Barack Obama.  And yet during the campaign, it's very similar to when he was fighting Mrs. Clinton in the primaries, where she was a more effective populist in those late primaries and he kind of had to learn it."
244,"But I want to go back to something Chuck said.  The--it's imperative, and this is part of the State of the Union, Democrats have to show government can work."
245,MR.  GREGORY:  Right.
246,"MR.  DIONNE:  Because their whole argument is, ""We can make the market work better, we can make the society better with careful uses of government."" If people don't believe government can work, they're not going to turn to the Democrats."
247,"On the tea party folks, what did Bob McDonnell, the new governor of Virginia, and Scott Brown have in common?  They didn't have really divisive--they didn't have divisive primaries."
248,MR.  GREGORY:  Yeah.
249,"MR.  DIONNE:  And so they could immediately run as real conservatives to the conservatives, but as problem-solving moderates to the rest of the electorate."
250,"MR.  GREGORY:  And so, Peggy..."
251,"MR.  DIONNE:  If the tea party folks give Republicans a lot of primaries, they actually are going to set the party back."
252,MR.  TODD:  Yeah.
253,"MR.  GREGORY:  All right.  But, but is Scott Brown then the hope, is he a symbol for the future of the Republican Party?"
254,"MS.  NOONAN:  Well, look, I think you got deep blue Virginia, you got Massachusetts--sorry, deep blue New Jersey, you got Virginia, a swing state, you got deep blue Massachusetts now, they all yielded up candidates who got the support of centrists, down-the-line Republicans, tea party folk.  Whatever the tea party people say operationally on Election Day, they seem to be going for candidates who, who are Republican candidates who they believe on the issues of taxing and spending."
255,"Can I throw in on the idea of institutions?  Anybody governing now has a terrible problem, because faith in institutions, all institutions--journalism, government, the church..."
256,MR.  TODD:  Sports.  I mean...
257,"MS.  NOONAN:  ...it's all way down.  So, so anybody has that built-in problem in government.  But I would throw out the idea that if you have that problem, you shouldn't be putting forward a 1,000 or 2,000-page healthcare bill in that environment."
258,MR.  GREGORY:  All right.  I'm going to have...
259,"MS.  NOONAN:  You put out a small, discreet one."
260,MR.  GREGORY:  Got to make that the last word.
261,"MS.  NOONAN:  Oh, I'm sorry."
262,MR.  GREGORY:  This will certain be continued.  That's all right.
263,"MS.  NOONAN:  Oh, I beg your pardon."
264,"MR.  GREGORY:  A programming note.  Here on Monday mornings, ""Daily Rundown"" with Chuck Todd and Savannah Guthrie on MSNBC.  They'll have an exclusive interview with Ambassador Richard Holbrooke.  That's Monday at 9 AM on MSNBC."
265,"And up next here, our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE.  January 1976, another economic crisis and another president preparing to deliver his State of the Union address.  We look back at the advice offered on this program from Democratic presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen to Republican President Gerald Ford after this brief station break."
266,(Announcements)
267,"MR.  GREGORY:  And we're back with our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE.  January 1976, another time of economic turmoil in this country, as then President Gerald Ford prepares to give his State of the Union address to an anxious nation. Unemployment had climbed to 9 percent in the preceding year, and President Ford's approval rating fell below 50 percent.  It was an election year, and in true MEET THE PRESS tradition, a steady stream of presidential candidates made appearances on the program.  Here was one of them, Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, offering advice to the Republican president he hoped to run against and defeat in the fall."
268,"(Videotape, January 18, 1976)"
269,"MR.  LAWRENCE E.  SPIVAK:  Senator Bentsen, if you were the president and had to deliver the State of the Union message, what would you list as your first domestic priority now?"
270,"SEN.  BENTSEN:  The first domestic priority is getting people back on payrolls, getting them off the unemployment roles, back where they're contributing to their families and contributing to doing away with this deficit that we're facing.  You know, to have the head of the family home and the kids saying, ""What's wrong with dad?  Why isn't he working?"""
271,"What they're really trying to do in this economy of ours is to keep their foot on the brake of the economy, and I don't think we should be doing that.  We should be creating opportunity.  What people are really looking for in this country is a return of self-confidence.  I believe I could make a contribution there and a very major one."
272,(End videotape)
273,"MR.  GREGORY:  While Bentsen ultimately gained little traction in his presidential bid, the eventual Democratic nominee, a little-known Jimmy Carter, went on to narrowly win the White House later that year.  As for Senator Bentsen, he went on to become the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 1988, and later served as President Bill Clinton's Treasury secretary.  He died in 2006 at the age of 85."
274,And we'll be right back.
275,(Announcements)
276,"MR.  GREGORY:  And before we go this morning, a programming note.  Still--stay with NBC News and MSNBC Wednesday night for full coverage of the president's State of the Union address."
277,"That's all for today.  We'll be back next week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday:  The State of the Union and a new start for the president after a rough first year.
    "
1,(Videotape)
2,PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  I don't quit.
3,(End videotape)
4,"MR. GREGORY:  With a renewed focus on jobs and the economy, is healthcare reform dead?  Plus, the Massachusetts message clearly heard, growing frustration with the way Washington works as the president tries to engage the other side in a face-to-face policy debate open to cameras."
5,(Videotape)
6,"REP. JEB HENSARLING:  Now very soon, Mr. President, you're due to submit a new budget, and my question is..."
7,"PRES. OBAMA:  Jim***(as spoken), I know there's a question in there somewhere, because you're making a whole bunch of assertions, half of which I disagree with."
8,(End videotape)
9,"MR. GREGORY:  But can the two sides work together?  Will there be give and take?  We'll speak to two men central to making that happen:  the president's senior adviser, David Axelrod, and the House Republican leader, Congressman John Boehner of Ohio."
10,"Then our roundtable weighs in on the president's focus on jobs and his political standing:  The New York Times' David Brooks, CNBC's David Faber, The Washington Post's Eugene Robinson, and U.S. News & World Report's Mort Zuckerman."
11,"And in our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE, we look back to a time not too long ago when both sides engaged more openly in policy dialogue, the majority and minority leaders of the Senate side-by-side together in one or their frequent MEET THE PRESS appearances."
12,"But first, here with us exclusively this morning, David Axelrod, senior adviser to the president."
13,Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
14,"MR. DAVID AXELROD:  Thanks, David.  Good to be here."
15,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to begin with some news this morning.  First, the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind behind 9/11, has the administration reversed its stance and decided not to transfer him to New York for trial?"
16,"MR. AXELROD:  We've made no decisions on that, David.  I've seen the reports. We've made no decisions on that yet.  Look, here's the situation:  The attorney general and the Defense Department worked out protocols about how these cases should be handled.  Under those protocols, the attorney general decided to bring Khalid Sheikh Mohammed back to New York to stand trial for his crime for the murder of 3,000 innocent people, and he wanted to do it near the, the site of, of the crime itself.  He wanted to do what the Bush administration did over and over and over again and try these people in--try these murderers in, in Article III court where these--and, and that's what he decided to do.  The local authorities were receptive to that at the time. Since then, as you know, the mayor and the police chief and others have changed their minds and said they thought it would be too logistically difficult and too expensive.  We have to take that into consideration, and we're doing that now."
17,MR. GREGORY:  What does the president think?  New York in or out?
18,"MR. AXELROD:  The president believes that we need to take into consideration what the local authorities are saying.  But he also believes this:  He believes that we ought to, to, to bring Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and all others who are involved in terrorist acts to justice swift and sure in the American justice system.  Now, we have a military commission system and that has its place, but we ought to bring people to justice.  The Bush administration tried 190 or more terrorists in that system.  During that period, Mr. Boehner and others had nothing to say about that, they were all supportive.  When we tried Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, in the, in the civilian courts for his crime, when we tried the 20th bomber, 9/11 conspirator, Moussaoui, in Virginia for his crime, nobody said anything.  In fact, Rudy Giuliani said he was in awe of the American justice system.  Mr. Cheney said this was the way to do it.  Now we have a Democratic president and suddenly we hear this--these protests, and it doesn't make sense.  And you ought to clarify what has changed between now and then that would cause people to reverse their positions 180."
19,"MR. GREGORY:  So, bottom line, what are the chances it stays in New York?"
20,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, obviously, as I said, we have to take into consideration the concerns of the local authorities in New York, and we will do so."
21,"MR. GREGORY:  Still on the, the question of terrorism, there's a lot of criticism leveled at the administration for the fact that the shoe--the, the, the bomber, the Christmas Day bomber, was read his Miranda rights after some only 50 minutes of questioning, and he was read those rights without the approval of senior officials in the administration who would have authority over that.  How big of a concern is that for the president?"
22,"MR. AXELROD:  That is not, that is not--let's clarify what happened with him. He was interrogated by FBI interrogators.  They came back later, he was unwilling to submit to questioning.  But over time, they have had additional opportunities to question.  And we'll see.  I, I, I would suggest that everybody wait and see the, the disposition of this case, because my sense is that he has given very valuable information to, to the government about activities in Yemen and some of his experiences there.  And that--and we have not lost anything as a result of how his case has been handled."
23,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me move on to domestic matters and that pretty extraordinary appearance on Friday in Baltimore at the House Republican retreat.  The president came there, a kind of British style question-and-answer period.  He even gets the blueprint for the Republican agenda from the House side.  I wonder whether the decision to accept that invitation was a recognition on the president's part that if he wants to be more than a one-term president, he's got to govern from the middle?"
24,"MR. AXELROD:  You know, David, I'd say a few things about that.  First of all, the decision to attend was not a last-minute decision on our part, it was, it was, it was on the calendar, we were aware of it.  The Republican caucus had been good enough to extend that invitation.  And this is something that--we had visited the caucus before.  But it's interesting the way you asked the question:  Does he, does he--did he do it because he wants to be more than a one-term president?  We don't sit around in the White House making calculations on that basis.  The president of the United States has one concern, which is how do we move this country forward, how do we get people back to work, how do we lift incomes, how do we build some security for the middle class who have been facing economic challenges not just through this recession but for a decade or more?  And, and that's what he's thinking about. And if we can get some cooperation from the other side to do that, we're going to be a stronger country for it.  That's why he went to the caucus, and that's why we're going to continue to have a dialogue with Mr. Boehner and others."
25,"MR. GREGORY:  Does he feel, does he feel like he has to move to the middle to achieve?"
26,"MR. AXELROD:  Again, I don't think this is a question of left, right or center, this is a question of what, what--what's--what works.  How do we--now we've proposed, for example, tax cuts for small business.  We, we, we passed without, frankly, the help of the Republican caucus, we passed 25 tax cuts last year, mostly aimed at the middle class and small businesses.  The president's come back and said, ""We need to do more."" We've, we've gone from a period of rapid descent in our economy to, as we saw on Friday, six percent growth.  But the job production has to be accelerated.  And so he said, ""Let's give a tax cut to small businesses to begin hiring--to encourage hiring."" That was an idea that Mr. Cantor, Mr. Boehner's deputy, said was a good idea at one time, and he said that they would follow if we would lead on it.  He said, ""Let's eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses."" He said, ""Let's accelerate the tax break that businesses get for buying equipment so that they can, they can reap the benefit of it next year."" Also, something that will encourage growth in--job growth.  These are things we ought to be able to work together on, and we--and I hope we can."
27,MR. GREGORY:  You've talked about a price for Republicans if they continue to block the president's agenda.  What should that price be?  What will it be?
28,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, I think there's a price for both parties if the impression is what we're more interested in our own jobs than we are in the jobs of the American people, if we play politics on every single issue.  I'll give you an example.  We believe that in the near--in the, in the mid and long term, we have to deal with these deficits, that's why the president has proposed a, a freeze on domestic discretionary spending, something that the Republican leadership actually suggested when we had a bipartisan meeting some weeks ago.  But when a measure came up in the Senate this week, or this past week, for a bipartisan commission, a statutory commission to deal with the fiscal crisis--because we understand we can only deal with that together--it lost by seven votes, and the seven votes were seven Republican co-sponsors of that amendment who then walked away from their own proposal.  Well, we have to get serious about this.  So I think the American people will punish any party who they believe is playing politics ahead of solving problems, and, and they should."
29,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think the Republicans want the president to fail?  Do they want the economy to fail?
30,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, that's a question you should ask Mr. Boehner.  I, I don't believe that--I don't--I'm not going to make that allegation here.  I, I hope that's not the case.  All I know is that in the first year of our administration, they largely sat on the sidelines on a lot of these issues. We have taken--we have had some discussions, we have incorporated some of, some of their ideas.  But moving forward, I hope that the spirit is we are all Americans, we have great problems to solve, let's work together, and let's make putting Americans back to work more important than scoring political points."
31,MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about health care.  The president speaking to Congress a year before the State of the Union said this about healthcare reform.
32,"(Videotape, February 24, 2009)"
33,"PRES. OBAMA:  So let there be no doubt, healthcare reform cannot wait, it must not wait, and it will not wait another year."
34,(End videotape)
35,MR. GREGORY:  Is the reality now that it has to wait?
36,"MR. AXELROD:  No, I don't think so.  And I think that--and I don't think that's what the American people are saying.  If--you know, I, I don't like to make polling the, the gospel, but it's all very consistent.  The American people aren't saying let's walk away from health insurance reform.  They've seen their premiums double in the last 10 years.  They understand that if they have pre-existing conditions, they can't get insurance.  They understand that if they become seriously ill, they're, they're subject to being thrown off their insurance.  They know what their out-of-pocket costs are doing.  And they know that this is a long-term threat to their families, businesses and the government.  They want us to act.  They want us--they'd like us to work together to do it.  And in fact, we've incorporated a number of the main Republican ideas into our proposal."
37,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to get to that in just a minute.  Mary Landrieu, conservative Democrat from Louisiana, said it's on life support, health care. Is it on life support?"
38,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, I, I hope for the, for the sake of the American people and the tens of millions of people out there who are, who are disadvantaged in their relationship with their insurance companies today or who have no insurance, I hope that's not the case.  Again, this is a situation where we ought to put the economic interests of everyday Americans ahead of the politics of the moment.  And that's what the president's saying.  These are extraordinary times.  Middle-class families and people who want to be middle class are struggling all over this country.  Let's, let's, let's provide some help."
39,"MR. GREGORY:  Is the president clear-eyed, though, that there's still a chance this is not going to happen?"
40,"MR. AXELROD:  The president is determined that we deal with the problems in front of us, and health care is one of those problems."
41,"MR. GREGORY:  One of the debates about spending has to do with the other side of it, which is tax relief.  The president's very clear that he wants to let the Bush tax cuts expire, doesn't want to tax anybody--or wants to keep--wants taxes to go up, those making above $250,000.  What tax relief would the president consider?"
42,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, first of all, the president has said that, that he thinks that we ought to continue those portions of the tax cuts that apply to the middle class.  The middle class has struggled mightily in this economy and for some time before.  He, he's also--he, he initiated--the, the Republican caucus voted against it, but he initiated a tax cut for 95 percent of the American people, the make work pay cut--tax cut.  He wants, he wants to continue that in the, in the next budget.  He's proposed tax cuts for, for child care, to help working families.  He's--and a series of other things that would help give some, some assistance to people in a very difficult time here.  And we, we hope to get some cooperation on all of that."
43,"MR. GREGORY:  During the State of the Union, there, there was a moment that got a lot of attention--I want to show it to you here--where the president was critical of the Supreme Court decision about campaign finance reform.  And in the audience, Justice Alito had a, what seemed to be a pretty critical response, as the line was said.  He's shaking his head there.  And then as it gets closer, it looks like he's saying, ""That's not true."" Was it appropriate for the president to criticize the Supreme Court during the State of the Union?  And do you consider Justice Alito's response to be appropriate or inappropriate?"
44,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, I certainly think it was appropriate for the president to talk about the threat that this decision brings to our democracy.  Basically, it's going to be open season for special interest groups and big corporations to participate in our elections with all their might and all their money.  And that includes foreign--domestic branches of foreign-owned businesses, even government--foreign government-owned businesses.  In fact, some of the, some of those companies signaled on Friday, according to The Wall Street Journal, that they're going to lobby vigorously against any effort to rein this in."
45,"One thing we ought to be able to agree on, and, and maybe we can here today, is that we shouldn't have foreign-owned businesses and foreign--you know, Hugo Chavez should not be playing in American political campaigns.  And I, for the life of me, don't understand why we wouldn't make that illegal."
46,"MR. GREGORY:  That moment, though, was that the appropriate forum?"
47,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, this is a big--one of the things that we face, David, and one of the things the American people recognize is that we have too much influence of special interests in the decision making here in, in Washington."
48,"MR. GREGORY:  But the question I'm asking, David, is whether that was an..."
49,"MR. AXELROD:  But, but this..."
50,MR. GREGORY:  ...appropriate criticism.
51,"MR. AXELROD:  But this, this, this is central to that.  If you're going to deliver a message on the State of the Union, then one of the things you have to address is how do we get--how do we free our government from the grips of special interests?  We, for example, proposed that every lobbyist disclose who they have contact with, whether it's in the administration or contact--or Congress, on behalf of their clients.  We have to take some steps to protect our, our government, our democracy from the overweening influence of special interests."
52,MR. GREGORY:  You still haven't answered whether you think it was an appropriate thing--criticism of the president.
53,"MR. AXELROD:  I, I think it was totally appropriate."
54,MR. GREGORY:  And Alito's response?
55,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, I--look, we--in this weird political season, we've become accustomed to unusual outbursts in the chamber during these speeches, so."
56,"MR. GREGORY:  Final question, is the country better off than it was a year ago?"
57,"MR. AXELROD:  Look, until--obviously, in some ways, the answer is yes.  We--a year ago we were losing 700,000 jobs a month.  We are, are--when the president took office, our economy was shrinking at a rate of 6.4 percent.  Last Friday, we learned it's growing now at a rate of 6 percent.  The job loss has--is one-tenth of what it was.  But until people are working, until incomes are growing, until there's a sense of stability and economic security on the part of the middle class, we've got a lot of work to do."
58,"MR. GREGORY:  David Axelrod, thank you, as always, for being here."
59,MR. AXELROD:  Great to be here.
60,MR. GREGORY:  Appreciate it.
61,"I want to turn now right to the leader of the Republicans in the House, Congressman John Boehner."
62,"Leader, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.  You heard..."
63,"REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH):  David, good to be with you."
64,"MR. GREGORY:  You heard David Axelrod say that any party, including the Republicans, will be punished if they continue to stand in the way of the president's agenda.  What do you say?"
65,"REP. BOEHNER:  Listen, there are parts of the president agenda that, that we've been supportive of.  But as a political party and in the minority on the Hill, we have an obligation to the American people to stand on principle. That's why we've all stood and voted against a stimulus bill that was supposed to be about creating jobs immediately, yet three million Americans have lost their job.  President said it wouldn't--unemployment wouldn't exceed 8 percent, now it's over 10.  Whether it's his budget with trillion-dollar deficits for as far as the eye can see, their national energy tax that they call cap-and-trade, or this government takeover of health care, Republicans have an obligation to stand on principle and to fight these proposals, but, but, at the same time, to offer better solutions.  We've offered better solutions all year long on all these major policies.  But we're not going to be bashful about walking away from our principles."
66,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let's bring some of that down.  But first, what was your overall impression--we see the, the appearance on Friday, shaking hands with the president, taking questions.  A pretty unusual forum, you haven't seen that a lot.  What was your overall impression of the president?"
67,"REP. BOEHNER:  I thought it was a very good afternoon.  We invited the president to come because we wanted to have a dialogue, and we're glad that the president accepted.  I thought our members were honest, and I thought the president was honest.  It's not that we're going to agree on everything.  But the American people sent us all here to Washington to, to do what we can to help solve the problems we have in our country."
68,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let's talk about solving problems.  This is one of the points that the president made, chastising Republicans in terms of coming together to deal constructively with issues.  This is what he said."
69,"(Videotape, January 29, 2010)"
70,"PRES. OBAMA:  We're not going to be able to do anything about any of these entitlements if what we do is characterized, whatever proposals are put out there, as, ""Well, you know, that's--the other party's being irresponsible. The other party's trying to hurt old--our senior citizens."" That the other party is doing X, Y, Z.  That's why I say if we're going to frame these debates in ways that allow us to solve them, then we can't start off by figuring out, A, who's to blame; B, how can we make the American people afraid of the other side?"
71,(End videotape)
72,"MR. GREGORY:  And to that point, I mean, even here you're talking about deficits and debt as far as the eye can see, when you know full well that the president owns a very small percentage, comparatively, of that overall debt as far as the eye can see."
73,REP. BOEHNER:  No.
74,MR. GREGORY:  Does he have a point?
75,"REP. BOEHNER:  No.  If, if you think about what I said, I was referring to the--all the president's policies.  Wasn't demonizing him, wasn't demonizing the White House.  And I'm usually very careful about dealing with the subject at hand.  Listen, there aren't that many places where we can come together. The president is--well, he was the most liberal member of the United States Senate.  You don't get there by accident.  And if you look at the policies that we've seen over the course of this year from the administration and his Democratic colleagues in Congress, they're all these leftist proposals.  And the people of Massachusetts, the people of Virginia, the people of New Jersey are sending a pretty loud signal, just like the other 47 states, to the--to Washington, saying, ""Stop!  This is, this is way more than we ever wanted Washington to do."""
76,"MR. GREGORY:  Although the president took on this idea of it being leftist policies on health care, indicating that it was, in fact, the move to the center and cost containment that cost him some of the, the support among--within his own party.  My question is, if you--you heard the president, in the State of the Union, say that saying no is short-term good politics, but it's not leadership.  You heard the State of the Union, you heard the president's Friday address.  What are you prepared to say yes to, specifically?"
77,"REP. BOEHNER:  Leadership is about standing on your principle and, and opposing those policies that, that we believe are bad for the country.  But leadership is also standing up and offering what we think is a better solution.  And when it comes to issues like health care, the president did his best to blur the differences, agreeing with us on five or six points, but didn't refer to the other 100 commissions, boards, mandates that are in this government takeover of health care."
78,"MR. GREGORY:  What are a few things that the president could do--maybe he could convene Republicans and Democrats together on C-SPAN, as he said he would initially, and acknowledge that it was a mistake that he did not fulfill that promise during the Friday retreat, get everybody together.  What are a few things that Republicans could say, ""Hey, if these could be included, we could vote for this""?"
79,"REP. BOEHNER:  Well, I'll give you an example.  Last year I told the president, you know, what--when we can be with you and when we agree with you, we will stand tall with you, as we did on Afghanistan, as we did on Iraq, as we did on things like teacher quality and a number of other areas.  But when it comes to, when it comes to health care, we could agree on a some commonsense steps to make our healthcare system work better.  But we are not going to put the government in charge of people's health care.  And, and it, it's something that there's a fundamental difference here.  And most of American has already said no to this big government takeover."
80,"MR. GREGORY:  It's interesting.  You say you don't want government in charge of health care, and yet you're a supporter of the idea of portable health insurance, the ability to take health insurance across state lines.  But I thought the Republicans were states' rights guys and didn't want--because you'd have to have some kind of federal regulatory agency to monitor that kind of portability, wouldn't you?"
81,"REP. BOEHNER:  No, you wouldn't have to."
82,MR. GREGORY:  Really?  Because that's...
83,REP. BOEHNER:  What we're saying is the American people ought to buy health insurance across state lines.  They ought to buy health insurance where they get the policy that they need for themselves and their family at the best price.
84,"MR. GREGORY:  And there wouldn't have to be some sort of federal regulatory system to, to receive that?"
85,"REP. BOEHNER:  Well, no.  That's the whole point.  The president said, ""Well, I'm for that.  But, you know, there'd have to be some bureaucrat here in Washington that needs to make sure that this is done fairly."" The American people are smart enough to do this on their own."
86,MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about health care.  Is it dead?
87,"REP. BOEHNER:  No.  We've seen all week, Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Reid continuing to scheme and plot, trying to find some way to get their big government takeover of health care enacted.  And so I do think they're having problems, but I think Republicans are going to continue to be vigilant in exposing this.  And I think the American people need to stay engaged because I'm watching all of, all of the, the movement on the Hill.  They're still trying to find a way, even after Massachusetts, the election there, they're still trying to find a way to shove this down the throats of the American people.  And the American people are saying, ""No, stop!"" And what we need to do is scrap the big government takeover bill and let's start over.  Let's start over on commonsense steps that we can do--we can take to make our system work better."
88,"No one in Washington thinks our current healthcare system is perfect, and certainly not Republicans.  We've outlined our eight or nine ideas about how we can make it work better.  But we want to preserve the best healthcare system in the world, and we don't want the government to take control of it."
89,"MR. GREGORY:  The, the question of spending and, and commonsense steps that could be taken, you heard David Axelrod say, ""Look, the Republicans voted against paying as you go.  They voted against a commission to control the debt."" They suggest a spending freeze, the president's budget will.  And Speaker Pelosi has said that should not exempt defense spending, it should include it.  What do you say?  Should the spending freeze be a good start but be expanded?"
90,"REP. BOEHNER:  I think the president's proposal on freezing nonsecurity domestic spending is a good first step, but it's only $15 billion for each of the next three years.  I think we can do much better than that.  I don't think any agency of the federal government should be exempt from rooting out wasteful spending or unnecessary spending.  And I, frankly, I would agree with it at the Pentagon.  There's got to be wasteful spending there, unnecessary spending there.  It all ought to be eliminated, and we should be going through this budget line by line and, and asking the question, is this spending worth having to borrow money that our kids and grandkids are going to have to pay back?  That's the real question.  And if we went through the budget line by line like that, I think there's a lot more spending that we could cut."
91,"MR. GREGORY:  Let, let me ask you about the prospect of Republican leadership.  In The New York Times today, front page, is this story, as the GOP hits its stride, pitfalls await.  And this is a portion of that piece. ""At a moment of what appears to be great if unexpected opportunity, the Republican Party continues to struggle with disputes over ideology and tactics, as well as what party leaders say is an absence of strong figures to lead it back to power, from the party chairman to prospective presidential candidates."""
92,Are Republicans too fractured to seize this moment and return to power?
93,"REP. BOEHNER:  Listen, we have, we have our share of differences within our party, but I, I don't see any big fractures that are out there.  What we're trying to do here in Washington is to show the American people that we've learned our lessons in terms of too much spending.  And what we've tried to demonstrate over the course of the, of the last year is a real sense of fiscal responsibility, a real sense that Republicans need to show the American people that we can stand on principle and that we are the party of better solutions."
94,"MR. GREGORY:  But with the tea party out there, who is the--what's the leader in the Republican--who's the leader in the Republican Party now to lead a charge with a new Contract With America, say?"
95,"REP. BOEHNER:  David, we're not, there's not going to be a leader in the Republican Party until we have a presidential candidate.  In the meantime, there are going to be a lot of people leading.  There are going to be a lot of flowers out there blooming.  And I think that's good for our party and, frankly, good for the country."
96,MR. GREGORY:  Do you support Michael Steele as chairman of the party?
97,"REP. BOEHNER:  He's been elected as the chairman of the party.  I've worked closely with him.  It's not that I agree with everything that he does, but he's, by and large, he's doing a pretty good job."
98,MR. GREGORY:  So you support him in his role?
99,REP. BOEHNER:  I do.
100,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me show you something from our Wall Street Journal which is interesting in terms of blame.  ""Who do you blame for not finding solutions"" in Washington?  Republicans get the lion's share of this, certainly more than President Obama.  Why do you think that is?"
101,"REP. BOEHNER:  Well, it's one of the reasons why we put this book together, so you and the president and others can't continue to call us the ""party of no,"" the ""party of no ideas."" We've worked very hard over the last year to make sure that if we had to disagree with our Democratic colleagues in Congress or the administration that, that we, we outlined what we were for. And I think that's a responsible way to do our job as the minority party. Remember, David, you've got President Obama in the White House.  You've got large majorities of Democrats in the House and Senate.  They can't blame us for their problems.  And the, and the, the fact is, it's their problems. They've got a number of members who are saying no to what the liberals in Congress and the White House want to do.  It's, it's, they've got these big majorities.  They can't blame us for their inability to govern."
102,"MR. GREGORY:  Finally, I want to ask you about ""don't ask, don't tell."" The president said that he wants this to be reversed, that prohibition against gays in the military.  You have said, ""I think that `don't ask, don't tell' has worked very well, and we just ought to leave it alone."" Will this be a Republican campaign issue?"
103,"REP. BOEHNER:  I don't think it will be a campaign issue.  But in the middle of two wars, and, and in the middle of this giant security threat, why would we want to get into this debate?  While, at a time when Americans are asking, ""Where are the jobs?"" why do we want to get in this debate?  While we're fighting over health care and trying to find some way to come to some common ground, why do we want to get into a divisive debate that will do nothing more than distract the, the real debate that should occur here about helping get our economy going again and getting the American people back to work."
104,"MR. GREGORY:  Leader Boehner, we'll leave it there.  Always nice to have you on the program."
105,REP. BOEHNER:  Thank you.
106,MR. GREGORY:  Thanks very much.
107,"And coming up next, we'll break down the president's new agenda and his political standing.  A final word on the week ahead, a week that was and a look ahead--David Brooks, David Faber, Eugene Robinson and Mort Zuckerman. Plus, our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE, a look back at a time when Democrats and Republicans enjoyed open policy dialogues.  Right here on MEET THE PRESS."
108,(Announcements)
109,MR. GREGORY:  Our roundtable on a busy political week coming up right after this brief commercial break.
110,(Announcements)
111,"MR. GREGORY:  And we're back, joined now by CNBC's David Faber, Mort Zuckerman of U.S. News & World Report, David Brooks of The New York Times, and Gene Robinson of The Washington Post."
112,Welcome to all of you.
113,"Well, David Brooks, the final word at the end of the week, it was crystallized, I think, by The New Yorker cartoon which, I can tell you on good authority, the president finds quite amusing.  Here it is, these various panes describing how the president used to be able to walk on water, and that final page he actually shows he's a mere mortal, he's lost his magic power, he's into the drink.  Where are we?"
114,"MR. DAVID BROOKS:  Yeah.  Well, he's still got it, he's still carried in by cherubs when he goes to these meetings, he's still fantastic.  Listen, he's--what's happened is we've got two huge problems the government is not going to solve.  One is short-term, which is the economy, the jobs are just terrible.  I think they're probably going to be terrible for a while.  There's nothing the government's going to do to solve that over the next year.  The longer term is the fiscal situation, which is suicidal.  And the Republicans are not going to be willing to raise taxes, the Democrats are not going to be willing to cut spending, and so that looks almost unsolvable, too.  And so when the government is screwing up on the two major things, then the country gets really angry.  And the country is way ahead of Washington right now in its anger and its rage, and we're all struggling to catch up."
115,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Mort, if, if you listen to these two here this morning, Axelrod and Boehner, there isn't a lot of common cause.  There's potential for some agreements, but there's still this fundamental tension about whether the Republicans are obstructionists or not."
116,"MR. MORT ZUCKERMAN:  Well, I agree, there isn't that agreement; and there isn't that agreement on a program to at least deal with the short-term problem, which is getting people back to work.  I just don't think we have anything near that kind of a program that might have, in a sense, have gotten both the Republicans and Democrats together.  That seems to me the issue that is absolutely overwhelming the American public, and until they get some sense of progress on that, it's going to be a plague on both your houses, and the president's popularity has dropped because he is a symbol of the Democratic Party in this first year more than in any other period--short a period.  He's gone down by about 30 points in approval rating, and it's really primarily because of the economy."
117,"MR. GREGORY:  And it's interesting, Gene, here was the president, he took a little time out, a little break, going with some of his aides and the vice president to the ballgame yesterday, here at Verizon Center, Georgetown and Duke.  Georgetown overpowering Duke, I should point out.  And the, the president enjoying himself.  He even did a little commentary on the sidelines where was it basketball or politics they were talking about?  Listen."
118,"(Videotape, January 30, 2010)"
119,MR. VERNE LUNDQUIST:  You're obviously a left-hander.
120,PRES. OBAMA:  Yeah.
121,MR. LUNDQUIST:  Do you have any problems at all going to your right?
122,"PRES. OBAMA:  You know, I went to the Republican House Caucus just yesterday to prove that I could go to my right once in a while."
123,MR. LUNDQUIST:  Thank you.
124,PRES. OBAMA:  But there's no doubt that I've got a stronger left hand.
125,(End videotape)
126,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  See, a Republican, Gene, will say ""Exactly!  You've got a great left hand."" And he had to go to this Republican retreat and say, ""Hey, I'm not an ideologue."" And yet you heard me ask David Axelrod, ""Is it his view that he needs to move to the center?"" No, that's not what you took away from the State of the Union.  Did you?"
127,"MR. EUGENE ROBINSON:  No, I didn't.  And, and look, at the White House, they believe they've moved to the center, they believe that they have--that, in their policies, beginning with the stimulus bill, which was one-third tax cuts, and throughout their policies that they've tried to accommodate centrist and, and even conservative views, or certainly Republican views, and that they've gotten, you know, slapped--they've, they've gotten the back of the Republicans Party--Party's hand for their effort, that's what they believe. They--at the White House, they were thrilled with the, with the, the, the, the Baltimore..."
128,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
129,"MR. ROBINSON:  ...showdown question time and, and thought the president did really well and were very happy that he had had the opportunity to, to face his opponents in that forum, in a, in a, in a forum in which he does well. So, you know, I think they're, they're, they're very happy coming out of the week, State of the Union and the, and the Baltimore...(unintelligible)."
130,"MR. GREGORY:  David Faber, as you look at the week, has anything changed?"
131,"MR. DAVID FABER:  Well, it, it appears in some ways that the president is making it clear to the American people he is solely focused to the extent on the economy.  Obviously health care continues to be an important issue.  But that's where he's focused, that's where he meant--focused his State of the Union, clearly, on trying to create jobs.  He didn't go after the banks in a way that he had previously, even the week prior, in the State of the Union. And, and so perhaps the tone is changing just a bit, but that's where he's focused, of course, as David alluded, the challenges are, are significant.  We had a good GDP number in the, in the fourth quarter.  Mr. Axelrod mentioned it.  It was up 5.7 percent, not quite 6 percent, but nonetheless strong. However, a lot of questions remain about the economy, about the ability to deliver jobs, and about the consumer."
132,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, here's how--to that point, Larry Summers was over in Davos at the economic gathering, and this is what was reported on The Wall Street Journal:  Economic ""adviser Summers coined a telling way to look at the current American economic state of play.  He said the U.S. is experiencing a `statistical recovery and a human recession.'"" That's the issue."
133,"MR. ZUCKERMAN:  That recovery, 3.7 percent of the 5.7 percent, was for a reduction in the rate of inventory liquidation.  This is not exactly a formula for economic success.  I don't think that the major area that the country is focused on, which is the jobs part, has really been addressed yet.  And I didn't think--frankly, I had a real problem with his State of the Union message, not because I didn't think it was a good speech, but because, again, he was boiling the ocean, he was focusing on too many things, and I think he has to have much more comprehensive programs to deal with the economy.  That did not come out of it."
134,"MR. GREGORY:  Mort, you were at the White House this week, at the president's invitation, with other business leaders.  Give us some sense of that."
135,"MR. ZUCKERMAN:  Well, it's a little difficult for me to do that since it was supposed to be off the record."
136,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
137,"MR. ZUCKERMAN:  But I'll give you a general sense without--I'll cross my legs for a second, OK?"
138,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
139,"MR. ZUCKERMAN:  Look, I think it all focused on the economy.  And again, a, a good part of it focused on what I just said, in fact, I focused on that, because I do think that he's got to really concentrate his political capital and the country's attention and the Congress' attention on a whole series of programs to improve the economy and the jobs.  We can't do much, as David says, about the fiscal thing at this point, but the country is really terrified.  It's--the overall unemployment rate, if you take full- and part-time unemployment, is somewhere in the range of 20 percent.  We've never seen that in our lifetime."
140,"MR. FABER:  But we do know, I mean, jobs lag a recovery, and certainly that will be the case here.  It is always the case."
141,MR. ZUCKERMAN:  Without question.  But we're in a very different kind of economic recession now because it was induced by a financial crisis.  And that is something we have not experienced in this country anywhere near to this degree.  It's going to take a much longer time.  We've got to have government programs.  It's the only agent...
142,MR. FABER:  Yeah.  We've lost 7.2 million jobs...
143,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
144,MR. FABER:  ...since the recession began.  It's going to be tough.
145,"MR. ROBINSON:  Who's got political capital to spend, at this point, except for Scott Brown, in, in Massachusetts, perhaps?  You know, if, if you look at the--personal popularity, the president is actually, personally, quite popular."
146,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
147,"MR. ROBINSON:  And that graphic you showed earlier, 27 percent are, are blaming him essentially for everything being messed up, 48 percent blaming the, the congressional Republicans and 41 percent the congressional Democrats. It's, it's unclear who is the--I guess the president's in a better position than anybody else.  But how are you going to get a second stimulus?  What are you going to do about jobs and, and the economy?"
148,"MR. BROOKS:  Yeah, to me, that's the profundity of what Larry Summers has said about the human recession, because it's a psychological recession.  If you ask people, ""Why aren't you investing?  Why aren't you lending?"" it all comes down to uncertainty, at the end of the day.  And so we could shove money into the economy, but if bankers and entrepreneurs don't have any sense of certainty, then they're just not going to invest for something six months out, a year out.  And so we've not only got this economic problem, but it's compounded by a psychological problem, magnified by the fact that distrust of institutions is at a highest level in American history.  You go back to Watergate, you could go back to everything, people distrust institutions more than ever before."
149,"MR. GREGORY:  You know, to that point, from our Wall Street Journal poll, look at this in terms of the view of the federal government and the fact that most people believe that it's not working well, that it's unhealthy.  Seventy percent feel that way."
150,"And, David Faber, it gets to the point--the president wants a focus on jobs, rhetorically for sure, but ultimately government has to deliver.  The stimulus has not lived up to its promise by the, the own admission of the, of the administration in terms of that initial impact on the unemployment rate.  How much can government do at this point to create jobs?"
151,"MR. BROOKS:  It--that's a very good question.  I mean, $800 billion in stimulus, of course a lot of it has yet to be spent."
152,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
153,"MR. FABER:  And so we're still going to see some of the effect from that. But, certainly, the government can only help.  It can't actually deal with the problem directly and create jobs all over the place, other than with direct spending to have people making roads and things like that.  Businesses need to hire--small businesses, medium-size businesses.  Those are challenged right now because they can't get loans from banks to help them expand.  And big business needs to hire.  We're not seeing any of that.  It doesn't mean we won't.  Typically, you need to get some confidence back before you'll see CEOs say, ""OK, I feel like I can actually start to hire now."" It hasn't happened as yet."
154,"MR. ZUCKERMAN:  Look, we are also looking at a condition where the state and local governments and local school boards are going to be cutting their expenses by $200 billion this year.  It's completely countercyclical.  It's going to wipe out much of what we still think is left of the stimulus program. They've got to come up with a much more serious program.  I, I, I mean, there's a major industrial program, industrial policy that is possible to improve manufacturing in this country.  They've got to have a whole series of these programs because we may have a double dip in this recession, and then we're going to be in real, real trouble."
155,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let me bring up health care as well, and, and you heard David Axelrod say the president does not think it's dead, that it can't be dead.  Even though it's not going to be a priority, they're going to let it linger, which has been dangerous.  There's a reason why the president set deadlines and said it has to be done this year.  Going back to Clinton's experience and the failure of healthcare reform, Joe Klein wrote an interesting column on this.  And this is part of what he said:  ""The other mistake that [President Clinton made on Health Care reform] was political:  a dozen years after Ronald Reagan was elected president, the public still believed, as Reagan said in his Inaugural, that `government is the problem,' not the solution to the country's difficulties.  Clinton realized, too late, that he should have focused on governing effectively first."""
156,"Gene, could the same be said now for this effort at health care?"
157,"MR. ROBINSON:  Well, I think, in retrospect, yeah, you could.  I mean, the--as you know, the White House made the calculation that, you know, coming in on a wave of popularity, first year, somewhat inconvenient about the economy falling apart, but, but that this was their big opportunity to do health care before we got into an election year cycle, before things got really complicated.  Well, things got really complicated from the beginning. They got more complicated as, as time went on.  And, and so, you know, from today you can look back and say, yeah, sure, they probably would have had more success if they had had a, had a, had established a record of governing, if they had focused on the economy.  I think it was hard to--hard for them to see that then."
158,"MR. BROOKS:  Some people were saying it, though, at the time."
159,MR. ZUCKERMAN:  Right.
160,MR. FABER:  Yeah.
161,"MR. BROOKS:  Many people were saying it at, at the time, including a guy named Bill Galston at the Brookings Institution, who was Bill Clinton's domestic policy adviser.  He--they came in, and he was writing--listen, when FDR came in, people--70 percent of the people had trust in government to do the right thing most of the time.  Now it's 17 percent.  You can't presume they're going to trust you to take everything into Washington.  So you got to build slowly. And a lot of people were arguing against the big bang that Obama went for on precisely those grounds, and it's come back to bite them."
162,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
163,"MR. ZUCKERMAN:  And I might say, when they did that in the Congress, they were not too responsive to the Republican Party.  Now the Republican Party's sitting there stone-faced when the president delivers his State of the Union message.  But, for that first year, the Democrats, shall we say, were on a high.  They were not exactly accommodating to the Republicans.  But I agree with David, that had to be the focus.  A lot of people were saying this is much more serious because it was so different as a financial crisis-induced recession.  That's what required the focus.  We still aren't getting it."
164,"MR. FABER:  Yeah, it was January '09.  I mean, it wasn't like we're talking 2007 when we didn't know if we were going to have a recession.  We were already in the midst of a very serious recession..."
165,MR. ZUCKERMAN:  Right.
166,"MR. FABER:  ...when the president took over.  So there were plenty of people who, I think, were aware of it."
167,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Gene, is, is that fair that, you know, that the president has acknowledged the, the unified opposition of the Republicans, which has been a tactical, strategic choice that's been made.  How much room were they giving him?"
168,"MR. ROBINSON:  Well, you know, when you get to the point where, where Republican members of Congress are opposing bills that--you know, measures that they co-sponsored, which, which we have seen in recent days, clearly there, there is tactic--there are tactics and strategy involved here.  And, and now you're hearing Republicans, as, as Congressman Boehner brought out the book to, to lay on the table and present, kind of, kind of feeling that, that I think the administration has had some impact in saying ""party of no, party of no, party of no"" whenever anyone says ""Republican."" And, and I think that's, that is beginning to smart a bit."
169,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk about the, the political landscape overall.  Here's the cover of The Weekly Standard, which is--asks a provocative question at a time when there are potential gains by the GOP.  It's, ""Can Republicans Govern?"""
170,"David Brooks, you wrote this week about the potential for a third party re-emerging, which you call the ""sane Ross Perot."" You see--whether it's the tea party movement.  But so much--people look at Washington and say, ""It's broken.  They're just not getting things done here."""
171,MR. ROBINSON:  Right.
172,MR. BROOKS:  Yeah.  The only thing I'd caution Republicans about is distrust of government is not anti-government.
173,MR. GREGORY:  Hm.
174,"MR. BROOKS:  People want government to work, they just don't believe in it. So I think Republicans are doing what Democrats have, have done and what Republicans have done before, which is overreading the ideological mandate. They think the people are--distrust government, therefore they want big slashing.  They can get away with just saying, ""We want big tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts."""
175,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
176,"MR. BROOKS:  We can go back to that old song, ""That's not true."""
177,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, Newt Gingrich has said--calling for a new Contract With America, that the GOP needs to be an alternative party, not an opposition party."
178,"MR. ZUCKERMAN:  They, they do have--the Republicans have an advantage, though.  The Democrats are in power.  They--the referendum is going to be on the Democrats in the November elections, not on the Republicans.  So if the Republicans distract the country from that and become the ""party of no,"" they'll suffer for it.  They've got to be constructive much more than they have been today."
179,"MR. GREGORY:  David Faber, so much of the administration will tell you privately and, and publicly that if the economy doesn't make any gains here, if unemployment is not dented, it's going to be really hard for Democrats in the fall.  It's going to go on to be hard for the president in, in 2012. Based on the people that you're talking to, what is that impetus to start hiring again?  Where is it?  When is it going to come?"
180,"MR. FABER:  Well, in some cases it may come fairly soon.  But it's a fair question and a very important one.  If you're a CEO of a, let's call it a fairly large company, right now you've actually been profiting fairly well. You've cut your costs a lot by firing people, in part.  But you may start to at least feel somewhat confident.  You're watching your stock price, it's probably doing OK.  That may lead you to think, ""OK, I've got to start reinvesting in the business to a certain extent."" We might start to see that. Small businesses, medium-sized businesses, I think it's a larger question. The banks got us into this problem in part by making very poor lending decisions.  Now they don't want to do that again, and they are much more stringent.  They are not lending.  Very hard to get access to capital.  That's what you need if you're going to go out and create jobs.  So it's that confidence and capital.  It's not clear that we have all of that."
181,"MR. ROBINSON:  So much of the economy and our economic growth has been driven by consumer spending.  And consumers don't want to spend.  Consumers feel poorer than they felt a few years ago.  Their houses are worth less.  They feel their jobs are, are, are more precarious.  And so how do, how do you solve that?  How do you get people..."
182,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
183,"MR. FABER:  In the fourth quarter they did spend a little bit more, we should point out, than they had the year previously."
184,"MR. GREGORY:  I, I've just got about a minute left.  I want to--David, I want you to engage on this topic.  You heard David Axelrod say about this transfer of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to New York for trial is now in a, in a state of abeyance, which is there is no decision, but obviously they're now leaning against a decision that they had made very strongly.  This is significant."
185,"MR. BROOKS:  Yes.  Eric Holder did not consult the president before he made that decision, the attorney general.  And that was a huge mistake, because it's a political decision and it's a national security decision.  And they just made a tremendous error, and they're going to walk it back."
186,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet they're saying, Gene, there's, there's still no decision yet.  I mean, what--why are--what's the final shoe?"
187,"MR. ROBINSON:  Still no decision, but it sounds like there's a decision, doesn't there?"
188,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.  Yeah.
189,"MR. ROBINSON:  I mean, would you--no, if Mayor Bloomberg is saying, you know, ""Thanks, but no thanks,"" I, I don't, I don't think over that objection you can, you can go ahead with that."
190,MR. GREGORY:  But...
191,"MR. ROBINSON:  It, it is very interesting, though.  It, it, it does speak to a, to a certain independence of the attorney general, and I..."
192,MR. GREGORY:  But what are the consequences politically on this at a time when the Republicans are mounting a new charge of being soft on terror?
193,"MR. ROBINSON:  Well, they, they walk it back, and they say, ""Why, we're tough on terror."""
194,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.  Yeah.
195,"MR. ROBINSON:  ""We're""--you know.  And..."
196,MR. BROOKS:  It was a huge issue for Scott Brown.  He used that issue...
197,"MR. ZUCKERMAN:  Scott Brown, right.  Scott Brown said, you know, ""Let's spend the money on our defense systems and our anti-terrorist systems, not on providing lawyers for terrorists."" I mean, that is a very easy political hit for him to make, and it--the, the Democrats are vulnerable on that issue."
198,"MR. FABER:  The city of Newark also saying, ""Hey, it's going to cost us a lot of money.  We don't want to spend that money."""
199,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
200,"MR. FABER:  That's going to be a huge issue this year.  State, local government, huge deficits, David.  Perhaps higher taxes on the state level, again, taxing the consumer."
201,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we're going to leave it there.  Thanks to all of you very much.  Great conversation."
202,"Coming next, our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE.  A look back at the not-so-distant past, when leaders of both parties sat side-by-side debating policy and politics right here on MEET THE PRESS, right after this brief station break."

GREGORY:  And we're back with our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE.  Lots of talk this week of how broken Washington is and a desire to bring back a sense of bipartisanship.  Well, here's an attempt right here on MEET THE PRESS by the Senate majority leader and Senate minority leader back in 1989 to find some early areas of agreement in what would later become a major political battle over the fiscal 1991 budget."
205,"(Videotape, October 29, 1989)"
206,"MR. GARRICK UTLEY:  You don't see any possibility of an agreement as we start to work on the fiscal 1991 budget, which is going to be a tremendous challenge, a tremendous problem that might involve some kind of revenue increase in exchange for cuts in spending?"
207,"SEN. BOB DOLE (R-KS):  Well, I would say this, and I think maybe we'd find agreement if, if everything's on the table."
208,MR. UTLEY:  Mm-hmm.
209,"SEN. DOLE:  I mean everything, entitlements as well as the revenues, then you've got some reason for agreement because I think, as Senator Mitchell has pointed out, we blame Democrats for tax increases, they blame us for reducing Social Security.  So you've got to get it all on the table so there isn't any political backfire."
210,MR. UTLEY:  OK.  Senator Mitchell...
211,SEN. GEORGE MITCHELL (D-ME):  Yeah.
212,MR. UTLEY:  ...you'll put it all on the table?
213,"SEN. MITCHELL:  Oh, yes.  I think if Senator Dole and I could settle this matter, that is if we were the only participants and say a group in the Senate, I think we could have an agreement in a very short order.  I think that..."
214,"MR. UTLEY:  Well, let's settle up right now.  I mean, would you agree to put some entitlement cuts on the table in principle?"
215,SEN. DOLE:  Not cuts.
216,SEN. MITCHELL:  Not cuts.
217,MR. UTLEY:  Not cuts.  But I mean...
218,"SEN. MITCHELL:  No, I, yeah, I think everything should be on the table.  I think the problem we have now, the preconditions before discussions by one side that require the other side to establish preconditions and pretty soon the discussion..."
219,"MR. UTLEY:  And, and you would raise..."
220,SEN. MITCHELL:  ...everything is off the table and there's nothing left to discuss.  ...
221,SEN. DOLE:  That's billions of dollars.
222,"MS. ANDREA MITCHELL:  But it's the White House that has really blocked this kind of compromise, isn't it?"
223,SEN. MITCHELL:  That's exactly right.
224,MR. UTLEY:  Do you agree with that?
225,"SEN. DOLE:  Well, I don't know.  I, I don't believe so.  I don't think we've ever had everything on the table.  You know, we came very close in Reagan's administration on two occasions.  I think next year might be an opportunity for all of us, and I'm talking about the president, too."
226,(End videotape)
227,"MR. GREGORY:  Months later, as budget talks stalled, President Bush did put tax increases on the table and famously broke with his ""no new taxes"" vow, saying any deficit-cutting agreement would require tax increases.  By the way, the last time the majority leader and minority leader of the Senate appeared here together was eight years ago, months after the 9/11 attacks."
228,"If there is, indeed, a new era of constructive engagement, we want Leaders Reid and McConnell to know of an open invitation to appear together and talk constructively right here, any Sunday, on MEET THE PRESS."

6,PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  It's a choice between falling backwards or moving forward.

8,"MR. GREGORY:  Our political roundtable weighs in:  MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, just back from an up-close reporting tour in Afghanistan; New York Times columnist David Brooks; former Democratic Congressman Harold Ford, author of the upcoming political memoir ""More Davids Than Goliaths""; and Ed Gillespie, former White House counselor and chairman of the Republican
Party."

10,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
11,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
12,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Another attempt this weekend by BP to contain the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  The cap catching some of the oil was removed in an effort to replace it with an improved version to try to capture all of the oil.  In the meantime, you can see, the oil is now
flowing once again freely into the gulf. "
13,"Joining us this morning for an exclusive interview, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs."
14,"Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS, Robert."
15,MR. ROBERT GIBBS:  Good morning.
16,MR. GREGORY:  Good to have you.
17,MR. GIBBS:  How are you?
18,MR. GREGORY:  This developing story is one that you're obviously tracking very closely.  The president said to the country that by the end of June we'd see containment of the oil.  What's happening now... 
19,MR. GIBBS:  Right.
20,"MR. GREGORY:  ...and what level of concern does it give you, or optimism does it give you?"
21,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, we're at a very critical point in the containment efforts. The sealing cap will double our capacity.  There's another procedure called the Helix that could take 25,000 barrels a day out. That should be online we hope later today.  Obviously, the timeline got pushed backwards because of hurricane and tropical weather in the gulf that made things more difficult. But understand that we were pulling about 25,000 barrels per oil--25,000 barrels of oil a day in a containment procedure.  When all of this is online--the sealing cap, the
Helix, the Q4000, which is burning oil even as we speak, so some oil is being contained--we'll have a containment procedure that will be between 60 and 80,000 barrels of oil a day.  The sealing cap will also help in the next step, and that will be getting the relief well finished, shoving the mud and the cement down both the relief well and through the blowout preventer and sealing that well once and for all."
22,"MR. GREGORY:  You're confident, the president's confident in how BP's handling this phase of the operation? "
23,"MR. GIBBS:  Thad Allen and our federal on-scene coordinator approved BP going ahead with the procedures that they're working on now.  Those pictures--again, that--the top hat that has been on there for several weeks that collected 700,000 barrels of oil is off.  But the new
containment procedure will more than triple our capacity when it's all said and done."
24,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me talk about politics, and the president's campaigning. In effect, it's the October in July in some ways, the president on the campaign trail this week.  And he, he attempted to frame the debate for the fall.  He was in Kansas City, Missouri, on Thursday,
and this is what he said."
25,"(Videotape, Thursday)"
26,"PRES. OBAMA:  You're going to face a choice in November, and I want everybody to be very clear about what the--that choice is.  This is a choice between the policies that got us into this mess in the first place and the policies that are getting us out of this mess."
27,(End videotape)
28,"MR. GREGORY:  The policies getting us out of this mess is the claim. Those are the president's policies.  It's what Democrats would be running on.  And yet this is where the public is.  The president's approval rating is upside down, according to our most recent poll, approving, 45
percent; disapproving, 48 percent.  And a sense of whether the country's on the right track, look at this, pretty sour mood out there:  62 percent in our poll saying it's off on the wrong track.  So, contrary to what the president is saying, the public seems to be in a different place."
29,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, David, I don't think it's surprising that the American people are frustrated after having lost eight and a half million jobs. But that's exactly the argument that he's making.  Understand, the last six months of 2008, right, we saw an economy that shed three million jobs.  The first six months of 2010, this economy has created 600,000 private sector jobs.  The, the point the president was making and the point that the president will make this fall is, do you want to go backward to an economy that led us into this mess, that saw the greatest financial calamity since the Great Depression, that turned record surpluses into record deficits?  Or do you want to continue on the track that the president has put us on, that has started to create private sector jobs."
30,"The president will travel this week to Holland, Michigan.  Michigan, everybody in this country knows, is, is, is home to auto manufacturing in a big way. But what the president's going to go visit is the ninth of nine advanced battery manufacturing plants--this will be a ground
breaking--that will create jobs, that will supply advanced batteries for the Chevy Volt, an electric car that Chevy's going to manufacture and will get a hundred miles on a single charge.  This is the ninth of nine that's are--as a result of that recovery act plan.  Just in 2010, we
produced 2 percent of the world's advanced batteries.  In other words, to produce something like the Chevy Volt, we were going to have to bring batteries in from overseas.  As a result of this Recovery Act investment that is met with private capital, in just five years, by 2015, we'll
manufacture 40 percent of the world's batteries.  That creates the jobs of tomorrow.  So we have a choice.  Are we going to go back to the movie that we've already seen and we know the results, or are we going to look forward?"
31,"MR. GREGORY:  You're talking about a future market for an energy independent market, which is certainly very important.  There's a lot of agreement about that.  But the president's talking about his particular record that he wants to run on.  And there are some facts.  We know that
private sector hiring has been extremely flat.  We know that the mortgage market is still a mess.  After that first time tax credit was expired, first-time home sales plummeted by a third.  And we know that there's a sense that even the stimulus is not producing the jobs that it was
promised to; 9.5 percent unemployment now.  The original reporting was we'd keep unemployment with the stimulus at 8 percent."
32,"And here's Politico just this morning, Jonathan Martin writing about some of the feeling among Democrats, let me put it up on the screen.  ""While almost uniformly grateful for the financial windfall they enjoyed from the stimulus legislation, the Democrats,"" some Democrats, ""believe it
wasn't sold well to the public and more still has to be done to revive the lagging economy.  `I think the bottom line is they're not seeing the jobs that should have come with it,' said West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin,"" now running for Senate, ""explaining why voters in his state
were dissatisfied with the massive spending bill.  `Are we just protecting government or are we really stimulating the economy?'"""
33,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, let's take a look at it.  Again, the quarter before--the, the two quarters of economic growth that we had before the president came to office, our economy was contracting by 6 percent.  Now we're growing by 3 percent.  David, I'm not here to unfurl the ""mission accomplished"" banner, OK? We've got a lot of work to do, and the president understands that, and we're working every day to increase small business lending, to make sure that we don't lay off teachers and firefighters that we know are essential in what we do every day.  But the president's going to lay out a choice:  Look back to where we came from
and look back to where--and look forward to where we're going.  And I think if by any definition of that, of that, you will see that we know what happened.  We know the policies that led us into a financial calamity, massive budget deficits, not paying for programs that this
government wanted to start, and a future-oriented growth agenda that this president instituted.  We've definitely had to make tough choices. "
34,"Like I said, it's understandable that people are frustrated given where we are in unemployment.  We lost eight and a half million jobs. There--it's going to take some time to fix.  But, David, we think if you look at where we were and where we are--you say that employment is flat. We've created 600,000 private sector jobs in the first six months.  We
were losing 700- to 800,000 jobs a month just a short time ago.  So there's no doubt that things are getting better.  The economic recovery is no doubt fragile.  The president and his team will continue to strengthen that.  And we've got a long, long way to go. But we think if
you take a look backwards and look forwards, there's no doubt that we're on the right path."
35,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but how much of what happened over the previous eight years is something that's still legitimate to consider?  When do you really have to own what you've tried and what you've accomplished?"
36,"MR. GIBBS:  Oh, there's no doubt we, we, we have the responsibility for fixing the mess, right?  But as the president said, don't drive the car into the ditch, right?  Don't drive the car into the ditch and then now want the keys back, because we know how you drive, right?  We understand what got us there, OK?  The president has had to make a lot of tough
decisions.  The car's out of the ditch, the car's back on the road.  The question is, are you going to give the keys back to the Republicans and let them drive it back into the ditch again?"
37,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet you have Democrats attempting, it seems, to localize a lot of these races.  They're a little worried about running with the president in a midterm race.  The Wash--excuse me, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday a little bit about that localizing
strategy.  I'm going to put it up on the screen.  ""The effort [to shift voters' attention away from Washington] is designed to prevent Republicans from turning the fall elections into a national referendum on President Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress, whose popularity
among swing voters has  been in sharp decline over the last year. Instead, Democrats are trying to turn each race into a unique, one-on-one matchup between local candidates."" And yet, here is a president who achieved health care reform, who's on the brink of achieving financial regulation.  Do you think it's an unwise strategy for Democrats to try to separate themselves from the president, from Democratic leaders in Washington?"
38,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, look, let's take financial recovery as something where, again, we can look backward and we can look forward.  John Boehner, who would be the speaker of the House if the Republicans were to take the House back over, last week equated the wreckage that was left as a result of the financial calamity to an ant, OK?  The president has made some
tough decisions that we have a financial reform bill, a Wall Street reform bill, that's--puts in place the strongest rules that we've had since the Great Depression, and almost uniformly you've got Republicans in the House that have said no.  I think that is a great issue both at a
national and a local level for people to go to their constituents and go to their voters and say, ""Do you think that the rules that we had in place in September of 2008 that caused this financial calamity, we should have those rules in place?  Or should we put new tough rules of the road so the banks can't cause that again?"""
39,"MR. GREGORY:  But you're making--you're sort of making the case--you're making the case, but, but the issue at hand is you have a lot of Democrats who are saying, ""Let me try to keep my distance from the national party and from the president."" Is that unwise?"
40,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, no, look, a man far smarter than me said, ""All politics is local."" And having worked on a number of races, I think that's the truth.  But there's no doubt that there are obviously larger national issues, financial recovery being, certainly, one of them, whether it is
the investments that had to be made short-term that are creating jobs and had this economy moving in the right direction, positive growth for the first time, adding jobs in this economy vs. looking backward; or are we going to have a financial reform that puts--that solidifies for Wall
Street the rules that we had that caused this mess, or are we going to put rules in place that finally, finally, once and for all, put Main Street in the driver's seat, not at the whims of Wall Street?"
41,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you a broader question that I posed in the open, and I think you should have an opportunity to respond to, which is, on a lot of the issues that you face right now from the oil spill to the economy, to the war in Afghanistan, is the president and his team falling short, or are we in a situation where expectations were set too high?"
42,"MR. GIBBS:  That's a good question.  Look, I think on either, either one of these things, the time frame on--look, the time frame on the war in Afghanistan, we've been in Afghanistan for almost 10 years.  The president has obviously added a number of new troops, both at the
beginning of 2009 and certainly last winter, and those troops are coming in.  But this is always going to take some time.  We knew it was going to take some time.  Sometimes the time for Afghanistan or the time for financial recovery may not perfectly line up with the 2010 elections, and we understand that people are frustrated. Everybody's frustrated.  Look,
the president is frustrated that we haven't seen greater recovery efforts.  But that doesn't stop us from doing what we know is right, instituting the policies that we know will bring this country back and put it on a pathway forward that lets our economy grow or creates
stronger security for our country."
43,"MR. GREGORY:  A few, a few quick ones on the economy.  Will you let the Bush tax cuts expire, in effect creating a tax hike on Americans? "
44,"MR. GIBBS:  The president is not going to, at a time of economic crisis, raise taxes on the middle class."
45,MR. GREGORY:  So he will not let them expire for the middle class...
46,MR. GIBBS:  For the middle class.
47,MR. GREGORY:  ...but for wealthier Americans.
48,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, for, for, for those that weren't asking for them when they got them and didn't necessarily either need or deserve them, they're not going to have their tax cuts extended."
49,MR. GREGORY:  So should--will Congress take this up before the fall elections?  Because they'd been suggesting that they would put it off. 
50,"MR. GIBBS:  Look, I don't know what Congress' schedule is.  I know what the president has in mind, and that is for middle class Americans who have borne the brunt of this economic calamity, we're certainly not going to raise taxes on them."
51,MR. GREGORY:  What about the capital gains tax?  Will the president like to see it stay at 20 percent?
52,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, again, I think that's going to be part of the discussion that we have to have to make sure that in a fragile economic time we don't, we don't choke off any recovery."
53,"MR. GREGORY:  The, the housing mess is still a mess."
54,MR. GIBBS:  Right.
55,"MR. GREGORY:  The mortgage market is still in a lot of trouble.  And, as I mentioned, first-time home buyer sales fell off a third after the government stopped propping it up with the, the first-time--the tax credit.  Mortgage modification, a plan highly touted by this administration... "
56,MR. GIBBS:  Right.
57,"MR. GREGORY:  ...proved unsuccessful.  And the, the two largest former private companies and now quasi-government agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they guarantee 90 percent of the mortgages in this country. "
58,MR. GIBBS:  Right.
59,"MR. GREGORY:  They have yet to be reformed; and yet, the--one of the president's top economic advisers, Larry Summers, is one of the most vociferous critics of those two companies."
60,MR. GIBBS:  Right.
61,MR. GREGORY:  So where is the plan here to deal with what is still the heart of the financial crisis?
62,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, let's understand that the mortgage modification program that you talked about has helped hundreds of thousands.  Understand in a, in a hard economy it is, it is difficult in, in any sense to create a program that helps somebody stay in their house if they're losing their job, right?  So we're working on both keeping people in their houses, again, those that should be in their houses.  There are, no doubt, David, people that got loans over the course of this economic boom that ended in bust that, quite frankly, shouldn't have gotten loans, right?  Those are not the people that the president wants to protect.  But those that are making their mortgage payments, that's what the president is working on.
When it relates to Fannie and Freddie, you hear this a lot from Republicans in Congress, there's no doubt that this is something that has to be reformed.  The secretary of the Treasury and our economic team are working on that.  That will be the next step in financial reform once we
get the legislation through Congress."
63,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
64,"MR. GIBBS:  But getting that legislation through Congress is a massively important step in that financial recovery, and you hear Republicans in Congress saying, ""Well I can't be for that because it doesn't include Fannie and Freddie."" Well, we're going to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  As you said, we have a very volatile housing market and we have to
do that in the right way; but that's not an excuse to leave in place the rules that brought us this financial calamity.  And I think... "
65,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
66,MR. GIBBS:  ...we're--Democrat and Republican candidates will be able to have a great debate about that in the fall.
67,"MR. GREGORY:  But can you say that the president's focused like, like a laser beam on the economy if he hasn't really zeroed in on the housing problems? With, with the kind of--and you have, you have agencies that take on, guarantee 90 percent of the mortgage debt and you're still not reforming them."
68,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, again, there's a process that's under way, David, to do that.  But understand, in a fragile economy and, certainly, as you mentioned, a fragile housing market, we can't do everything at the same time.  We put in place a financial recovery plan that is growing the economy and is adding jobs.  We're on the verge of passing financial reform, which will put new rules in place, and the next step of that will be reforming Fannie and Freddie."
69,"MR. GREGORY:  Big story this week was the Russian spies swap.  A lot of Americans saying, ""Wow, what a,"" you know, ""what a thrilling story out of a spy novel itself."" And it seemed like the priority here was U.S.-Russia relations.  But the question still outstanding is, what kind of threat does Russia pose with its espionage against the United States?"
70,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, let's step back for a second and understand that I think this is a great credit to our law enforcement.  We, we made arrests, the law enforcement community made arrests.  These individuals have been monitored for quite some time.  They tried, but they never got
classified information and intelligence, and now they've left the country, which, again, is a big win for our law enforcement community.  I set that aside.  I think our relationship with Russia is, is no doubt improving if you look at where it was just a few years ago.  The economic
discussions that President Medvedev and President Obama had just recently and the progress that we've made in reducing nuclear weapons--and hopefully we'll get a treaty through the Senate this summer that will further reduce nuclear weapons--means our security is stronger and safer and our relationship is stronger."
71,"MR. GREGORY:  More broadly on foreign policy, I can remember back two years ago, as you certainly can, July of 2008, the president giving a major foreign policy speech in Berlin.  Still a candidate and yet really well received. This was, in effect, an attempt to show the world a new face of foreign policy that would happen under President Barack Obama. And yet, as the president tried to do a 180 from Bush foreign policy, you find how difficult it is.  The promise to close down the prison at Guantanamo Bay, yet it's still open.  The Afghanistan war is not scaled down, it's been escalated.  This administration has upheld the state secrets exemption in its pursuit of terrorists legally. It appears the worst-kept secret in Washington is that there appears to be abandoned plans to put Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in front of a civilian trial. Same
strategy for North Korea and Iran basically."
72,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, hold on, let's..."
73,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
74,"MR. GIBBS:  I hate to interrupt, but let's understand this.  We have the toughest sanctions on North Korea that we've ever had as a result of unanimous U.N. Security Council resolution."
75,MR. GREGORY:  Same strategy.  Same strategy.
76,MR. GIBBS:  Same strategy...
77,MR. GREGORY:  Pursued by the Bush administration.
78,"MR. GIBBS:  More important, better tactics.  We've got the strongest sanctions regime on Iran that has ever been in place.  And, David, go back..."
79,MR. GREGORY:  Same strategy as the Bush administration.
80,"MR. GIBBS:  But, but understand--let's go back to the Bush administration."
81,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
82,MR. GIBBS:  You brought this up.  I know the next panel's going to say I blamed this all on the Bush administration...
83,"MR. GREGORY:  No, no, no.  But can I just finish?"
84,MR. GIBBS:  But--let me...
85,"MR. GREGORY:  The predicate here, which is, is it harder to do a reversal from Bush foreign policy than you originally thought?"
86,"MR. GIBBS:  No, because I think you've greatly oversimplified it.  It--if you ask Ed Gillespie, ask any of the folks that you had right now, if in September of 2008 or October of 2008 or November of 2008 whether China and Russia were going to come on board for strengthening sanctions against Iran.  The answer to that would be a flat no.  You wouldn't have gotten to the security council because you would have had at least two countries raise their hand to veto those.  This president has put together a coalition that includes Russia and China, that's actually strengthened our sanctions regime on South Korea***(as spoken).  We have
better relationships with virtually every country in the world as a result of the president's foreign policy outreach.  We're reducing nuclear weapons in this world that we know can cause the type of calamity, whether, whether they accidentally launch or whether they fell,
fell into the hands of a terrorist.  There's no doubt, David, that we have taken foreign policy in a different direction.  We have improved relationships with countries, but not just as a means to an ends.  That's actually making our country safer and more secure as a result.  I, I
think you created oversimplified sort of what the president is trying to do, because the things that he's instituted couldn't have been done in the last administration."
87,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But those are all accurate issues?  I mean, I didn't misstate any of that, did I?"
88,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, I think I--I think you and I had a little interchange there on North Korea and Iran because, again, whether you go through the same strategy is not necessarily what is at case here, and that is we have built--and the president has taken a different strategy with Iran, right?  He said to the world, ""I'm happy to discuss Iran with Iran if its--if it will come to the table and live up to its obligations."" That's what brought the Chinese and the Russians to the table at the United Nations.  That's what showed the world that it wasn't, it wasn't anything that had to do with American or our allied aggression toward Iran, it was that Iran was hiding a secret nuclear weapons program.  And if Iran is unwilling to, in front of the world, discuss that, as the president invited them to do, then it becomes clear for everybody in the world that this is an Iranian secret nuclear weapons program.  That's why everybody's at the table, and that's what we have the strongest sanctions regime on Iran that we've ever had."
89,"MR. GREGORY:  Two final points.  First of all, I want to get a prediction from you on, back on the political debate.  Is the House in jeopardy, the majority for the Democrats in the House, in jeopardy?"
90,"MR. GIBBS:  I think there's no doubt that there are a lot of seats that will be up, a lot of contested seats.  I think people are going to have a choice to make in the fall.  But I think there's no doubt there are enough seats in play that could cause Republicans to gain control.
There's no doubt about that. This will depend on strong campaigns by Democrats.  And again, I think we've got to take the issues to them.  You know, are--do you want to put in, in to the speakership of the House a guy who thinks that the, the financial calamity is, is tantamount to an ant?  The guy who's the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Joe Barton, started his congressional testimony of the CEO of BP by apologizing, not to the people in the gulf, but to the CEO.  I think that's a perfect window, not into what people are thinking, but the way they would govern.  Joe Barton, John Boehner, those are the type of things you'll hear a lot, I think, from both the president and local candidates about what you'd get if the Republicans were to gain control."
91,"MR. GREGORY:  Finally, perhaps an issue a little bit easier to pin you down on, and that would be another showdown, potentially, with LeBron James.  I don't know if you heard, but LeBron James is going to the Miami Heat.  He's leaving Cleveland."
92,MR. GIBBS:  I had not heard that.
93,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah, I know, a lot of people had missed that.  And when he spoke to ESPN on Thursday, this is what he said about the president's game, OK?  He said, ""I think President Obama would hold his own"" if they went one-on-one.  ""I've seen him shoot the ball - he's a lefty, too.  You know, pretty much all lefties can shoot."" Might we see a one-on-one
showdown at the White House, since, after all, James disappointed the president..."
94,"MR. GIBBS:  Yes, he did."
95,MR. GREGORY:  ...by not going to Chicago.
96,"MR. GIBBS:  Yeah.  He disappointed the people in Ohio, he disappointed the people in Chicago.  Look, I, I can only imagine if the president had an opportunity to play against LeBron James, he would take it.  I don't know that we would make the game public or the outcome of the score
public because, let's just say, somebody who's 6'8"", quite that size, starts with an advantage that is hard for the president to, to make up. "
97,"MR. GREGORY:  We can probably agree, as I think the world can agree, that we've spoken enough about LeBron James this week."
98,MR. GIBBS:  Amen.
99,"MR. GREGORY:  Robert Gibbs, thank you very much."
100,"MR. GIBBS:  Thank you, David."
101,MR. GREGORY:  Appreciate it.

104,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up, the debates over economic stimulus, energy, and national security.  Our roundtable weighs in on the key issues in races for the fall campaign after this brief commercial break."
105,(Announcements)
106,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We're back now.  Joining us, chairman of the Republican State Leadership Committee and former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Ed Gillespie; chair of the Democratic Leadership Council, former Congressman Harold Ford Jr.; the host of
MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show,"" Rachel herself; and New York Times columnist David Brooks."
107,"Welcome back.  So much to talk to, and I want to start with politics.  I spent a good deal of time on that with Robert Gibbs.  The president's out there, as I said, it's, it's, it's October in July here.  And he made the case, made the distinction between Republicans and Democrats and the choice that the voters' face.  This is him on Thursday."
108,"(Videotape, Thursday)"
109,"PRES. OBAMA:  They, they've got, you know, they've got that ""no"" philosophy, that ""you're on your own"" philosophy, the ""status quo"" philosophy, a philosophy that says, ""Everything is politics, and we're just going to gun for the next election.  We don't care what it means for
the next generation."" And they figure if they just keep on saying no, it'll work for them, they'll get more votes in November."
110,(End videotape)
111,"MR. GREGORY:  David Brooks, how did the pitch work?"
112,"MR. DAVID BROOKS:  Yeah.  I'm, I'm a little dubious that that one's going to work.  I think the questions people always ask at elections like this is, ""Are you better off?"" And I'm not sure people feel better off.  A month ago, I thought people were feeling, ""OK, we're coming out of this."" Last month, real deterioration in the public mood.  And then the second question, which is unique to this moment, is people are upset China and India are passing us and that they may pass us by, and so they want to know, have we made life better for the next generation?  And I know--I've talked to a lot of candidates, Democrat and Republican, who are using the
phrase, ""We're more in debt, and we've got nothing for it."" And so that anger over the long-term future of the country underlines the short-term recession."
113,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Rachel, as I pointed out to Robert Gibbs, the president is saying, ""Look, judge me on my record."" So, if that's the case, Sharron Angle, who is running against Harry Reid, the majority leader, out in Nevada, is doing just that.  This is a portion of the ad
that she's running now."
114,(Campaign ad)
115,MR. GREGORY:  Could she try using more ominous music?  That's the only thing I was going to think of.
116,MS. RACHEL MADDOW:  I was going to say.  And because there's no Sharron Angle in this ad...
117,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
118,MS. MADDOW:  ...it actually just looks like sharronangle.com is a Web site for ominous music.
119,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But, but there is a serious point there, which is what's the state of the economy?  It's bad.  In Nevada, particularly. "
120,MS. MADDOW:  Yeah.
121,MR. GREGORY:  That's what the president's up against.
122,"MS. MADDOW:  Well, sure.  And what the Republicans are trying to do is trying to make this a referendum on the, on the Democrats and on President Obama, on Harry Reid, on the people in power.  And what Democrats are trying to do is make this a choice."
123,"Obviously, anybody who's unhappy about anything in the country, you would hope they would turn it into a vote against the party in power.  The Democrats have their work cut out for them.  Just keep talking about John Boehner, keep talking about Sharron Angle, not just as
the absence of Harry Reid, but as somebody who has a lot of very interesting policy positions of her own."
124,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, that's right."
125,"And, Ed Gillespie, how much of a liability are statements like a Sharron Angle's, talking about that BP fund as a slush fund, the compensation fund? Or gaffes by the current chairman of the Republican Party, how much of a liability is that?  You heard how Robert Gibbs and the president are using particular Republicans as that choice."
126,"MR. ED GILLESPIE:  Right.  Their problem, David, is the more they're talking about distractions like that, the less they're talking about jobs and the economy and debt and spending, which is what people are focused on; and so they look political.  I thought it was interesting, the
president said, ""Oh, they're all politics all the time."" The president's all politics all the time. One of his biggest problems, I think, in his approval rating is he has lost the post-partisan attribute that was such a key to his electoral success when he ran for president because he's become a harsh partisan.  The fact is that we've got unemployment at 9.5 percent.  They said it wasn't going to go above 8 when they passed the stimulus.  We have a $1.4 trillion deficit.  We have $13 trillion in debt.  They've doubled it since coming in, and they're going to triple it in 10 years.  That's their problem.  And people are concerned about that, they're concerned about the economy.  And every time they're talking about Joe Barton or the RNC chairman or John Boehner, attacking those folks by name, they're not talking about the things that Americans want to talk about and hear about."
127,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.  Harold?
128,"FMR. REP. HAROLD FORD JR.  (D-TN):  I think two things:  One, I was in the House when we were in the--Democrats were in the minority, and we often used the language ""take back the majority."" Most Americans didn't recall six, eight, 12--10, 12 years before they wanted a proactive, positive message. Democrats, we have to be careful of talking about the
past.  I think if we want to draw the juxtaposition between George Bush and Barack Obama, one of the great shortcomings of President Bush was that he seemed incredibly inflexible on issues confronting regular Americans, ordinary Americans, be it the economy or the war.  President Obama can't be inflexible as it comes--when it comes to the debt.  He has
a debt commission.  I hope they offer ideas before December.  If they have ideas around entitlement spending, how to cut it, he ought to embrace it.  Two, he ought to extend some of the tax rates, especially around capital gains and dividend taxes, for the simple, simple reason
that you don't want to spook investors or spook the markets anymore, which obviously will have a--an impact on job creation, which could increase unemployment if we don't do it the right way.  And finally, politics is politics.  There'll be a little back and forth, and I think
the American people expect some of that.  But the White House should be aware of one thing: jobs, jobs and jobs is the only number that's going to matter between now and November."
129,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, and..."
130,"REP. FORD:  And if the American people don't feel like they're getting better, we're going to have--my party will have a real problem at the polls."
131,"MS. MADDOW:  What if jobs equals some spending, though?  I mean, if this..."
132,MR. GREGORY:  Right?
133,"MS. MADDOW:  Right?  If there becomes this doctrinaire anti-spending thing going on right now, but if you..."
134,"REP. FORD:  But if you get the tax cuts, you might be able to win some new spending.  That's my whole point.  If you, if you, if you..."
135,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But let me, let me ask you.  Before--but more on the policy prescription..."
136,REP. FORD:  I agree with you.
137,"MR. GREGORY:  ...the point that E.J. Dionne brings up in a column for Monday about what the Democrats are facing is this:  ""Democrats ...  face two very different challenges, and addressing one could make the other worse.  ... [I]ndependent voters are turning on them.  ...  But Democrats are also suffering from a lack of enthusiasm among their"" core ""supporters.  ...  The dilemma is that the arguments that might motivate partisans could further alienate the less-ideological independents."""
138,"MS. MADDOW:  Well, you end, you end up with the situation which again you're back to choice vs. referendum because Republicans, like great strategists like Mr. Gillespie, can argue about how it's all about spending, it's all about debt.  But it's not just talking about the past
to say, ""When Republicans have had the reins, this is what they've done: two wars not paid for, prescription drug benefit not paid for, two tax cuts that mostly benefited the rich not paid for."" They put all that stuff on the deficit, $1.3 trillion sitting there as--in a deficit when
Obama took over, after the previous Democratic president had handed him a surplus.  If you talk about--if Republicans want to run as this fiscally responsible party, it's neat, but it's novel.  It's not how they've actually governed."
139,"MR. GREGORY:  And, David, you know, more on that argument, though.  I spoke to senior Republicans this week in the party who said, ""Look, sometimes we are afraid that we do take the majority back because are we, as Republicans, in a position to offer a policy for how to grow the economy, to offer real policies to create jobs?"" There's a lot of fear out there that, in fact, they don't have great alternatives at the moment to be able to do that."
140,"MR. BROOKS:  Yeah, I, I actually agree with that.  I'm a little scared myself.  You know, you look at what happened in Britain, the Conservative party took over after a long period out of power.  They, they have a real austerity program.  They're really cutting spending, putting the country, which was much worse debt shape than us, on a long-term path to some sort
of fiscal sanity.  I'm not sure the Republicans are ready there, so I'm a little nervous about that.  But the question people are going to ask us is, ""What did President Obama offer, and are we satisfied with that?"" And they're not getting there.  And to me the big picture is that if Harry Hopkins, the great liberal from FDR's administration, came back and said, ""I'm going to create a perfect liberal moment.  We're going to have a big financial crisis caused by Wall Street, sort of; we're going to have the biggest natural disaster in American history caused by an oil company; we're going to have a very talented Democratic president; we're going to
give him some money to spend to create a lot of programs."" And after all that, it's still not a liberal moment, it's a conservative moment, that makes me think liberalism isn't quite going to sell in this country at any moment.  If it's not selling now, it'll never sell. And I think..."
141,MR. GREGORY:  But doesn't that assume that this is a conservative moment? Do you assume that?
142,"MR. GILLESPIE:  Oh, I think, I think there's a great opportunity for conservative policies, and I think the public is open to hearing from us on that.  And I just disagree with David.  Look, in New Jersey and Virginia, we have two Republican governors just been elected, one in a
purple state, Virginia, one in a deep blue state, or at least royal blue, New Jersey, who are acting on what they said they would do, they're governing as they campaigned.  In New Jersey, Governor Christie is trying to change the tailspin, turn things around in New Jersey, taking on the government employee unions there.  In Virginia, Bob McDonnell as governor
eliminated a $4.2 billion deficit, the largest in the history of the Commonwealth of Virginia. We will govern as we said we would.  And I think, you know, Harold just pointed to these rising capital gains taxes and dividend taxes.  You can call them tax increases on the, on the
wealthy.  I think most will say it's tax increases on investment at a time when we need to be creating jobs.  They're going to kick in January 1, 2011.  The first thing Republicans will do is say, ""No.  We're going to keep them in place for a while until we can get the economy growing
again."" And I think most Americans reject the notion that spending equals jobs.  They think spending equals temporary government jobs."
143,"MS. MADDOW:  I think that, I think that most Americans also, though, understand the basic arithmetic that when you're talking about pushing tax cuts that do mostly benefit the wealthy and you're simultaneously talking about getting tough on the deficit, you're talking about a world in which math doesn't work the way most people think it works.  If you're going to talk about tax cuts--I mean, Harold, you, as a Democrat, proposed some very significant tax cuts when you were thinking about running for Senate in, in New York, a huge corporate tax cut, a big payroll tax holiday, and then said simultaneously, ""And we got to get serious about the deficit."""
144,"REP. FORD:  Well, Rachel, in all fairness, the payroll tax..."
145,MS. MADDOW:  Tax cuts hurt the deficit.
146,"REP. FORD:  Right.  But the payroll tax cut--in order to, in order to pay down the debt, you got to do two things.  You got to get your spending in order and you got to grow.  When Bill Clinton was in office, the real advantage we had was that the economy grew.  They made--they took--they made some tough choices around spending.  I was in Congress for a good
part of that.  But at the same time, we had this IT explosion and growth in the country, which created millions of jobs.  My only point is, if you cut the payroll tax for small businesses, you keep money in those communities.  If you really want a stimulus, cut the payroll tax at a
hardware store, cut the payroll tax at a sundry, cut the payroll tax at a..."
147,"MS. MADDOW:  If you really want, if you really want a stimulus, do what we--what's proven to work in stimulus, which is things like extending unemployment benefits, which is something that Republicans are completely blocking."
148,REP. FORD:  Which I...
149,"MR. GREGORY:  But let me, let me..."
150,MS. MADDOW:  It's the most stimulative thing you can do.
151,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, but I want to pose a question to David, and then Ed."
152,REP. FORD:  We have to figure out how to grow the economy.  All right.
153,"MR. GREGORY:  But the question for you, David, you wrote about this this week, what do you do now when there is a debate about rein in spending, deal with the deficit in a serious way--the president says he'll do that over the next couple of years--and the, the additional need for stimulus? Look at what's happening around the country in state budgets and the
cutbacks, a debt of over $400 billion.  You got Governor Paterson in New York saying--conditions around the country are going to look like a depression.  I mean, in my home state where I'm from in California, the cutbacks to social services are, are, are draconian.  What do you do right now in this economic climate?"
154,"MR. BROOKS:  First, you don't think we can fiddle with the economy with fiscal policy.  You don't think we can fine tune fiscal policy to create recessions.  So you don't--I don't think you spend--we've got at one point $5 trillion in debt now.  I don't think you spend any more than
that.  On the other hand, I don't think you cut right now at this moment. I think there are some moderate things you can do that are sensible.  One, extend unemployment insurance.  That's an insane way to start a budget debate.  A lot of people are unemployed, give them the money to survive for another few months.  The second thing, we don't need state
budgets to be contracting at this moment. So what you want to do, you want to tell the states, ""If you give us a long-range plan for fiscal sanity,"" which is being done in New Jersey and other places, ""then we'll give you some money right now."" And that would be a sensible thing to be done.  But it's not going to happen because the political culture in Washington is sick.  And even the--extending unemployment insurance, we had a total gridlock on that because neither party was willing to give anything.  And so these are sensible things that could be done in an ideal world.  Will they be done in this world?  Not likely."
155,"MR. GREGORY:  Ed, your point."
156,"MR. GILLESPIE:  Well, my point was, I want to go back to the math because the fact is, under the Bush tax cuts, we did have 52 months of--in uninterrupted job creation, longest in the history of the country, and revenues were at an all-time high in 2007.  The problem wasn't lack
of revenue, the problem still remains today too much federal spending, and this administration's not addressing that.  And the other problem they have is, in terms of the economy, if you're an employer, well, how are you going to hire right now when you don't know what the impact on
you of this healthcare mandate is going to be and the costs on your premiums?  How are you going to hire if you're not sure whether or not there's going to be an increased cost of energy because of a carbon tax or a cap and trade bill?  How are you going to hire when you don't know if you're going to be able to have your carried interest financing, if you're a small business owner?  How are you going to invest, if you're an investor, when you think your capital gains taxes are going to go up, your dividends are going to go up, and if you're a small business owner, you're going to get hit with a tax increase, too?  No wonder the economy
is stagnant."
157,"MR. GREGORY:  Harold, in the middle of this economic debate, I still come back to the political question, which is, what is it that the Democrats are going to run on?  You do have health care, it's been passed.  Whether it's the right thing, that'll be the subject for the debate and we'll see what happens. Financial regulation appears like it's going to be passed.
This is not 1994 for the Democrats.  It's not chaos theory where Republicans can say nothing gets done.  And yet, Peggy Noonan writes in her column this weekend the following, ""The president, of course, got his victory on health care.  But a funny thing is, normally the press and the public judge a president's effectiveness in large part by legislative victories - whether he has `the ability to get his program through Congress.' Winning brings winning, which increases popularity.  Mr. Obama won on more than health care; he won on stimulus,"" on ""the Detroit bailout.  And yet his poll numbers continue to float downward.  He is not more loved with victory.  To an unusual and maybe unprecedented degree his victories seem like victories for him, and for his party, and for his agenda, but they haven't settled in as broad triumphs that illustrate power and competence."""
158,"REP. FORD:  Because--largely because people don't see job numbers and the economy improving for middle class people, for small business owners. Again, Republicans can't--aren't totally off the hook.  Rachel is right. We--I was there when the Medicare prescription drug bill passed.  That's the largest entitlement that we've passed since--with the introduction of Medicare.  The fact is the tax cuts, these things were not paid for, the war was not paid for.  However, when you become president, you can't argue all the time that the last guy before you created all the problems and he deserves no credit. TARP was a George Bush idea.  The Detroit bailout was a part of a, a Bush idea.  The reality is people are going to
look at today.  The way you get more spending, you've got to make some concessions, I believe, on deficit spending. You got to make some concessions to the business community, who, at the end of the day, without the private--without the, the private markets and the private sector, are growing--we're not going to create enough jobs, not only to grow or to get us out of the mess we're in, but to keep up with population growth. So I think you need a balance.  Cut some deficit spending for the future. What they did in New Jersey--I voted for Jon Corzine, I might add--but what they did--was for him, rather.  I don't live in Jersey.  But what Christie has done has said, ""I will protect teachers if teachers are willing to pay more for their health care, going forward, to reduce the debt."" You got to have some of those concessions. I disagree with David on one thing.  I think there's a climate here in
Washington for that.  If Democrats, including Blue Dogs and CBC members and Hispanic Caucus members, are willing to come together with some Republicans, I think you can find a spending bill, a tax cut bill and one that makes some tough choices going forward on deficit spending."
159,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to, I want to get in here because we obviously continue this with our main time, but I want to talk a bit about the war in Afghanistan, which is such an important focus now.  It's been an important focus on, on this program and others."
160,"Including yours, Rachel, because you're just back from Afghanistan.  And it was very interesting as you went there.  You, you went to Afghanistan to pose two questions, you said:  Does it make sense that the American military is still there?  What does this ongoing war mean for our fighting men and women who are there?  We have a clip from your program,
your interview with Brigadier General Ben Hodges.  He is the head of regional southern command, and you pose a very important question to him. Let's watch."
161,"(Videotape, Tuesday)"
162,"MS. MADDOW:  I know this is a, a difficult question, but if, over the next year, it doesn't, essentially doesn't work to establish better governments in Kandahar, if the police efforts, the policing efforts, security efforts, don't combine to create enough space for Afghan
government to step up in a way that is working, I don't get the sense that there's a plan B.  Is there a plan B? Or is plan B just more time? Is..."
163,BRIG.  GEN. BEN HODGES:  There's no reason why this shouldn't be successful if the Afghans do their part.
164,MS. MADDOW:  Yeah.
165,"BRIG.  GEN. HODGES:  I mean, we have--I, I've never met an officer that didn't want more capability, so I would never turn away more engineers or more military police.  But we have enough to do what we have got to do in Kandahar, assuming that the Afghans step up and do their part."
166,MS. MADDOW:  If they don't?
167,"BRIG.  GEN. HODGES:  Well now, we will have, we will have given them the best chance they've ever had."
168,(End videotape)
169,"MR. GREGORY:  There was a corollary to that in another clip with our chief foreign correspondent, Richard Engel, where you were walking around Kabul and talking about the massive influx of U.S. dollars, primarily, into that country.  Let's show that."
170,"(Videotape, Wednesday)"
171,"MR. RICHARD ENGEL:  It can breed corruption, just having so much money injected into an economy.  Afghanistan is very poor, and it was isolated from the world--except for the last 30 years of war, which was an unpleasant interaction with the world--for hundreds of years.  And now you have a, a totally different scale of economy coming in, billions of dollars a month. This country never saw anything like that."
172,"MS. MADDOW:  But it's going to people who aren't--it's, it's not going to build the country, it's going to people who have private armies.  It's going to people who are--right?"
173,"MR. ENGEL:  Well, next to giant houses, these streets are not even paved."
174,MS. MADDOW:  Yeah.
175,"MR. ENGEL:  I think that gives you an idea of how much these social
services are spreading."
176,"MS. MADDOW:  Right.  You can see, though, why the elites don't want the U.S. to leave, why they don't want the war to end.  The elites are doing awesome out of this war."
177,MR. ENGEL:  They're making a lot of money.
178,(End videotape)
179,"MR. GREGORY:  So you've come back.  What did you conclude about our
efforts there?"
180,"MS. MADDOW:  The, the most--the thing that I felt most strongly was how humbling it is to be there alongside U.S. troops that are doing such unbelievably difficult work and who are such professionals.  Honestly, not to be sappy, but that's the first thing.  The other thing is that the
point of what we're doing there is trying to establish an Afghan government, an Afghan state that is hardened against terrorism so there isn't another 9/11 that comes out of there.  And we are spending $5 and one-half and one-half billion a month there, and that does go into the pockets of a lot of warlords and bullies.  That actually strengthens the Taliban's case against the Afghan government.  So there's a cost to us staying.  And the--what's happening right now with the Afghan government standing up in terms of security and services and the other things they're doing is because they are expecting us to leave, and that deadline looms very
large, not over the fighting with the Taliban, but over the Afghan government standing up.  And it's important that they know we're going to go."
181,"MR. GREGORY:  And it's interesting, David Brooks.  I mean, finding the ideological fault lines here are difficult between left and right, frankly.  I mean, you had Senator McCain make the point that a timeline for withdrawal, which the president has committed to, which is a
beginning of withdrawal, a year from now, is forcing, in many ways, Karzai to make all these side bets, because, again, the Afghans have a long memory.  The U.S. has cut and run before.  They don't think the U.S. is in it for the long haul, so they're making other moves."
182,"MR. BROOKS:  Yeah.  I thought he was too politically cute to set that guideline in any form and his administration's divided on how firm that guideline--that deadline is.  I thought he just said, ""We'll do it till we succeed."" That's what General Mattis believes, that's what General
Petraeus believes.  But the question Rachel asks is the right question. And, frankly, I don't know the answer because whether the Afghans picked up--and we're giving a lot of money to warlords, but we're also giving through--things through the National Solidarity Program to the villages, and they have real social structures.  Nonetheless, when you talk to the
people who are there, there's some disappointment that there hasn't been more progress made on the village-by-village basis to create social structures to ward off the Taliban. In a year, we really do have to look at this again.  Maybe it's just not working.  And even people like me,
who are strong supporters, have to face the reality it's been disappointing."
183,"MR. GREGORY:  Ed, Ed, Ed..."
184,"MS. MADDOW:  If they think it's indefinite, it'll never happen."
185,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, Ed, you were counsel to the president, President Bush, and President Bush told people before he left office, as difficult as Iraq was, Afghanistan will be that much harder.  Is it reasonable for any president to say we can fight this but only unto--until a certain point?"
186,"MR. GILLESPIE:  Well, I think you end up undermining, you know, when you do that, and this is the two--there are obviously clearly two different perspectives here.  You can say, ""Oh, if we don't say there's a hard deadline, they'll never get their act together""; and I would say if you
put a hard deadline, then the bad guys are going to wait this out and, and the folks are--who are--you're hoping to assume power, responsibility are going to be afraid to make the tough decisions that they have to make.  That's the--that is the debate right now.  I would like to see the president actually be more firm in saying we're going to stay and get the job done the same way we did in Iraq.  It worked in Iraq.  I think it would work in Afghanistan.  It would be much, much harder."
187,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  I got...
188,"MS. MADDOW:  We set, we set a deadline for leaving Iraq.  Bush did."
189,"MR. GREGORY:  We got, we got to leave it there.  Thank you all very much."
190,"Up next, our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE. This week, one of the largest spy swaps between the U.S. and Russia since the Cold War.  We're going to take a look back at the spy games of that era and hear the confessions of one Soviet operative involved in one of the most notorious espionage cases ever on U.S. soil, after this brief station break."
191,(Announcements)
192,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  And we're back with our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE. Nearly two decades after the end of the Cold War, a spy swap between the U.S. and Russia this week.  Ten Russian sleeper spies arrested last month in the U.S. are traded for four Russians accused of illegal contact with the West. Fifty-seven years ago, former Soviet spy Elizabeth Bentley
appeared right here on MEET THE PRESS and talked about Soviet espionage and her decision to break with the Communists."
193,"(Videotape, December 6, 1953)"
194,"Announcer:  Our guest on MEET THE PRESS, ladies and gentlemen, is Ms. Elizabeth Bentley, former Soviet spy."
195,"MR. LAWRENCE E. SPIVAK:  Can you explain how you got away with so much for so long, and how others got away with it so long?  Were you fellows so clever, or were we so dumb?"
196,"MS. ELIZABETH BENTLEY:  Well, I would say it was a combination of the two. For one thing, Russia was considered our ally and presumably the intelligence people were concentrating on the Germans.  For another thing, I don't think Americans in general knew too much about Communist espionage methods.  They simply didn't expect that sort of thing.  And
for another thing, the Communists worked very hard and took a lot of precautions to keep these things secret."
197,"MR. ROBERT RIGGS:  When you went to the FBI in 1945 you said cold, I believe. What was your reception?  Were they surprised to see you?  Did they--were they credulous?  Were they incredulous?  Were they--did they doubt your word, or did they accept you as a bonafide spy?"
198,"MS. BENTLEY:  Well, at first I couldn't tell whether they believed or disbelieved because they were extremely courteous, but noncommittal.  But later I was told, about a month, I think, after it was--I'd told them my story, one of them told me that they had been checking frantically and that they were amazed at the accuracy of it."
199,"MR. RIGGS:  Did they indicate they'd had no knowledge of your work before? Was it all brand new to them, do, do you think?"
200,"MS. BENTLEY:  Well, now they wouldn't have been likely to tell me that."
201,"MR. RIGGS:  You could tell by the expression on their face, couldn't you?"
202,"MS. BENTLEY:  No, because the FBI are good, trained intelligence agents, and they keep poker faces."
203,(End videotape)
204,"MR. GREGORY:  Three years after her defection, Bentley, who became known as the ""Red Spy Queen,"" testified before Congress and gave evidence of widespread Soviet espionage in the United States during World War II. The Russian spies sent home this week appear to have uncovered little of value during their time in the U.S.  And we'll be right back."

        MR.  DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday:  The balance of power in Washington and the political shockwaves from news made right here last Sunday when the White House conceded Democrats could indeed lose control of the House. How big of an anti-incumbent wave could be headed Washington's way this November?  This morning the debate continues over the economy, the president's performance, and the future of the Republican Party.  Plus, a look at some of the top races to watch during this summer of fierce campaigning.  With us, four men charged with leading their party to power in Congress, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Senator John Cornyn; chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Senator Bob Menendez; chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, Representative Pete Sessions; and chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Representative Chris Van Hollen.

5,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
6,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
7,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  With the midterm congressional campaign already in full swing, the president lashed out at Republicans during his weekly radio address, accusing the GOP of, ""filibustering the nation's economic recovery."" But the president and his party are not simply fending off a high unemployment rate and sinking poll numbers, they are desperately trying to reframe the debate ahead of what could be a grim fall for the party in power."
8,"Just how grim?  The president's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, upset his party's efforts to manage expectations when, right here last Sunday, he conceded the House Democratic majority is in jeopardy."
9,(Videotape)
10,"MR. ROBERT GIBBS:  I, I think there's no doubt there are enough seats in play that could cause Republicans to gain control.  There's no doubt about that."
11,(End videotape)
12,"MR. GREGORY:  The response was furious from the House speaker, though understated for public consumption."
13,(Videotape)
14,REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  I think the comment was unfortunate.
15,(End videotape)
16,"MR. GREGORY:  Privately, Democrats seethed, complaining the president and his team are unreliable allies in such a tough anti-Washington year. Republicans pounced."
17,(Videotape)
18,"REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH):  With all the trouble that House Democrats are in right now, it was really only a matter of time before the gloves came off.  I just didn't know that the targets would be each other."
19,(End videotape)
20,"MR. GREGORY:  The Cook Political Report identifies 64 House seats now held by Democrats that could fall to a Republican.  The GOP needs 39 to retake the majority.  How does that compare to recent wave elections?  In 2006, Democrats tapped into anti-war, anti-Bush sentiment to capture 30 seats and the majority.  And back in 1994, the Newt Gingrich-led GOP wrote its Contract With America to a House majority, gaining 52 seats. Just two years ago, President Obama swept into Washington on a ""change"" message, reviving hopes of a Democratic political realignment.  Two years later, why is the House up for grabs again?"
21,(Videotape)
22,"MR. CHARLIE COOK:  It's a combination of the overexposure in terms of Democratic seats with a horrible economy and people just sort of very unhappy with Washington.  And, and they're lashing out.  And if Republicans were in power under these circumstances, they would be
the--they'd be the victims of this, too.  You know, this is a very, very ugly political environment."
23,(End videotape)
24,"MR. GREGORY:  Republicans will campaign this fall, saying, ""We are not the free-spending Democrats."" Democrats will urge voters to consider the election a choice, not a referendum on President Obama."
25,(Videotape)
26,PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  This is going to be a choice between the policies that got us into this mess and my policies that are getting us out of this mess.
27,(End videotape)
28,"MR. GREGORY:  And that is where we will start.  I'm joined here now in the very first joint interview by the heads of the House and the Senate Campaign Committees.  For the Senate, Democrat Robert Menendez and Republican John Cornyn.  For the House, Democrat Chris Van Hollen and Republican Pete Sessions."
29,Welcome to all of you for what I'm sure will be a spirited discussion about this balance of power in Washington.
30,"Congressman Sessions, respond to the president.  As he told Chuck Todd, our chief White House correspondent, this week, ""It's going to be a choice this fall between the policies that got us into this mess and my policies which are getting us out of this mess."" Do you think that's how the public's going to see it?"
31,"REP. PETE SESSIONS (R-TX):  I think the, the public sees this as a long-term debt issue of big government, more spending.  The president and the House, at least, are two-tenths through a big government agenda.  And the bottom line is, is that people back home see it where government is doing quite well and the free enterprise system and jobs back home are not doing so well.  I think change is in the air."
32,"MR. GREGORY:  But there is an argument from the president and from Democrats that you got to consider the choice here, there's the president's policies or there's a reminder of the Bush Republican era. Is that a scare tactic?"
33,"REP. SESSIONS:  Yeah, of course it is, because Speaker Pelosi has been in charge for four years and denied the president the ability to continue doing what was successful in this country and that is making the free enterprise system not only more powerful but competitive with the world. Today it's about empowering government, and that is a mistake."
34,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Menendez, you heard Charlie Cook talk about this incredibly ugly political atmosphere right now.  Why is that the case?"
35,"SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ):  Well, look, there's a lot of people hurting in this country, and we realize that, and that's why we've been working to try to change the economy that we inherited.  You know, but this will be a choice election because I know my Republican colleagues would like to have everybody forget that their candidates are on the ballot, but their candidates will be on the ballot.  And it's not just talking about President Bush, it's the policies that they espouse that are in essence Bush's policies.  Those led us to a 72 percent  increase in the debt from $5.7 trillion to $9.8 trillion when Bush left.  It led us to a massive
elimination of the surplus that Bill Clinton gave George Bush, and he had a $1.5 trillion deficit when he left office.  And so our Republican colleagues, who had their hands on the wheel and drove the car off the cliff into the Grand Canyon and the huge crater, don't want to take
responsibility.  It's time that they did."
36,"MR. GREGORY:  But you--Congressman, if this is the reality, apparently the public is not yet keyed into it because here's where we stand, if you look at The Washington Post/ABC News poll, ""If elections were held today, who would you vote for, a Democrat or a Republican candidate in your congressional district?"" And you see the, the results there, the
Republicans have an edge, 47 to 46 among independent voters, and this is something we'll talk about repeatedly this morning, a certain edge going to Republicans, 47 to 40.  How serious is this climate here against the Democrats?"
37,"REP. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD):  Well, David, if you look at that Washington Post/ABC poll, the most, I think, interesting fact that came out of it, and the one that was right on the front page, was the fact that the American people have a lot less confidence in Republicans in
Congress than they do in Democrats in Congress, and that's not surprising.  It's pretty fresh in their memory exactly what those Republican policies did to the economy.  After all, during the whole eight years of the Bush administration, we actually lost over 600,000 private sector jobs.  We're now seeing positive job growth.  And the good news, I think, for the American people is our Republican colleagues are reminding people every day that they would adopt the same policies they had before.  John Boehner, the Republican leader, just this week said
that he's going to move to repeal the Wall Street reform bill.  Now, Wall Street lobbyists have been working very hard to try and defeat that Wall Street reform bill, and what he's saying is, ""Just wait, if I have the opportunity, I'm going to take care of it for you."" So it's that kind of
thing that's going to make it clear to the, the American people what kind of choice they have."
38,MR. GREGORY:  Senator?
39,"SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX):  Well, I'm wondering when our Democratic friends are going to take responsibility for the policies that they've forced down the throat of the American people, which have proven to be very unpopular, including the healthcare bill that the majority of the
population think we ought to repeal and replace with something that will actually bend the cost curve down.  The president's approval rating's about 38 percent among independent voters, and what we're seeing are independent voters who are fleeing the Democrats coming to Republicans because they believe that checks and balances are absolutely essential in 2010 because they want to restrain this, this unprecedented spending binge, the unsustainable debt and the government takeovers.  And I think they see Republicans as the best bet to provide those checks and balances."
40,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, and we'll get into some of the issues.  I want to go back to Congressman Van Hollen on some of the fallout from the news that was made right here last Sunday, Robert Gibbs stating what a lot of people in politics thought was obvious, which is that Democrats are in trouble in the House, they could indeed lose majority status in the House.  But the reaction among Democrats to a member of the administration, a, a top White House adviser actually saying that publicly was not very strong.  Bill Pascrell from New Jersey, as reported in The Hill newspaper on Thursday, said the following, ""If the administration is trying to tell us `stay away from us with an arm's length,' they did a good job.  We don't need a wake-up call.  The White
House needs a wake-up call on the politics of these issues."" What impact did Gibbs' statement have, particularly in some of these toss-up districts?  Do you think it sent the wrong message?"
41,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Well, this is the distinction between a mathematical possibility and a probability.  We have said all along this is going to be a very tough political election for all the reasons people have said. But we've also said at the end of the day we're confident we're going to retain a majority in the House.  The Democrats are on the same page now.
The Democratic leadership in the House had a great meeting with the president, it was positive, we talked about the agenda for the remainder of the year, and we emphasized the fact that voters are going to have this choice that we're talking about here this morning because the Republicans want to get away, essentially, with carping and whining about
everything here without telling the American people what they will do. We're now beginning to hear a little bit about what they would do, and that choice is..."
42,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but go back to the Democrats, Congressman, because there was a real sense among House Democrats that I've spoken to, over a period of time, frustration with the White House.  I mean, here House Democrats took tough votes on health care, on climate change, on the stimulus, and they felt like, you know, this White House is not made up
of very strong allies.  This was really the icing on the cake, wasn't it?"
43,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Well, we know the White House is a strong ally for this reason:  The fact of the matter is the president and the White House know that they need a strong majority in the House and in the Senate in order to complete their agenda, to keep working on that agenda.  They also know that the day after the elections it will be interpreted as a referendum
on the president's policies in the press, whether they like it or not. So we are on the same page."
44,"Now, David, there is some frustration.  The frustration is there are lots of important bills to push for jobs that are sitting over in the Senate. But it's not the fault of the Democratic leadership in the Senate.  I mean, frankly, you know, John Cornyn and his allies have been trying to block a whole lot of very important jobs measures.  We in fact sent a piece of legislation over very recently that would remove these perverse tax incentives to ship American jobs overseas, that give American corporations a bonus if they ship American jobs overseas.  Pete and his colleagues voted against getting rid of that loophole.  It's not in the
Senate.  I hope that the Senate Republicans will join with the Senat Democrats and pass that kind of measure. So the frustration is that, while we've made important progress, we still want to keep working and moving forward on the economy.  And there is a lot of important jobs
legislation bottled up in the Senate."
45,"MR. GREGORY:  How, how--Senator Cornyn, to what extent do you see this as a repeat, potentially, of 1994?  It's interesting, if you remember, Newt Gingrich and the Contract With America sweeping into majority status, winning 52 seats.  And, at the time, Adam Clymer wrote this in The New York Times, which caught my attention:  ""Republicans based much of their
push for major gains on the notion that the Democrats, who in '92 won control of the White House while retaining the Senate and the House, had since disappointed the voters.  That made it possible, Gingrich said, to put out `one clear message from Washington' which could not be done in the '80s, when control of the White House and Congress was divided between the parties."" I mean here, just like 1994, Republicans have made a choice:  unity of opposition to everything the president has put forward."
46,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, I think every election's different, David, and this election'll be different from 1994.  No matter what the actual count is, it will be a different election.  But I want to say to my friend Chris, the--you know, the problem is the Democrats have been able to pass almost everything on the president's agenda, and they've been doing it with a ""my way or the highway"" approach without reaching out and seeking compromise and Republican support.  And, as a result, the Business Roundtable, one of the big allies of the--of this White House, has come out and given a list of job-killing policies that have been passed, which make capital, make investment, make job creators sit on the sidelines. And if there's one area where this administration has failed miserably, it's been in creating an environment where job creators will make those investments and create jobs and grow the economy.  And that's what I think the American people are reacting to, because people without a job can't pay their mortgage and they're losing their home. And we've seen everything on the Democrat agenda except for the number one thing on the mind of most Americans.  That is jobs, ""How can I keep my home? How can we restrain the growth of government when runaway spending and unsustainable debt?"""
47,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Menendez, if you look at where the president stands, these are policy issues that the senator is bringing up.  Here's the president's approval rating, it's upside down, he's at 48 percent disapproval. The Washington Post poll from this week that we referenced
shows that six in 10 Americans lack faith in the president.  And here's how the Post reported it:  ""Public confidence in Obama has hit a new low, according to the latest poll from The Washington Post-ABC.  Four months before midterm elections that will define the second half of his term, nearly six in 10 voters say they lack faith in the president to make the
right decisions for the country, and a clear majority once again disapprove of how he's dealing with the economy."" Is November a referendum on Obama?"
48,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  No, November's a--is a, a choice election.  And the reality is, is I listen to, to John talk about the agenda in the Senate, the Republicans have been the job killers in the Senate.  In essence, they have used the filibuster in an unprecedented way in the nation's
history to stop progress on everything that we have tried to do.  So, as we're trying to help the private sector grow jobs by giving them tax incentives, net operating loss, bonus depreciation, giving them incentives to small businesses to hire people, they have said no, no, no, no.  Now, the problem is, is that in this choice election it will be far less than the president.  It will be about whether or not we go back to the Bush economic policies that they espouse, the policies that John Kyl, the number two Republican in the Senate, said..."
49,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but you just heard, but, but you just heard your, your, your colleague from the Congress, from the House say, ""Look, it's going to be perceived as a referendum on Obama and his policies."" How does it not?"
50,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  Well, no.  I think what, what Chris said, at the end of the day the results, regardless of what they are..."
51,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
52,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  ...positive or negative, may be viewed that way.  But look, when John Kyl says that you don't have to pay for $680 billion of tax cuts whatsoever, just add it onto the debt, but you can't even take care of $30 billion to have people who are unemployed in this country get through the emergency of the moment, you know, it's a big difference. And when we look at jobs, the reality is we lost 2.9 million jobs in the first six months of the president's time that he inherited from Bush.  We created 860,000 jobs in the first six months of this year.  That's a 3.7 million [unintelligible]."
53,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But, Congressman Van Hollen, here's the reality. In Newsweek, Howard Fineman in his column reports it out in terms of what Democrats are facing as a result of the president's policies.  We'll put it on the screen.  ""Obama won over [male independent] voters in 2008, and they may be all that stands between Democrats and catastrophe this fall. ...  The Democrats' support among that group has fallen to as low as 35 percent in some polls.  And the reasons are clear.  They do not believe that Obama's actions have produced results - and for these practical voters, nothing else matters. The $787 billion stimulus bill is widely regarded as an expensive, unfocused dud.  ...  Healthcare reform remains, for most voters, a 2,000-page, impenetrable, and largely irrelevant mystery.  The BP oil spill has hurt Obama's ability to fend off GOP charges that he's ineffective as a leader. Democrats are hoping to win back this group with one strategy:  attacking the Republicans, individually and as a group.  ...  The plan is not to blame George W. Bush ...  but to warn that a return to the GOP brand ...  would be a
disaster."" And we're hearing all this this morning."
54,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Well, what you're, what you're hearing is--as, as Bob said, look, we know that we have a long way to go on the economy.  People are still hurting, that's absolutely clear.  But we also know what the American people know, which is the day George Bush lost--left office, we were losing 700,000 jobs a month.  And during the full eight years of the Bush administration we lost private sector jobs.  We are now beginning to climb out.  And what we are saying is yes, let's focus on the policies, because why in the world would we want to go back to the same economic agenda that created that mess, that, that lost jobs for eight years?  And I think the challenge that our colleagues have here, Pete and John, is to
say to the American people, how do you expect to do the same thing and get a different result?  I mean, that, that's Einstein's definition of insanity, right?"
55,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Congressman, is that fair?  Is that what, is that what Republicans stand for today?  Is it the party of George Bush?  Is it the economic approach of George Bush?"
56,"REP. SESSIONS:  First of all, it's not truthful.  People had jobs when Republicans were, not only in charge, but George Bush was there.  We doubled the size of the economy over 12 years.  We did things that would empower the free enterprise system.  Here's what the facts of the case are.  There will be candidates who will be on the ballot back home facing the Democrats who have voted in the 90 percent realm with Nancy Pelosi to raise taxes and bigger government, and a healthcare plan which we cannot sustain and will quite likely bankrupt, not only states, but business also.  These candidates from top to bottom, whether we talk about Rick Berg and Kristi Noem, all the way down to David Rivera in Florida, are saying we must live within our own means, we cannot spend what we don't have, and we must be able to sustain what we're doing.  That's why we're going to win."
57,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, so what is the message your candidates are going to send about President Obama?  What has he done with government, to government?"
58,"REP. SESSIONS:  Well, well, first of all, they're going to run against the, the person who's on the ballot with them.  And that person has voted for more spending and big taxes and more of an agenda that's about empowering Washington, D.C., not back home.  They are going to say we should read the bills before we vote on them, we should make sure we live within our means, and, perhaps most of all, get behind an agenda where the American people are, which began for us one year ago in August when Republicans would attend town hall meetings and hear about health care."
59,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Look,"
60,REP. SESSIONS:  Democrats fled.
61,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  But, but, but, David, I mean, you heard the very beginning of the answer to your question, a defense of the George Bush economy and the George Bush years.  And I don't think the American people see it that way, because they know we had a meltdown in the financial sector, they know we lost jobs.  And so when they hear the Republican
leader John Boehner say he wants to repeal the Wall Street reform bill, which is an effort to make sure that the American people and the whole economy are not again held hostage by bad bets on Wall Street, they recognize that they do, in fact, want to go back to those policies.  They have, they have Joe Barton, the head of their energy committee--who, who would be the head of the energy committee, apologizing to BP.  It's a, it's a big oil agenda.  They've got, they've got the, the folks who oppose the legislation to try and remove the tax loopholes that help export U.S. jobs overseas.  We want to shut those loopholes.  They, they hear all this and they see that what they're going to get if you had, you know, Republicans in charge, is that economic agenda.  And they, they can't answer that basic question:  What, what are you going to get that's different?"
62,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, Senator, what, what distinguish the Republican Party of today from the Republican Party under President Bush's rule with regard to spending, which is where it got out of control under Republican rule, that now conservatives are so upset about."
63,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, let's look at a few facts.  I, I, thank you for the opportunity because I wanted to respond to what Chris said.  You know, in the last year that President Bush was in office, 2008, the deficit was 3.2 percent of the gross domestic product.  Today it's 10 percent.
Just--we just hit the $13 trillion cap on national debt, $2.3 trillion..."
64,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let me just stop you, Senator.  Wait a minute."
65,SEN. CORNYN:  ...since Obama...
66,"MR. GREGORY:  Where did some of that debt come from?  The president of the United States was George Bush when they passed a, a huge TARP, which was to bail out the banks.  I mean, that's what ran up a lot of debt, as well. You're saying that a Republican..."
67,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, you're ignoring..."
68,"MR. GREGORY:  ...was, was somehow different."
69,"SEN. CORNYN:  You're ignoring the stimulus that was--failed according to the own, the president's own standards.  He said it was supposed to keep unemployment to 8 percent.  A $2.6 trillion healthcare bill, which I agree with, with Pete, will bankrupt not only the private sector but the states and the federal government creating a new entitlement program.  My
point is that, you know, unemployment was roughly 6.9 percent when President Obama was elected.  Now it's 9.5 percent.  The deficit was 3.2 percent the last year President Bush was in office.  Now it's 10 percent. The debt was $2.3 trillion lower when--in 2008 than it is now because of runaway spending and debt."
70,MR. GREGORY:  So my question is still...
71,SEN. CORNYN:  Those are some of the policies people reacting to.
72,"MR. GREGORY:  ...what is the distinction of the Republican Party of today vs. the, the Bush record that you're defending?"
73,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, I think what people are looking for, David, are checks and balances.  They've had single party government, and it's scaring the living daylights out of them.  It's keeping job creators on the sidelines rather than investing and creating jobs.  That's why the
private sector isn't creating jobs."
74,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, can't you understand people will see that as a strategy of saying no rather than saying yes to something?"
75,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, my constituents in Texas, I have to tell you, to all the bad ideas that they hear coming out of Washington these days, no is a good start.  And then they want us to replace it with commonsense policies that actually make sense.  But the problem is, the, the--our friends on the Democratic side, including the president, have passed one unpopular policy measure after another and told the American people, ""We don't care what you think, we're--we know what's, better than you do, what's good for you."" And I think the birds are coming home to roost."
76,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  Well, David, if the check and balance is to go back to exactly the same policies that gave us a 72 percent increase in the national debt to nearly $9.8 trillion.  If the check and balance is to take Bill Clinton's $230 billion surplus and make it a $1.5 trillion deficit, if the check and balance is the malaise of the Bush years in which incomes for families remained stagnant and jobs were lost, if the check and balance is to be with big oil, big insurance, and Wall Street against the average individual, then that's where the Republican
Party is at."
77,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me, let me have--before we take a break and we'll come back and we'll talk about some particular issues where the two sides will debate, I want to ask one last question about the president's standing and, and to what extent it has an impact.  Politico's piece on Thursday was very interesting, the headline ""Why Obama loses even by winning."" And this is what they reported.  ""Thursday's passage of financial reform just a couple of months after the passage of a comprehensive healthcare overhaul should decisively end the narrative that President Barack Obama represents a Jimmy Carter-style case of naive hope crushed by the
inability to master Washington.  Yet the mystery remains:  Having moved swiftly toward achieving the very policy objectives he promised voters as a candidate, Obama is still widely perceived as flirting with a failed presidency."""
78,"Congressman Van Hollen, this is not 1994 where Democrats were having a difficult time achieving anything.  There has been major achievement here, and yet, are Democrats reaping the rewards?"
79,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  There has...
80,MR. GREGORY:  Reaping the benefits?
81,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  There absolutely has been major achievement, and you've ticked some of those off; but the fact remains that the economy is soft. And when you have a soft economy, people, understandably, are anxious. And the question they're going to have on their minds when they go into that voting booth and face two different candidates is, who is going to
best respond to the economy?  And I have to say, we're some minutes into this discussion yet and we still have not heard from our colleagues what they would do differently than the Bush economic agenda which got us into this mess?  We are now in positive job growth."
82,"Let me make this point, we have the situation right now where our Republican colleagues are holding hostage an extension of middle class tax cuts.  They've said we're only going support a continuation of middle class tax cuts, those for people under $250,000, if you also extend the
Bush tax cuts for the very wealthy.  And by the way, that $700 billion over 10 years--you hear all this talk about deficit reduction--that they don't want to pay for, they want to leave that to children and grandchildren, we can make great progress today if our Republican
colleagues here agreed to allow those middle class tax cuts to be extended without having to add $700 billion to the deficit that our grandchildren and children will have to pick up."
83,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator Menendez, Senator Bayh, another centrist Democrat that said raising taxes on wealthier Americans by allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire in January would be a real mistake in this economy.  Is that wrong?"
84,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  Well, the bottom line is what would be a mistake is to add $700 billion of debt to the next generation.  You know, when, when the number two Republican in the Senate, Jon Kyl, says, ""We don't have to pay for that. We don't have to pay for it,"" you know, I am tired of listening to the lectures about spending and debt when they wracked up
record debt, when they are willing to put $700 billion of debt on the next generation, and when you don't have to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest people in the country, but you can't help working Americans trying to get a job who presently are unemployed."
85,"MR. GREGORY:  Final point before break, is President Obama an asset or a liability on the campaign trail?"
86,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Oh, he's absolutely an asset."
87,MR. GREGORY:  So he'll campaign across the country for Democrats?
88,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Absolutely.  And he's been doing that.  He was in Michigan the other day at, at a car battery factory.  He's been around the country. He's an asset, and he's also very clearly drawing the distinctions here, what the choices are for voters going forward."
89,"MR. GREGORY:  We're going to take a break.  We're going to come back. We're going to talk a little bit more about the Republicans, what the prescription is should they get the majority in the House.  We'll be right back.  More of our debate on Decision 2010 and the balance of power in Washington right here on MEET THE PRESS."
90,(Announcements)
91,"MR. GREGORY:  The debate for the fall campaign.  More of our discussion with the chairs of the four congressional campaign committees, right after this brief commercial break."
92,(Announcements)
93,"MR. GREGORY:  And we are back, continuing our Decision 2010 debate with the four leaders responsible for winning congressional races for their party this fall."
94,"And, Congressman Sessions, I want to go back to you.  This has been a debate so far this morning about, you know, the relative merits of Republican rule during the Bush years and what this president has or has not accomplished so far.  I think what a lot of people want to know is if Republicans do get back into power, what are they going to do?"
95,"REP. SESSIONS:  It's quite simple that the American people do understand the agendas that are before us.  They understand what the president and the speaker stand for, and they understand what Republicans stand for. Republicans, and especially our candidates who are all over this country, very strong standing with the American people back home, we need to live
within our own means.  And certainly the projections that are ahead including health care and the projections for unemployment for a long time and debt for as far as we can see is staggering.  We need to live within our own means.  Secondly, we need to make sure that we read the bills.  These bills are so bad, which is why we don't have a budget that
is being looked at now.  The 2011 budget is staggering in terms of taxes, and the, the discipline that is lacking from this House Democratic leadership to even debate and bring the bill for the budget and appropriations to the floor is a lack of leadership.  And lastly..."
96,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Congressman, that's a, that's a pretty gauzy agenda so far.  I mean, what specific--what painful choices are Republicans prepared to make?  Are they going to campaign on repealing health care, for instance, repealing financial regulation?  Would you like to see
those two things done? "
97,"REP. SESSIONS:  Well, first of all, let's go right to it.  We're going to balance the budget.  We should live within our own means, and we should read the bills and work with the American people."
98,MR. GREGORY:  How do you do it?  Tell me how you do it.  Name a painful choice that Republicans are prepared to say we ought to make.
99,"REP. SESSIONS:  Well, first of all, we need to make sure that as we look at all that we are spending in Washington, D.C., with, not only the, the entitlement spending but also the bigger government, we cannot afford anymore. We have to empower the free enterprise system.  See, this is where..."
100,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman, these are not specifics."
101,"REP. SESSIONS:  Oh, they..."
102,"MR. GREGORY:  And voters get, get tired of that."
103,"REP. SESSIONS:  That, that..."
104,MR. GREGORY:  You want to deal with entitlement spending...
105,REP. SESSIONS:  They are...
106,"MR. GREGORY:  ...will you raise the retirement age on Social Security, will you cut benefits in Social Security?"
107,"REP. SESSIONS:  Let, let--let's go..."
108,MR. GREGORY:  Will you repeal health care?
109,REP. SESSIONS:  Let's go right to it.
110,MR. GREGORY:  Do it.
111,"REP. SESSIONS:  And Chris talked right about it.  He wants to diminish employers' abilities to be able to be competitive across this world.  We need to make sure that we allow employers, which was in that 52-page report that was presented to the president of the United States by CEOs in this country, we need to go back to the exact same agenda that is empowering the free enterprise system rather than diminish it."
112,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator, I'm sorry, I'm not hearing an answer here on specific--what painful choices to really deal with the deficit.  Is Social Security on the table?  What will Republicans do that, that, that would give them--like '94, there was a Contract With America.  What are
voters going to say, ""Hey, this is what Republicans will say yes to""?"
113,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, the president has a debt commission that reports December the 1st, and I think we'd all like to see what they come back with.  We've got three of our most outstanding members on that commission--Mike Crapo, Tom Coburn and Judd Gregg--and I--my hope is
they'll come back with a bipartisan solution to the debt and particularly entitlement reform, as you, as you mentioned.  But I..."
114,"MR. GREGORY:  But wait a minute, conservatives need a, a Democratic president's debt commission to figure out what it is they want to cut?"
115,"SEN. CORNYN:  I said we need to do this on a bipartisan basis.  We've, we've had a, we've had a..."
116,MR. GREGORY:  But what is the Republican Party stand for with regard...
117,SEN. CORNYN:  ...we've had a partisan juggernaut.
118,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
119,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, I mean, in, in part, what I alluded to earlier is what people are tired of is the runaway spending and the debt, and I think that is a positive agenda--smaller government, living with their means."
120,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you, do you, do you campaign to repeal health care if you, if you have majority status?"
121,"SEN. CORNYN:  I think repeal and replace it with a commonsense solution that will bend the cost curve.  This bill has almost no reform. Individual businesses, individuals, and states are going to suffer a great financial loss as a result to the huge expansion of entitlements in
this healthcare bill.  We had alternatives, as you saw, at the summit that Lamar Alexander and others articulated..."
122,"MR. GREGORY:  Right, and we're..."
123,SEN. CORNYN:  ...that the president...
124,"MR. GREGORY:  We're not going to--we, we won't debate all the issues with health care, but I just want to get..."
125,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, you, well, you asked what the positive..."
126,"MR. GREGORY:  What about, what about repealing financial reform?"
127,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, you asked what the..."
128,MR. GREGORY:  Is that something you think that Republicans would stand for?
129,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, you asked what the positive agenda was."
130,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
131,"SEN. CORNYN:  And I think it's clear that, that Republicans had a positive alternative in health care.  I think Bob Corker was very articulate in saying he hoped for a, a, a compromise that would actually make sense instead of preserving the too-big-to-fail and--doctrine and
the, and the prospect of bailouts."
132,"MR. GREGORY:  So repeal financial regulation, yes, no or maybe?"
133,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, I think--I mean, this is a 2,300-page bill that not even Chris Dodd, the principal Senate author, knows--he said, ""We don't know exactly how this will impact the economy or our financial systems for some time to come."" I mean, that's part of the problem, as Pete said, passing legislation with unintended consequences and based on an ideological approach as opposed to, ""Let's solve the problem"" and to help encourage the growth of the economy.  As the folks in the business roundtable said, the job-killing agenda of this administration is to make..."
134,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
135,"SEN. CORNYN:  ...is the reason why people are sitting on the sidelines--the job creators, the investors, the entrepreneurs."""
136,SEN. MENENDEZ:  Let me answer...
137,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, one..."
138,SEN. MENENDEZ:  Let me answer the question for you.
139,"MR. GREGORY:  ...but one thing that is fair, just to challenge you as well, you look at polling, there are a lot of voters out there who would like to go back and begin at scratch and begin all over and--rather than supporting the Obama economic policies.  That's a reality."
140,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  Well, I think, actually, when you look at the choice between where the president has taken the country from what he inherited vs. what our colleagues espouse, which is in essence the Bush voodoo economics, the reality is, in that choice, they have a very clear preference for the president's economic policies.  Let me answer the question that my dear friend John wouldn't.  Yes, they want to repeal health care, and they say replace.  Well, you'll have a whole host of issues that you enjoy today that won't be enjoyed anymore.  You won't see seniors closing that prescription drug gap that they have, you won't be able to have pre-existing conditions no longer be a bar to you getting insurance; you won't have a child born at birth who now will be able never--if they have a defect--to no longer be denied insurance.  And yes, we have cost controls in that bill.  On Wall Street reform, look, two weeks before, two weeks before Wall Street reform bill was passed, you know, a hedge fund manager ultimately raised a million dollars for Republican candidates two weeks before the bill was being voted on, and they tried to stop us four times in the Senate before we got the Wall Street reform.  I think that people in America believe in a free market as we as Democrats do, but there's a difference between a free market and a free fall market."
141,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Congressman..."
142,SEN. MENENDEZ:  They would permit the free fall market.
143,"MR. GREGORY:  ...you do have exploding debt in this country, you have near 10 percent unemployment and the president made a major policy agenda built around creating a new government entitlement.  That's hurting him with a lot of voters."
144,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  The fact is, as the CBO has, has scored, which is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, that if you look at a 20-year period, you actually reduce the deficit by $1.4 trillion, which means if you do what they want to do and repeal it, they're actually adding to the deficit.  If, if I could just go make a couple points here because Pete
really said what we're saying.  I wrote it down.  They want to go back to the same agenda, the same agenda that got us into this mess.  Now, the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy in 2001, 2003, we know they didn't create any jobs because at the end of that eight-year period you had a loss of private sector jobs, and that is fact. And why in the world we would want
to go back to that agenda, I think, is a mystery to me and it's going to be a mystery to the American people going forward.  What he, what he--they do have some creative ideas, including the guy who's their point person on the, on the budget committee, which is the road map plan, and what they would do there is go back to a proposal to partially privatize
Social Security, which is something Pete has supported, and, and we, we can have that debate, but the American people need to know that.  And they also have a plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program; you give the senior the voucher--by the way, the value of that voucher is going to decrease substantially--and we're going to throw you over to the
insurance industry.  Those are the ideas their point person on the budget committee has, and people need to..."
145,MR. GREGORY:  Congressman...
146,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  ...to understand that.
147,"MR. GREGORY:  ...Congressman Sessions, I want to ask you some, some political operative questions, as well, that, that play a role here. Some of it has to do with money and how much candidates can raise.  It affects both parties, it affects the ability to get out the vote, which
is very important, as you know, in a midterm race.  Why is it that in this political environment that we have been--all been talking about, it has been difficult for Republicans to raise the kind of money that Democrats successfully raised when they were challenging Republican rule
in 2006?"
148,"REP. SESSIONS:  In 2006, Republicans had more money, and we lost.  And one thing that, that is very apparent is the American people are not after money, they're after progress.  And the progress that's being made in Washington is what Democrats will be judged for.  The progress that they're making, despite what is being said here about George Bush..."
149,MR. GREGORY:  So--but so raising money doesn't...
150,REP. SESSIONS:  ...is about...
151,MR. GREGORY:  ...raising money doesn't matter?
152,"REP. SESSIONS:  You know, during the last few months Republicans have raised more money, and we will probably be outspent maybe even 1.7-to-1. But the American people understand what is happening in Washington, D.C., and this is an agenda that's out of control."
153,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to talk about the tea party as well, Senator Cornyn. The impact, whether it's Sarah Palin or some prominent tea party candidates--we'll put a few that are running in Senate races, ones to watch this year in terms of tea party impact:  Sharron Angle running against Majority Leader Harry Reid, of course, in Nevada; Marco Rubio running against Charlie Crist, who is now an independent running for the Senate, and we're still waiting to see who the Democrat will be; and of course, Rand Paul, a Republican in Kentucky.  And yet, there are some real debates going on about the role of the tea party and whether there are racist elements within the party itself.  The NAACP had its meeting this week and talked about--called on the tea party to really stand up to some of those forces.  This is how it was reported in the Kansas City Star this week.  The headline, ""The NAACP resolution addresses tea
parties."" The organization ""passed a resolution Tuesday calling on all people--including tea party leaders--to condemn racism within the tea party movement.  ..."
154,"The resolution asserts that tea party supporters have engaged in `explicitly racist behavior, displayed signs and posters intended to degrade people of color generally and President Obama specifically.' ..."
155,"The tea party movement is not just about higher taxes and limited government, the resolution says, `but something that could evolve and become more dangerous for that small percentage of people that really think our country has been taken away from them.'"" Is this a problem?"
156,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, I think it's slanderous to suggest that the vast movement of citizens who've gotten off the couch and gotten--showed up at town hall meetings and tea party events, somehow to smear them with this, this label, it's just, there's just no basis for it.  But I think the--what the tea party movement demonstrates, and I think the, the, the enthusiasm that we're seeing from independents and Republicans, is that if Washington isn't going to change itself, then we're going to change Washington.  And I think that's what we're seeing.  And if, if folks like in Nevada, for example, 14 percent unemployment since Harry Reid--now
that Harry Reid is running for re-election, 20--after 27 years in the United States Congress, if you want to continue those policies and those sorts of results, then go ahead and vote for Harry Reid."
157,MR. GREGORY:  Well...
158,"SEN. CORNYN:  And if you want, if you want change, if you want people who are willing to live within their means and to rein in this runaway spending and debt, then, then they have an alternative."
159,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, you talk about Nevada.  Let's look at the latest polling out of Nevada..."
160,SEN. CORNYN:  Mm-hmm.
161,"MR. GREGORY:  ...that shows, in fact, Senator Reid pulling now ahead of Sharron Angle.  And we can put those on the screen.  He's now up 44 to 37 percent.  This comes after a time when Sharron Angle has made some pretty extreme statements about a slush fund, calling the BP compensation fund a slush fund, something she later backtracked from.  She's talked about
Second Amendment remedies for her political opponents.  And the criticism is that the tea party is, in fact, injecting candidates who are too extreme to actually win re-election.  Is, is that a concern for you?"
162,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, let's, let's look what Harry Reid has said.  He's called the former chairman of the Federal Reserve a hack.  He declared the Iraq war lost and the surge a failure before it even started in 2007. And he called the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
incompetent.  I mean, Harry Reid is known for his gaffes.  But this isn't going to be about personalities, I believe, this is going to be about policies.  That's really the--where our colleagues don't..."
163,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  But that, but..."
164,"SEN. CORNYN:  ...on the other, side don't seem to understand."
165,MR. GREGORY:  But this is different.  This is a question of whether some of these tea parties are too extreme.
166,SEN. CORNYN:  It's the policies are unpopular.
167,"MR. GREGORY:  You've got Rand Paul who got into trouble with extreme comments, and you have a movement of tea partiers who, in effect, are arguing that they should govern when they're fundamentally opposed to government.  How much of a problem is that?"
168,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, I believe these are, these, these are citizens who should not be demonized and marginalized.  These are people who are concerned about the direction of the country.  They have every right to participate in the political process and to make sure their views are represented in Washington, because they see Washington running away with,
not only their present prosperity, but also the burden it's putting on our children and grandchildren."
169,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Congressman, you, you heard Senator Lott say this week that if they're elected they should be co-opted by the Republican Party, or should there be a tea party caucus in the House?"
170,"REP. SESSIONS:  I think it's clear to me that what--when I look at the tea party, it's about one-third Democrat, one-third Republican, one-third independents.  But 100 percent of them are sure that the agenda that is taking place in Washington, D.C., is about extremism and is about bankrupting this country and every state within this country.  And Chris talked about how the federal government will see this $1.2 trillion surplus, or at least the diminishment of the debt, but they're passing that on to other people and diminishing employment at the same time.  This agenda is outrageous, and the American people are seeing in our candidates where we're going to talk about balance."
171,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman--all right.  But, Congressman Van Hollen, Van Hollen, what is the impact of the tea party in the fall?"
172,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Well, it's a, a mixed bag for the Republicans.  On the one hand, there's a lot of energy on the tea party's side.  On the other hand, it is driving a lot of their candidates farther and farther to the right.  Most of the districts that are in play are the swing districts,
they're centrist districts, and what the tea party movement has done is take a lot of their nominees farther to the right.  We saw in a special election last year in upstate New York, a seat that had been held by the Republicans since Abraham Lincoln was president, that the tea party movement drove the more moderate Republican candidate out of the race
entirely.  And Bill Owens ran a good campaign, focused on jobs and the economy, and won a seat that had been held by a Republican since the Civil War.  So there's a real danger for them in moving farther to the right, but that is the reality of what's happening."
173,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Menendez, did the NAACP go too far?"
174,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  Well, I think they expressed their views based upon signs, statements, and other things, and so I'll let their judgment as the nation's conscience on race stand for their own proposition.  But I will say this about the tea party.  Look, it's not about marginalizing
people.  I'm glad to see people get involved in their government.  But there's a reason that my colleague here wanted Sue Lowden vs. Sharron Angle.  There's a reason he wanted Trey Grayson in Kentucky vs. Rand Paul.  Because he understood that the people who won those races in the tea party movement are too extreme in their positions even for their
state.  When you want to put radioactive waste in Yucca Mountain, when you want to phase out Social Security, when you want to abolish the Department of Education, it's not going to sell in Nevada. When Rand Paul, you know, says that it's un-American to pressure BP to do the right thing in the gulf, it's not going to sell.  So, at the end of the day, it's not because they are part of a movement, it's because their positions are too extreme for the general election environment."
175,"MR. GREGORY:  We've got about a minute left.  I want to go around the table here.  Senator Cornyn, I will start with you.  A prediction for the fall, what kind of pickups do you think you're looking at, if any, in the Senate?"
176,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, we're leading or tied in about eight seats currently held by Democrats, and, if the election were held today, it'd be a pretty good election.  But we've got almost 100, a little bit more than 100 days to go, and it's anybody's guess.  But we're looking for a pretty good November 2nd."
177,MR. GREGORY:  How many seats do you think?
178,SEN. CORNYN:  I don't know.
179,MR. GREGORY:  Senator?
180,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  Democrats in the Senate will be a majority after this election, despite midterm election history and headwinds.  We are competitive. Six weeks ago we were sitting here with you.  We are competitive in a series of races that we weren't in--that a Republican
held that we wouldn't have said that six weeks ago."
181,MR. GREGORY:  Do Democrats hold the House?
182,"REP. SESSIONS:  I think our candidates are going to take us from good to great to victory, and I think Republicans can win in November."
183,MR. GREGORY:  How many seats?
184,REP. SESSIONS:  I think we're going to be slightly over 40.
185,MR. GREGORY:  Slightly over 40.  That means the majority's gone.  Where do you see it?
186,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  I know these guys are popping the champagne bottles already over there, but the fact of the matter is the Democrats will retain a majority in the House.  We know that it's going to be a tough election.  But the fact of the matter is when voters focus on the choice before them, whether it's to continue the progress we've made or go back to the policies that got us into this mess to begin with..."
187,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
188,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  ...the choice is clear.
189,"MR. GREGORY:  We are going to, we are going to leave it there.  Thank you all very much.  We'll have you back before election time."
190,"Up next, a look back in our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE.  It was 1974, a tumultuous year then for the GOP after Watergate.  The chairs of both political parties appeared right here on MEET THE PRESS and offered their predictions for the upcoming midterm elections.  Did they get it right?
We'll find out after this brief station break."
191,(Announcements)
192,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  And we are back with our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE. Predictions and elections go hand in hand.  This morning we've heard all their predictions for this November.  But here's a look back at the spin coming from both parties just three days ahead of the 1974 midterms, when things were looking bleak for the Republicans.  The Watergate scandal was
still looming large following President Nixon's resignation in August, and unemployment was at a three-year high.  November 3rd, the heads of the two major national political committees, Robert Strauss, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and Mary Louise Smith, chairman of the Republican National Committee, appeared right here on MEET THE PRESS and
tried to put their best foot forward."
193,"(Videotape, November 3, 1974)"
194,"MR. ROBERT STRAUSS:  I think every poll shows that people in this nation are disturbed about the economy.  They're disturbed about their way of life.  I think the polls also show by two or 2 1/2-to-1 that the, the people of this nation have more confidence in the Democrats' ability to, to meet their economic needs, meet the great unmet needs of this nation,
and deal with their problems, the people's problems."
195,MR. LAWRENCE SPIVAK:  You really think it's going to be an endorsement of the party and not a protest vote?
196,"MR. STRAUSS:  Well, I think it's going to be a referendum, if you will, on who's best able to come to grips with the great problems facing this nation today, and I think we'll win that referendum.  Yes."
197,"I think we'll gain five seats in, in the Senate, conceivably four and conceivably six.  I know that's an extreme estimate, but I believe we'll do that well.  I think in the House that we'll gain 27 to 31 or two seats.  A little more difficult to predict.  I think we'll do that well."
198,"MR. SPIVAK:  Ms. Smith, many political observers and pollsters predict Republican disaster Tuesday because of Watergate, inflation, and the recession.  Do you have any reason to believe that they might be wrong?"
199,"MS. MARY LOUISE SMITH:  I think there is reason to believe that they might be wrong.  I, I see a movement in the country and I see a turning around on some of the races, and I think we're going to do much better than people have predicted."
200,MR. SPIVAK:  Will you be as brave as Mr. Strauss and give us your predictions of what you think you're going to do?
201,"MS. SMITH:  I don't know whether that's bravery or not.  I will not make an estimate.  I think it does nothing but prove whether I'm a good prognosticator or whether I am not, and I have not played the numbers game.  I'll just say that I think we're going to do much better than

203,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, not even the Democratic Party chairman guessed correctly just how much of a landslide victory it would be for his party. The Democrats picked up 48 seats in the House, increasing their majority to above the two-thirds mark.  They also picked up four seats in the
Senate.  These new members would become known collectively, of course, as ""Watergate Babies."""

        MR. DAVID GREGORY: This Sunday, the president signs financial regulation this week as part of what the administration calls ""recovery summer."" But where are the jobs? The Fed chief says the future is uncertain. Will things get worse before they get better? Plus, how Washington's debate about your taxes will affect economic growth. It's all part of my one-on-one discussion this morning with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.

9,MR. ROBERT GIBBS: How did we not ask the right questions? How did you all not ask the right questions? How did other people not ask the right questions?
10,(End videotape)
11,"MR. GREGORY: What does this episode say about racially-charged politics, the media, and the post-racial presidency of Barack Obama? Our roundtable weighs in: president of the National Urban League, Marc Morial; former White House adviser Anita Dunn; a man often credited with helping to spark the tea party movement, CNBC's Rick Santelli; New York Times columnist David Brooks; and Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne."
12,"Announcer: From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
13,"MR. DAVID GREGORY: Good morning. A summer of anxiety over jobs, the economy, and government borrowing as new polling this week shows President Obama's job approval rating, handling the nation's economy, at a new low. On Friday I sat down with the administration's top economic official, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner."
14,"Mr. Secretary, welcome back to the program. Thank you for having us down to your office."
15,"SEC'Y TIMOTHY GEITHNER: Good to see you, David."
16,"MR. GREGORY: I want to ask you about some of the broader economic outlooks that we've heard across the, the spectrum this week, an important one from the Fed chairman, Bernanke, who said this week the outlook is ""unusually uncertain."" And I wonder if, to you, to the
president, that means you fear that things are going to get worse before they get better?"
17,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: I don't think there's anything unusual about the fact that given the severity of this crisis, this recession, given how bad it was just 18 months ago, that Americans are still living with some caution, some sense of caution about the future. I think that's natural,
unavoidable. But, you know, the economy's now been growing for almost a year, little more than a year. Private sector's creating jobs again. The economy is starting to heal again. You're seeing growth. Manufacturing, private investment have recovered. Those are encouraging signs. But we're living still with a lot of challenge still because the scars of this crisis ran so deep. And I think most Americans understand it's going to take some time to heal this."
18,"MR. GREGORY: But ""unusually uncertain."" There's the prospect of a double-dip recession. There are economists who've said you don't normally see this kind of anemic pace of recovery once a recovery begins."
19,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: I, I think I disagree slightly in the sense that, you know, remember, this was a recession caused by a set of policies that left us with a $1.3 trillion deficit when the president came into office, an economy that was falling off the cliff. Millions of Americans had
already lost their jobs. The recession was a year old at that point. And given that we've been living beyond our means as a country, Americans have been borrowing too much, and you had a huge growth in risk taking and leverage in the financial system, what you would expect is a more moderate pace for recovery than is typical. And that's what we're seeing. But again, you are seeing a recovery. You're seeing private investment expand again, job growth starting to come back, and that's very encouraging. And if you look at what private forecasters say about the economy, they see an economy that's going to continue to grow, strengthen
moderately over the next 18 months or so. And I talked to businesses across the country, and I would say that is the general view, an economy that is gradually getting better."
20,"MR. GREGORY: So just to be precise, you do not believe in a double-dip recession, that it will get worse before it gets better?"
21,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: No, I don't. I think the most likely thing is, you see an economy that gradually strengthens over the next year or two, you see job growth start to come back again. Again, investments expanding, manufacturing's getting a little stronger, export's better. Those are very encouraging signs. But we got a long way to go still."
22,"MR. GREGORY: You see this magazine I have, The Week, and, and the headline is ""Where are the jobs? The recession is over, but no one is hiring."" Why is particularly private sector hiring apparently so slow? "
23,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: They're--I think businesses across the country, you know, again, faced with the prospect of an economy falling off the cliff, are still cautious, still very cautious. So they've been trying to get as much productivity out of their employees as possible. They're in a very
strong financial conditions, though, and I think that's very promising, because there's a lot of pent-up demand and there's a lot of capacity still for them to step up and start to invest and hire again. But you're seeing it start. You know, we've had six months of private sector job
growth. Not as fast as we like, not as fast as we need, but I think you're going to see it, again, gradually start to get better. "
24,"MR. GREGORY: But why are, why are businesses uncertain? Is it what's happened in Europe, in Greece, and in other places? I mean, in other words, businesses are making money, they've got cash, but they don't seem to want to invest it yet."
25,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: They are. Again, most important cause, I think, is the scars caused by the depth of the crisis, what that did to confidence. You're right, though, to mention Europe. You know, when people got very worried about Europe in the spring, it did hurt confidence. You saw equity prices fall around the world, and that, that absolutely had an effect. That in--produced a little more caution. But that, I believe, is a temporary factor. Europe's moved very aggressively. And they're starting to get more confidence back in Europe that they, they have some traction on policies, and they're going to be able to put this behind them."
26,"MR. GREGORY: But you still have both the political and the economic reality of this headline: ""Where are the jobs?"" And the both political and economic reality is that most Americans, based on a variety of polling, do not believe the administration's claim that the stimulus had
made things better rather than left things largely unchanged. And the criticism is, primarily from the left, that the stimulus was never big enough to really match up to the severity of the crisis. So why not stimulate more? Why not spend more to do something to create more jobs?"
27,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: There's a lot of stimulus still in the pipeline. You saw Congress move this week to expand unemployment benefits. The Senate is about to consider a very powerful package of, of tax cuts for small businesses, help small businesses get access to credit. That's very important. And we think there's some more things Congress can do to, again, to help reinforce this recovery. But we're in a transition, David, from the extraordinary actions the government had to take to break the back of this financial crisis to a recovery led by private demand. That transition is well under way. It's going to continue, it's going to strengthen."
28,MR. GREGORY: So you're not prepared to say that more public works government spending is necessary?
29,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: Well, I--we've got a lot of challenges less--left as a country still ahead of us. We have very high rates of unemployment, very high levels of long-term unemployed. We want to make sure we're strengthening the competitiveness of American companies across
industries. And we've got some long-term fiscal problems that are going to be a challenge for us as a country. And we're going to work to fix those problems we inherited, but the best way to do that is to make sure we're growing, private investment starts to come back, private firms
start to hire again. The government can help, but we need to make this transition now to a recovery led by private investment, private..."
30,MR. GREGORY: And that's an important statement.
31,SEC'Y GEITHNER: It is.
32,"MR. GREGORY: You're saying that, indeed, government should take its foot off the accelerator of stimulus."
33,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: You know, we have already moved very aggressively to unwind and walk back the emergency measures we had to put in place in the financial sector. Those were very effective, bringing down the cost of borrowing, we brought a lot of private capital in. So that was the right thing to do then. We've dialed those back very quickly. Right now we
still think there's a good case for the government acting with targeted measures to help small businesses and help the unemployed, help states keep teachers in the classroom. Those are sensible, good steps. But we have to make this transition to a recovery led by private companies."
34,"MR. GREGORY: You talked about extending benefits to the unemployed. When the president did that back in November of last year, he trumpeted the fact that it was paid for, that it wouldn't add to the deficit. And yet the complaint from Republicans this time is no such promise here. This will add to the deficit. Why was it important then to make sure it was paid for, but not now?"
35,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: I think this is a responsible way to do it. You know, my job, David, is to help make sure we can borrow to finance the obligations that Congress gives us. And I think it's a prudent, responsible way, given the scale of the emergency, the scale of the damage still facing America, that we finance these additional support for the unemployed as well as the support for small business. We think there's a good case for doing it now. We want to do it in an overall fiscally responsible way. And, as you know, the president has proposed a series of measures that will cut our deficits in half over the next several years. That's important, too, for future growth. We're going to need to make sure we get that balance right."
36,"MR. GREGORY: But again, it was important to be paid for then, but not now?"
37,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: David, we can afford to do it this way. I'm completely confident we can. And if you look, again, at what we're paying to borrow now, we've got very low interest rates as a country, in part because people around the world and Americans have a lot of confidence in our capacity as a country to make sure we manage through these challenges."
38,"MR. GREGORY: Indeed, that's the argument that is cited by those who say that government should spend more, because the cost of borrowing right now--there's all this debate about stimulus vs. the debt. A lot of people saying government spending's out of control. But you just made the point, it doesn't cost a lot to carry the debt right now. Why not spend more to create jobs when they don't appear to be materializing from the private sector?"
39,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: It's a difficult balance. Again, we are proposing to make sure we're extending tax cuts that go to 95 percent of Americans. We extend a bunch of tax incentives to businesses to help encourage hiring, investment. We think those are sensible, affordable steps. We can, we can afford to do that now. But we have to make some choices, too, and we have
to make sure we can continue to earn confidence around the world that we're going to have the will as a country to bring these large inherited deficits down over time to a much more manageable level. "
40,"MR. GREGORY: Let me talk about the achievement of financial reform legislation that you've worked so hard on. The, the pay czar, Ken Feinberg, has been working on compensation, just issued a new report saying that, at the height of the crisis, you had some of the biggest
banks paying bonuses that were not warranted. Do you have any way to get any of that money back?"
41,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: You know, he spoke to that earlier. Congress did not give him the authority to do that. But they did give him authority he used very effectively to change how Wall Street was paying its executives, and he did an enormously important job in trying to make sure that we have in place ways to make sure these guys don't go back in the future--don't go in the future back to paying executives to take risks that could imperil the stability of the economy. He did a great job, limited authority, but he used that authority very well."
42,"MR. GREGORY: The, the issue is, are we fighting the last war in financial reform? To what extent do you look at this regime of new regulation and say, ""Well, there's still a wait-and-see aspect to this in terms of whether it could really do the job the next time, because we don't know what the next time's going to look like."""
43,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: We don't. And that, that's the basic strategy that is reflected in this bill. The best way to make sure we're protecting a financial system from future crises--we won't know the source, we won't be able to anticipate pre-empt all those crises--is to make sure the
system runs with much thicker shock absorbers, much larger cushions, financial resources against loss, much stronger capital buffers so that they can withstand the kind of shock losses you'd face in a recession like this. That's the most effective thing you can do, and this reform
bill gives the government authority it did not have to make sure the system runs with these much more conservative constraints on risk taking."
44,"MR. GREGORY: As someone's who concerned about the overall growth of the economy, the role of education, innovation, manufacturing, does it trouble you that 25 percent of our economy is the financial sector, which doesn't actually make anything besides money?"
45,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: I don't know what--how large the system's going to be in the future. You can't really tell. But what we're determined to do, and what the reforms will do is to make sure this system goes back to its core purpose of taking the savings of Americans and from investors around the world and allocating those to people with an idea, not just the
largest companies in the country, but to small businesses with an idea and a plan for growing. That's what systems have to do well. Our system, at its best, was the model for the world in doing that, and these reforms will make sure we preserve that basic strength."
46,"MR. GREGORY: A couple of questions about housing and taxes. The housing market is still in a lot of trouble. It was propped up with mortgage modification, with the, the tax benefits of buying new home. That's now gone. Home sales have gone back down. Modifications have not worked, there still--has not met the goal of avoiding four million foreclosures. I'm curious to know whether the president and you are committed to three critical areas--the tax credit for mortgage interest, the credit provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the housing goals, particularly for low-income Americas--Americans. Are you still committed to those three pillars?"
47,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: I'll say the two things that guide us going forward now. One is we want to make sure that we do what is necessary to make sure Americans have the ability to borrow, to finance the purchase of a house. And we bring stability to house prices, we help repair the huge damage done by the housing market. And as you--you still say, it's still, you know, in a lot of distress. But we've brought a measure of stability to house prices, interest rates have come down dramatically, millions of Americans have been able to refinance, take advantage of lower rates, which is much more money in their pockets. And we put in place a very
carefully designed mortgage-modification program to help people who have a chance to stay in their house take advantage of that chance. Now, we're going to make sure we continue to do what's necessary to, again, repair the damage of this housing crisis. But we have to reform the system. We have to bring to Fannie and Freddie, to the GSEs, and to the broader
housing finance market a better set of policies to make sure we can deliver affordable finance for housing without leaving the economy vulnerable to this kind of crisis."
48,"MR. GREGORY: But the housing goals, because that's a big part of what Fannie and Freddie were doing, of course. Again, they, they guarantee most of the debt, the mortgage debt that's out there in the country. "
49,SEC'Y GEITHNER: They do.
50,"MR. GREGORY: And the government has now taken them over and they were private heretofore. But it is a goal of getting people into homes, is that still the goal? Because that's part of the problem, right? You had too many people in homes that couldn't afford to be there?"
51,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: David, I--we're going to take a careful look at a set of reforms that are going to be good for the country going forward and don't leave us vulnerable to this kind of crisis in the future. I personally believe that there's going to be a good case for the government
preserving some type of guarantee to make sure that people have the ability to borrow to finance a house even in a very damaging recession. I think there's going to be a good case for that."
52,MR. GREGORY: So Fannie and Freddie should not be dismantled?
53,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: No, that's, that's different."
54,MR. GREGORY: That's different.
55,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: I think we're not going to preserve Fannie and Freddie in anything like their current form. We're going to have to bring fundamental change to that market. But I think there's going to be a good case for taking a look at a preserving or putting in place a carefully
designed guarantee so, again, homeowners have the ability to borrow to finance a home even in a very difficult recession. But we're also going to have to take a look at the broad set of policies we put in place to help encourage home ownership and particularly help low-income Americans get access to affordable housing. We're going to take a very broad look
at, at, at how to best to do that. We're going to begin that process very quickly, consult broadly. And I think that there's going to be very broad support among Republicans and Democrats for a set of sensible reforms to fix this system."
56,"MR. GREGORY: Let me go through as quickly as I can some of the big tax issues. The Bush tax cuts set to expire, the administration's plan is let them expire, in other, in other words, raise taxes on wealthy Americans above 250,000, but don't let them expire, keep them going for those $250,000 or less. Even Democrats, like the chairman of the budget Committee, says bad idea to raise taxes on wealthy Americans until you've got a recovery on sounder footing. Any wiggle room on that? Any prospect of change?"
57,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: I, I, I don't, I don't think it's quite a fair description of Senator Conrad's views. But I won't speak to them. But I'll say what the president believes, and I believe this, is the right thing for the country, the fair thing, the responsible thing for the country now is to make sure we leave in place and preserve tax cuts that go to more than 95 percent of working Americans and complement those with a set of incentives for businesses to expand and hire. To make that possible, and to do that responsibly, I think it is fair and good policy
to allow those tax cuts that only go to 2 to 3 percent of the highest earners in the country to expire as scheduled. The country can withstand that. The economy can withstand that. I think it's good policy. "
58,MR. GREGORY: Would you like to see the capital gains tax stay at 20 percent?
59,SEC'Y GEITHNER: I would.
60,MR. GREGORY: And so you'll push for that?
61,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: Yeah. And, and we don't want to see the rate of dividends exceed that either because, again, we want to make sure we have policies in place overall across the economy that's going to make sure we're encouraging investment, encouraging growth as this economy recovers."
62,"MR. GREGORY: If deficits are unsustainable, can you give an example yet of a painful choice that the president's prepared to make to bring our fiscal house in order?"
63,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: Oh, absolutely. I mean, again, he's proposed to freeze discretionary spending, to keep the overall size of the government at a very modest level as a share of our economy. If you look again at what the president's proposing, he keeps the overall size of government at a very modest level comparable to--lower than what was in the Bush
administration, comparable to what President Reagan presided over. That's very important. That is a difficult thing to do when we face so many challenges as a country. But he's also proposing, as you, as you said, David, to allow these tax cuts for the highest earners to expire on schedule. He's proposed to reinstate a bunch of disciplines that helped produce the large surpluses of the Clinton era. Now--and those, those policies will bring our deficits down by more than half over the next several years."
64,"MR. GREGORY: Final question. The president talked about the fact that, like a lot of Americans who are saving for their kids educations, his 529, or college savings plan for his daughters has gone down in value. A lot of people think about..."
65,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: Well, it's come up dramatically..."
66,"MR. GREGORY: Come up--all right, but it's still..."
67,MR. GREGORY: ...from his first few months in office.
68,"MR. GREGORY: OK. Yeah, right. But this is a serious point because a lot of people think about this and about investing in the market for the future, as you've passed financial regulation. What is a fair expectation for Americans to have out of the capital markets, if they see that as a place for savings, when for so many years we've heard, ""Hey, you'll get 10 to 15 percent returns over the long-term."" Is that what Americans can really expect?"
69,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: I think what they can expect from these reforms is much more accessible, much more simple, much clearer disclosure about the terms in which they can borrow to finance education for their children, borrow to finance a home, borrow to finance a car, take a credit card. Much more clear, transparent, simple disclosure than they had over the past several decades, and much better information about the risks you take in investing. That's a sensible thing for the government to do. Now, of course, you need people to be able to make responsible decisions. We can't make those decisions for those individuals. They've got to take
that responsibility themselves."
70,MR. GREGORY: But hasn't the world fundamentally changed in the markets that you simply cannot expect to get the kind of return on investment that you've enjoyed and so many Americans have enjoyed for so many years? 
71,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: I think it's hard to know. What you want people doing is making better decisions, more careful decisions about how much of their income they spend, how much of their income they save, what they use those savings for, how much they borrow. And I think the trauma caused by this crisis is going to be profound and long-lasting, and you're already
seeing it induce, I think, an ultimately healthy and necessary change in behavior because people are already saving more of their income, and I think that's going to be a good thing for the country."
72,"MR. GREGORY: Secretary Geithner, thank you."
73,"SEC'Y GEITHNER: Nice to see you, David."
74,"MR. GREGORY: And coming up next, the rush to judge Shirley Sherrod. What happened and why? The politics of race in what many thought would be a post-racial era. Our roundtable weighs in: the National Urban League's Marc Morial; former White House adviser Anita Dunn; CNBC's Rick Santelli; David Brooks of The New York Times; and The Washington Post's E.J.
Dionne, right here only on MEET THE PRESS."
75,(Announcements)
76,"MR. GREGORY: Coming up, the fallout from the firing. What does Shirley Sherrod's dismissal tell us about race, politics and the media? After this brief commercial break."
77,(Announcements)
78,"MR. DAVID GREGORY: And we are back. Shirley Sherrod, the agriculture official wrongly accused of harboring racist views and fired based on those accusations, became an unlikely household name this week. There is plenty of blame to go around for this episode, and we will discuss that in just a moment. But one question hung in the air this week: Weren't discussions about race supposed to get better in the Obama era?"
79,"It was during the presidential campaign of 2008 that Senator Obama set an example for how to discuss race. He had to explain controversial remarks his former pastor, Reverend Jeremiah Wright, made from the pulpit. Obama's point: You have to put someones views in the context of their life experience."
80,(Videotape)
81,"SEN. BARACK OBAMA: Even for those blacks who did make it, questions of race and racism continue to define their worldview in fundamental ways. For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away, nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years."
82,(End videotape)
83,"MR. GREGORY: Ironically, that is exactly what Sherrod was trying to say in the speech that was edited to make her sound like a racist. Her point was that she once held prejudices but found a way to overcome them and help a white farmer in need."
84,"(Videotape, Wednesday)"
85,MS. SHIRLEY SHERROD: This whole incident helped me to feel a little more that we seem to be going backwards instead of forward in terms of race relations.
86,(End videotape)
87,MR. GREGORY: A teachable moment?
88,"(Videotape, Wednesday)"
89,"MR. ROBERT GIBBS: I think a teachable moment is a moment in which the facts change and you react to the different--those different facts. I think this is one of those moments, and I think that's what's happening. "
90,(End videotape)
91,"MR. GREGORY: Still, this was not the kind of Internet and cable news-fed spectacle the White House wanted to see, let alone be part of while it's trying to get Americans back to work and while the president was signing a major piece of financial reform legislation. And it wasn't the first time the White House has been thrown off track. One year ago, another racially charged incident, after the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., the president reacted."
92,"(Videotape, July 22, 2009)"
93,"PRES. OBAMA: I think it's fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry. Number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home."
94,(End videotape)
95,"MR. GREGORY: And then later expressed regret for a poor choice of words, he said, and for ratcheting up the controversy. Then there was a summit over a beer. What now? Change comes slowly, observers say, and only if moments like this are used to teach."
96,"FMR. REP. KWEISI MFUME (D-MD): We measure race relations in baby steps, not giant steps. And that's why it's taken us 300 years of slavery and a hundred years of Jim Crow to get beyond it and to get to where we are. "
97,"MR. GREGORY: Back in 2008, Senator Obama was humble about how his election might impact race in America, but he was adamant about one thing:"
98,"(Videotape, March 18, 2008)"
99,SEN. OBAMA: But race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now.
100,(End videotape)
101,"MR. GREGORY: And yet, if we're not ignoring it, the question is, are we talking about it in a way that anyone would think is actually constructive? I'm going to pose that question to the roundtable. Joining me now to discuss all the angles of this, as well as the entire political landscape as well, former Obama White House adviser Anita Dunn; CNBC's Rick Santelli; the National Urban League's Marc Morial; The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne; and David Brooks of The New York Times."
102,Welcome to all of you.
103,MR. MARC MORIAL: Nice to be back.
104,"MR. GREGORY: Marc Morial, this was, as, as the conversation about race always is, became emotional, politically charged, and it happened in a heartbeat. So to my question, are we better off for this experience? Are we having a constructive conversation about race in America?"
105,"MR. MORIAL: If we take the proper, positive steps coming out of this experience, we can be better off. There are three things I observed. One, don't forget that this started when Mr. Breitbart threw a firecracker in a crowded room."
106,"MR. GREGORY: This is, this is the conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart. "
107,"MR. MORIAL: He threw a firecracker in a crowded room. He yelled ""fire"" in a crowded theater and doctored a video, which caused an innocent, hard-working, responsible woman, whose story was of racial reconciliation, to be cast in a negative light. And then it began from
there. So that's certainly an important takeaway. The second important takeaway is the story of Shirley Sherrod and the Spooners, and that is a story of reconciliation. It's a story of people who came to respect each other. It's a woman who was willing to admit that she had some animus and that she worked to overcome it. And the third thing, I'd say, David, is this
week in Washington, the Urban League's going to have 10,000 people here for our centennial conference, we're going to have a constructive discussion about race and education, race and jobs, race and health care, a constructive discussion. And I'd invite people to follow that
discussion this week."
108,"MR. GREGORY: And the president will be speaking there, right?"
109,MR. MORIAL: The president will be there. Secretary Duncan will be there. We have Tim Kaine and Michael Steele. We've got business leaders. We've got a bit of a mix across the spectrum who'll be there to talk positively about the pressing issues that face the country.
110,"MR. GREGORY: Anita Dunn, you worked in the White House..."
111,MS. ANITA DUNN: Mm-hmm.
112,"MR. GREGORY: ...as an adviser on communications matters, and I want to get your response to Maureen Dowd's column in The New York Times... "
113,MS. DUNN: Ya.
114,"MR. GREGORY: ...this morning, because she's got some sharp words quoting the African-American Congressman James Clyburn of South Carolina. Put a portion of it up on the screen. ""`I don't think a single black person was consulted before Shirley Sherrod was fired - I mean, c'mon,' said Congressman Clyburn of South Carolina. ... `The president's getting hurt
real bad,' Clyburn told me. `He needs some black people around him.' He said Obama's inner circle keeps `screwing up' on race: `Some people over there are not sensitive at all about race. They really feel that the extent to which he allows himself to talk about race would tend to pigeonhole him or cost him support, when a lot of people saw his election as a way to get the' idea `behind us. I don't think people elected him to disengage on race. Just the opposite.' ... The president shouldn't give Sherrod her old job back. He should give her a new job: Director of Black Outreach."" The ""White House needs one."""
115,Those are strong words.
116,"MS. DUNN: Those are strong words, David. I think that there are a lot of people who look back at the last week and wish they had behaved very differently. I think there are plenty of people in the news media who wish that they had stopped and thought about kind of the fundamental job of journalism before they started asking for reaction to something that wasn't their--based on their original reporting. I think that the NAACP wishes that they had not moved as quickly as they did, and I don't think anybody is saying that the NAACP, you know, needs more African-Americans. And heaven knows that Tom Vilsack, who has taken responsibility and who
has said how badly he screwed up, and the White House, which knows how badly they screwed up, have moved."
117,"But I think there are a couple of things here. One is that this extraordinary screw-up happened, and it was bad. The White House and Vilsack moved quite quickly to fix it. And I think that's what people need to do when they make mistakes. I think that the broader question, though, which is, you know, how is this suddenly Barack Obama's problem?
He has written an entire book about race. In his book ""Audacity of Hope,"" he devotes an entire chapter. He made the speech in 2008. He has probably spoken more to this issue..."
118,MR. GREGORY: But there's a skittishness...
119,MS. DUNN: ...and thought more about this issue...
120,"MR. GREGORY: But what Clyburn is getting at is a skittishness about really confronting problems when they are--you know, when they spring up like this, however--whether there were screw-ups made, to deal with them head-on."
121,"MS. DUNN: Well, you know, David, it's funny to me because I think that so much of this resulted from what was kind of a false metanarrative that was developing last week. As you recall, I mean, you know, you talked about context, and the president's talked about context."
122,MR. GREGORY: Right.
123,"MS. DUNN: The cont ext for this was not just that Andrew Breitbart decided to edit--to put an edited video to make a point. He was trying to make the point that the NAACP is a racist organization. So let's start with that kind of fun, fun box here. Then, the week before that, the NAACP had had a resolution, OK, that's called on the tea party movement to expel
from its midst anybody who harbors racist sentiments."
124,MR. GREGORY: Right.
125,"MS. DUNN: The tea party movement came back and said, ""That makes the NAACP racist. They're being racist towards us."""
126,"MR. GREGORY: All right, and this is the broader context. E.J., let me..."
127,"MS. DUNN: But this is the broader context, OK?"
128,"MR. GREGORY: Right. Let me bring you into this, E.J., because you wrote in a column this week, ""Yet the Obama team was reacting to a reality: the bludgeoning of mainstream journalism into looking timorously over its right shoulder and believing that `balance' demands taking seriously whatever sludge the far right is pumping into the political waters."" What
do we take from this?"
129,"MR. E.J. DIONNE: Well, that--yeah, that's my column tomorrow in the Post. I mean, first of all, you asked right at the beginning a good question: Can we have a good discussion on race? We can't have a good discussion on race if the facts don't matter. And I think it's, it's not only that Shirley Sherrod was smeared, it was a perverse smear. Because, if you
look at that speech, what she was giving is a speech about racial reconciliation. She was saying poor blacks and poor whites have a lot in common. And this was twisted into a, an allegation, false allegation that she was somehow a black racist."
130,"Now, what's going on here? I think the traditional media are so afraid of being called liberal, God forbid they be called liberal, that they are willing to run with any kind of right-wing propaganda and treat it as news. Challenging propaganda, or not running it, or taking your time
before you run with a story, that's not liberalism, that's journalism. And I think that the right has been running this campaign for 30 years, they've had a lot of success, and we should worry about it. With the--you got to look over both shoulders, and you got to look at the facts."
131,"MR. DAVID BROOKS: There's not only a right-wing squabble media. I mean, there's a squabble culture out there. There's regular media--we were trained in one media. When I started working in Chicago, we were given a phrase: If your mother tells you she loves you, check it out. And so that's it. That--you would never run an excerpt from a speech unless you
saw the speech. That's just unthinkable."
132,MR. DIONNE: Right.
133,MS. DUNN: Mm-hmm.
134,"MR. BROOKS: So we were trained in a certain way. A different sort of media, squabble culture, has come up on the left and the right, which, which decides their--they build audience by destroying other people. They don't know anything about policy, they don't care about government, they just want that squabble."
135,MR. GREGORY: But...
136,"MR. DIONNE: But, but..."
137,"MR. BROOKS: And my rule is--I mean, for somebody, what Anita was doing..."
138,MR. GREGORY: Yeah.
139,"MR. BROOKS: ...stay away from the squabble culture. Don't get in there. And that's true for us, and I would say that's true..."
140,"MS. DUNN: OK. Well, let me just say something really quickly. That is easier said than done when the White House press secretary walks into the room and the only question people want to ask is, ""How are you going to react? What are you going to do? What are you going to do? What are you going to do?"""
141,MR. GREGORY: Right. Rick...
142,"MS. DUNN: And you have a false, a false fact, an edited speech, as, as E.J. says, that was designed to create this outcome that becomes ""the news of the day,"" OK?"
143,"MR. BROOKS: Well, then play by different rules. Maybe before firing somebody, call them up and talk to them."
144,"MR. GREGORY: Right. But, Rick..."
145,"MS. DUNN: I, I couldn't agree with you more there, OK, so."
146,"MR. GREGORY: Rick Santelli, but I want to bring you into this, as well, and--because the, the political dimension of this, you know, the NAACP making the charge against the, you know, the tea party; the tea party in some ways responding in kind by going after Sherrod. Eugene Robinson wrote this in his column, which was provocative: ""With the Obama presidency has come a flurry of charges - from the likes of [Andrew] Breitbart but also from more substantial conservative figures--about alleged incidences of racial discrimination against whites by blacks and other minorities. ..."
147,"""These allegations of anti-white racism are being deliberately hyped and exaggerated because they are designed to make whites fearful. It won't work with most people, of course, but it works with some - enough, perhaps, to help erode Obama's political standing and damage his party's prospects at the polls."" That this is a political strategy."
148,"MR. RICK SANTELLI: First of all, we should have zero tolerance for racial Discrimination.  Period. Beyond that, if the indirect question is, ""Is the tea party racist?"" I think the real question is, ""Are there racists in the tea party?"" And I would contend that statistically there's going to
be racists in any group. I think the tea party is more a thought, more a feeling, more a philosophy than it is a party. And I think in February of '09, when I was the lightning rod for this movement in many ways, many different, diverse groups of people from all walks of life, all races, all from different areas of the socioeconomic spectrum, all intersect in
an area that's philosophical. And I think the issue is fiscal responsibility. But with that there's a less spending issue. Less spending affects entitlements. And if you connect the dots, ultimately what we are--the, the tea party seems to represent is a movement that we
can control spending and we can have good strategies without negatively impacting minorities, which might be a higher proportion of some of these programs, again, affected by spending."
149,"MR. GREGORY: Marc Morial, I want to bring you in. Back to this question of what James--Congressman Clyburn is saying, which is that there is a, a, an unwillingness by this administration and this president to engage on matters of race because of a kind of skittishness, not wanting to get too close to it."
150,MR. MORIAL: Let me...
151,MR. GREGORY: Is that fair?
152,MR. MORIAL: I think there's two things.
153,"MR. GREGORY: Because the president said, you heard him in 2008, we must--we can't ignore it."
154,"MR. MORIAL: The president would benefit by a broad circle of external advisers, and maybe some internal advisers, who have the experience, particularly in the South, the contemporary experience of the civil rights movement, that could serve as a sounding board. And I think that
this president would benefit and every president would benefit by having those type of people, those experiences, in his circle of advisers."
155,"The second thing I just want to say is to what Rick said, what I saw from the tea party, and this is what many of us reacted to, were the aspersions on Congressman Lewis, the aspersions on Congressman Clyburn, the awful billboard, certainly repudiated now, which compared the
president of the United States, the elected leader of this great democracy, with two of the worst figures in 20th century history, Adolf Hitler and Lenin."
156,MR. GREGORY: Right.
157,"MR. MORIAL: And I asked myself, though, would I ever have seen a President Bush, a President Clinton, a President Nixon ever portrayed in that fashion? So sometimes what people react to is not what's stated... "
158,MR. GREGORY: Right.
159,MR. MORIAL: ...but they also react to what they see.
160,"MR. GREGORY: But, but, E.J., you made the point in a column, you said, ""Look, I mean, there, there's extremists on the left. I mean, there are, there are movements that have people who go way beyond the pale on both the left and the right."""
161,"MR. DIONNE: I--actually, what--the point I made in that column was that going back in the 1960s..."
162,MS. DUNN: Right.
163,"MR. DIONNE: ...to the 1960s, when folks were burning flags, mainstream liberals were asked to repudiate flag burning and they did."
164,MS. DUNN: Mm-hmm.
165,MR. GREGORY: Mm-hmm.
166,MR. DIONNE: And the NAACP did not say...
167,MS. DUNN: Right.
168,MR. DIONNE: ...that the tea party is racist. They made a very careful statement where they were saying that there is racism in the tea party and it ought to be repudiated.
169,"MR. SANTELLI: There's racism in the tea party, the Democratic Party, the Republican Party."
170,"MR. DIONNE: No, but, but--no, this is..."
171,"MS. DUNN: And, and..."
172,MR. DIONNE: ...moral equivalence. This is not the case.
173,MS. DUNN: No.
174,"MR. DIONNE: Look, there is a concerted conservative campaign on part of the movement, a minority of the movement..."
175,MS. DUNN: Right.
176,"MR. DIONNE: ...to use race to split people. Glenn Beck says Obama has a ""deep-seated hatred for white people."" J. Christian Adams, a Republican activist pushing this new Black Panthers story, says the Obama Justice Department is motivated by a ""lawless hostility toward equal enforcement of the law."" Now, there are people playing with this racial politics out there. I am not saying, the NAACP certainly isn't saying that this is the whole conservative movement..."
177,MS. DUNN: Right.
178,"MR. DIONNE: ...or most of the conservative movement or most of the tea party. But it's a part of this strategy, and people should condemn it. "
179,MR. SANTELLI: But the...
180,"MR. BROOKS: There are liberals who call conservatives racist as a matter of tactics, too. That happens as well. Listen, I was out jogging. You wouldn't know it to look at me. I was out jogging in the mall. I was at a tea party rally, tea party rally. Also there was a group called the
back--Black Family Reunion, celebration of African-American culture. I watched these two groups intermingle, sitting at the same table, eating, watching concerts together. Among most of those people there was a fantastic atmosphere of just getting along on a, on a warm Sunday afternoon. And so there are people. But I was struck by a story of
progress, a story of progress, that we're making some progress to this. And this whole week--that speech was about progress. We now have a gotcha culture that punishes people that say terrible things. So I think overall it's slow, steady progress."
181,"MR. GREGORY: But can I, can I add into the mix here, in this week of this emotionally-charged discussion, came Senator Jim Webb, a Democrat, Virginia, who wrote an op-ed piece that raised a lot of eyebrows. We'll put the headline on the screen: ""Diversity and the Myth of White Privilege,"" the subhead, ""America still owes a debt to its black citizens, but government programs to help all `people of color' are unfair. They should end."""
182,"Anita Dunn, I mean there are those even in the Democratic Party who are saying, ""Look, we have to have a real conversation about these issues."" "
183,"MS. DUNN: And I don't think there's anybody who's saying we shouldn't have a real conversation about these issues, but I also don't think there's anybody at this table or, frankly, most people in America, who think that an edited, two-and-a-half-minute clip that begins driving the news, that has reporters saying, ""How's the White House going to react? It's a huge problem. It's a huge problem. Are they going to fire her? What are they going to do? What are they going to do?"" That's not a reasoned conversation. I think a reasoned conversation is exactly what the president has tried to promote throughout his career and that he has said we need to have. But let's not mistake what's been going on over the past week for any kind of reasoned conversation. There was the rush to judgment on Shirley Sherrod, and now there's a new metanarrative, I think, based on another false premise, the idea that somehow Barack Obama is the problem with race relations in America or the reason we don't have
a conversation. I don't think that's true either."
184,"MR. MORIAL: But, you know, David, I want to say this."
185,MS. DUNN: Yeah.
186,"MR. MORIAL: One of the things this distracts from is the news of the week that the Senate cut out $1 billion for summer jobs, but is prepared to spend $60 billion on a troop surge if--in Afghanistan. One of the things this distracts from has been the repeated use of the filibuster to block legislation and block measures that would help the economy in urban communities, and that, to me..."
187,MR. GREGORY: Let me...
188,MR. SANTELLI: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
189,"MR. MORIAL: ...that, to me, and the persistent use of the filibuster, it being used more times in the last two years than in the previous century..."
190,MR. GREGORY: All right. 
191,MR. MORIAL: ...to stop this legislation greatly concerns me.
192,"MR. GREGORY: Quick, quick, Rick. Great. Hold the thought, though. I want to get your reaction to Jim Webb's point in his editorial."
193,"MR. MORIAL: I don't agree that Latinos and Asians have not suffered discrimination in this country or that Native Americans have not suffered discrimination in this country. I think the question is, how do you target and tailor policies that are going to help all economically and
socially disadvantaged people. And it's a fair debate to have, but it also needs to be positive with facts. Look at the Latino unemployment rate. It's higher than the white rate. The black rate is higher than the Latino rate. So to suggest that there are not disparities that affect the
Latino community, that affect the Native American community, most in depth, the African-American community, we've got to have the discussion that Jim Webb wants to have. With facts, real facts, that give a picture of how life is in this nation."
194,"MR. GREGORY: All right. Rick, make your point, then I want to take a break."
195,"MR. SANTELLI: Forty-one cents of every dollar this government spends in fiscal 2010 goes to pay debt. It's borrowed money. Forty-one cents of every dollar. Marcus, we have a $3.5 trillion 2010 budget. Let's look at that $34 billion for extension. These people need help, but to think
that this administration--and in Timothy Geithner's interview, he talks about getting their fiscal house in order. In a $3.5 trillion budget, they can't come up with a way to offset $34 billion in spending. It isn't that the conservatives want to be mean-spirited. It's that at the
end-game, if the country is broke, everybody loses."
196,"MR. GREGORY: All right. We're going to take a break here. We will pick up talking more about the Geithner interview, the economy and politics in our remaining moments with our roundtable--do 't go away--right after this brief station break."
197,(Announcements)
198,"MR. GREGORY: We're back with our roundtable. So much to get to and, frankly, not enough time. But Santelli's taking over your role. He's setting up the next topic beautifully, that segue artist that E.J. normally is. I want to talk about the economy and, and some of what
Secretary Geithner said that I thought was, was pretty striking. But first, let me show you a couple of things. A poll from Bloomberg just about a week ago asking, ""Are you better off than you were 18 months ago?"" Look at that, 17 percent say yes; worse off, 29 percent; or about
the same, 54 percent. That's after the stimulus plan."
199,"Ron Brownstein, in his column in the National Journal, says this in the political context: ""Polls suggest that an energized core of voters - possibly around 40 percent - has ideologically recoiled from Obama's direction. That threatens Democrats, but their greater problem is that
voters open to an activist government in principle are not convinced that it's producing enough benefits in practice,"" David Brooks. Government has not proven to be the answer, and yet that's the fundamental argument from the administration."
200,"MR. BROOKS: Right. There's been a, there's been a massive recall in the past year. The Obama administration has dropped about 20 percent among independent voters, in part because of the debt and other issues. But faith in government has plummeted back to its historic lows. Faith in
Congress this week hit an 11 percent, an historic low forever. So how do you persuade people that you can do things when you have that kind of distrust, and that hasn't been solved? The stimulus obviously created some jobs. But the fact is, it's taken forever to get out; and the
underlying reality is, the more the debt goes up, the more people are scared, and the more they're scared, especially small business, they're just not investing."
201,"MR. GREGORY: But, Rick Santelli, this is, again, and the liberal argument, which I brought up to Secretary Geithner, is, to challenge your point of view, ""Hey, wait a minute, you're raising the red flag about debt. Yes, they're unsustainable. But the cost of borrowing money right
now is so low that, when you're in this kind of exigent circumstance economically, why not measure spending commensurate with the size of the, the financial hole we're in?"""
202,"MR. SANTELLI: Let's cover three areas on that. First of all, when people get addicted to bad substances, usually the people that supply it give them really good prices in the early days. I don't think it's a great idea that we are enamored with the fact that we can sell so much debt,
because it could all change very quickly. At the end of last year, a Greek six-month bond was around 2 percent. It's more than doubled, and it's only seven months into the year."
203,MR. GREGORY: We're not Greece; we can print money.
204,"MR. SANTELLI: We're not Greece yet, but that could be the ghost of the economy of the future if we stay on this unsustainable path. The other thing is, there's some of us out there that don't believe the stimulus or the recovery package or the TARP did what it sold. Matter of fact, my opinion would be that what we've done is we've created a six-day cure for a three-day flu."
205,"MR. GREGORY: The issue of taxes, Anita Dunn, is front page on the morning papers today in The Post and The Times. The Washington Post front page: ""Battle looms on tax breaks"" as the Bush-era cuts are at issue. The New York Times, ""Next big battle in Washington: Bush's tax cuts."" If the administration is serious about cutting the deficit, why keep any of these tax cuts going? Because extending tax cuts to the middle class, those $250,000--$100,000 or less, is going to cost about $250 billion to do next year."
206,"MS. DUNN: David, the president was very clear, as a candidate in 2008, as president in 2009 and 2010, which is he believes that the middle class of this country pays enough in taxes and should not have a tax increase. He believes that they're stressed enough and that they're--and that they lost ground over the last decade, and that he's not going to raise taxes on them."
207,MR. GREGORY: But let me just stop you...
208,"MS. DUNN: He was very clear. But, no, but..."
209,"MR. GREGORY: Hold on, I want to stop you..."
210,MS. DUNN: Yeah.
211,MR. GREGORY: ...on this issue of tough choices because I pressed the...
212,"MS. DUNN: Right, uh-huh."
213,MR. GREGORY: ...Republicans on this. It is tough to say to the American people...
214,MS. DUNN: Yes.
215,"MR. GREGORY: ...""I know you pay too much, but I can't do it now if I want to be serious about the deficit. Why not say to the American people, ""You got to sacrifice. We got to get rid of all these tax cuts if, if it's a bad idea,"" which is what Democrats believe, that the tax cuts were a bad idea."
216,"MS. DUNN: No, Democrats didn't believe all of those tax cuts were a bad idea. As a matter of fact, David, there were battles in 2001 and 2003 from Democrats to do things like double the Child Care Tax Credit to make the tax cuts more progressive at the bottom end. So they didn't believe all of those tax cuts were a bad idea either in 2001 or in 2003. What they did believe, and what they continue to believe, is that the, is that the very, very highest, and then the people who did the best, the 2 percent, 2 percent of the 300 million people in this country, that they can pay a little more during this time. But in terms of the deficit piece of this, the president is absolutely convinced and is taking steps. There is a bipartisan deficit commission--and I know in Washington bipartisan commissions come and go--but this is a very serious effort, and it will come back with recommendations, and there are going to be tough choices
in there. The president's already directed his Cabinet agencies to cut their spending. There are going to be tough choices in there, and there have to be, because I think everyone recognizes that."
217,"MR. GREGORY: I've got about three minutes left. E.J., you can weigh in on that, but I want to show--the president spoke to the Netroots Conference over the weekend. So this is a developing story about the Obama agenda and some of the complaints from the left, and I just want to play a portion of that."
218,"(Videotape, Saturday)"
219,"PRES. OBAMA: So, in ways large and small, we've begun to deliver on the change you fought so hard for. And we're not done. We're working to repeal ""Don't ask, Don't tell."" We're working to close Guantanamo in a responsible way. And thanks to the heroism of our troops, we are poised to end our combat mission in Iraq by the end of August, completing a draw-down of more than 90,000 troops since I took office. We're moving America forward. And when we've come this far, we can't afford to slide backward."
220,(End videotape)
221,"MR. GREGORY: What's striking about that is that the president has a problem with independent voters, but he's also got those on the left who are pretty disappointed."
222,"MR. DIONNE: Right now you think that's important to the outcome of the election. I just want to say one thing on this tax issue. Warren Buffett very famously said that he pays tax at a lower rate than his receptionist. Because of the way we tax dividends and capital gains, the
truly rich people in the country, according to a study last year, the 400 richest people, pay taxes at a lower rate, in effect, than firefighters, than police officers, than shop clerks. That's why we need to raise taxes on the very wealthy to cover the deficit. Because, guess what, the tax increases on the wealthy do not have an anti-stimulative effect the way tax cuts on average people do. Barack Obama was very smart to do that. He needed to do that. They're--the Democrats are going to be in trouble if their own people don't turn out. Right now, Rick Santelli's tea party has really motivated a lot of people on the right. The administration and Democrats have to do a lot more motivating on their side."
223,"MR. GREGORY: Let, let me get your thoughts about fiscal responsibility, but save me 30 seconds to talk about Charlie Rangel, OK?"
224,"MR. BROOKS: Oh I--Warren Buffett pays cap gains rates, which they're not going to raise. They're raising the rates as income tax rates. That doesn't matter. Listen, my view of the--of fiscal policy and the economy is just not that strong. We've learned you can pump a lot of the money, you're not going to get short-term buzz. You should think long-term. What
can we do long-term to get fair taxes, simple taxes, structure and innovation? So I, I think the idea we're going to fix the economy or fiscal policy in the next six months or a year, it's fallacious. "
225,"MR. GREGORY: Marc Morial, can, can Charlie Rangel survive the ethics trouble he's in?"
226,"MR. MORIAL: Last time I walked through the streets of Harlem, Charlie Rangel still has incredible support, and I think what this week tells us is, let's not pre-judge Charlie Rangel. Charlie Rangel has a right to be heard, and I think we need to hear his side of the story. He's a great congressman, he's a great American."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, the growing disaster in the Gulf.  Much more oil than anyone thought spewing from BP's out of control well, and a lot of anger for President Obama to manage.  Has the government done enough to hold BP accountable?  And even as the president confronts problems like a jobless economic recovery and Iran's dangerous drive
toward nuclear weapons, what toll has the oil disaster taken on the Obama presidency?  With us exclusively this morning to talk about it all, the president's senior adviser, David Axelrod.

7,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Day 55 of the oil spill in the Gulf, and news this weekend that the White House has now told BP it must devise a more aggressive strategy for collecting the oil, and the deadline for that plan is today. Also, the president speaking yesterday on the phone to the
new British prime minister, David Cameron, assuring him that the criticism of BP is not aimed at our allies in Great Britain.  Joining us live this morning to discuss it all, the president's senior adviser, David Axelrod."
8,Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
9,"MR. DAVID AXELROD:  Thanks, David.  Good to be here."
10,"MR. GREGORY:  In addition to speaking to David Cameron, the president wants to speak more directly to the American people.  Tell us about that. "
11,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, the president's going down to the Gulf on Monday and Tuesday to the states that he hasn't visited--Alabama, Mississippi and Florida--and when he returns, he's going to address the nation from the White House.  We're at a kind of inflection point in this saga because we now know that what--essentially what we can do and what we can't do in
terms of collecting oil and, and what lies ahead in the next few months, and he wants to lay out the steps that we're going to take from here to get through this, through this crisis."
12,"MR. GREGORY:  It's a big step, presumably an Oval Office address to the nation.  Why does the president think this is necessary now, and what does he want to say, what does he want to lay out for the American people?"
13,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, look, there's an awful lot of interest in this, obviously, and there are a lot of people who are, who are suffering in the Gulf, a lot of concern about what the future holds.  And we have some clarity now about, about the oil that's escaping, and about how we're
going to approach it, and about what this means for those communities. And we want to talk about that, and talk about the steps that we're going to take to deal with it."
14,"MR. GREGORY:  You--you're trying to plug the hole on one hand; on the other hand, trying to deliver some aid for the Gulf.  Will this be part of an effort by the president to announce something of an aid package for the Gulf region..."
15,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, the..."
16,MR. GREGORY:  ...to help those who are affected?
17,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, the president will announce several steps.  But, as you know, we're meeting--president is meeting and, and, and his top aides are meeting with the, the BP officials on, on Wednesday, and there he's going to be very clear about what our expectations are in terms of taking care of the people who've been damaged by this crisis."
18,"MR. GREGORY:  And, and unpack that a little bit, David, because there, there is an effort there to make sure claims are paid."
19,MR. AXELROD:  Yes.
20,MR. GREGORY:  And how would he like to see that happen?
21,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, we want to make sure that money is escrowed for the, the legitimate claims that are going to be made and are being made by businesses down in the Gulf, people who've been damaged by this.  And, and we want to make sure that that money is independently administered so that there won't be slow-walk on these claims.  There are people there who live from pay--from week to week and whose livelihoods have been,
have been taken away from them here, and we want to make sure that they can get through this. "
22,"MR. GREGORY:  On the aid question, though, will there be an announcement by the president for some kind of direct assistance for those who are affected?"
23,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, David, I think that the assistance is going to come from BP.  They're responsible for it.  We want to make sure that they meet that responsibility, and that's going to be made very clear to them. It's been made clear to them throughout.  But we want to set up a structure and, and, and, and protect the integrity of that fund so that people get what they're due."
24,"MR. GREGORY:  This conversation the president had with David Cameron, the British prime minister, are they in sync about the approach?  Because Cameron's been concerned about some of the, the hard pushback against BP. Evidently he said to the president, ""Look, we've got to have a strong and stable BP, a prosperous BP, if they're going to be able to make this
right."" Were they in sync, or were there some disagreement? "
25,"MR. AXELROD:  Look, the president's made clear that, as regards to shareholders, for example, that BP has its legal obligations and they ought to meet them.  But they also have legal and moral obligations to people in the Gulf for this horrendous disaster.  And, and we're going to make sure that they meet them.  We're not interested in undermining the integrity of, of their, of their company, but it--this, this disaster has had an impact on their company, and that's of their own making."
26,"MR. GREGORY:  But in order to meet those claims, does the president still believe it's important that BP remain stable and profitable? "
27,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, we believe that BP has the resources to meet the claims, and we're going to make sure that they do.  They're a highly profitable company.  They've got lots of assets.  They have the prospect of continuing. But, but they have to meet their obligations here."
28,MR. GREGORY:  What are we looking at in terms of a money...
29,MR. AXELROD:  I'm not going to...
30,MR. GREGORY:  ...a figure for the claims?
31,"MR. AXELROD:  I'm not going to--that's a--that will be the discussion between, between us and BP.  But it has to be substantial enough to meet the claims that we expect to come."
32,"MR. GREGORY:  Will the CEO, Tony Hayward, of BP be part of this meeting at the White House this week?"
33,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, the president invited the chairman of the board of BP to bring whomever he wants.  If he brings Mr. Hayward, then Mr. Hayward will be there."
34,"MR. GREGORY:  Why--this, this question has come up about why the president doesn't talk directly to Tony Hayward, and he told Matt Lauer this week, you know, ""I don't like dealing with people who are going to tell me what they think I want to hear."" But that struck me as odd because the president certainly didn't hesitate to meet with all those bank CEOs when he wanted to get something done.  This is the guy who runs the operation."
35,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, let me make clear that Mr. Hayward knows exactly what our, what our demands have been from the beginning.  And..."
36,"MR. GREGORY:  But what's the difference with the bank CEOs?  Because they understood what the demands were from the administration, too, but the president got the bank CEOs themselves in the room."
37,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, he got them in a room as an industry, and he's talked to the oil industry and other industries as well.  But in this particular matter we've had--our intermediaries have been very clear, there's no doubt in the mind of BP what our, what our demands are and have been."
38,"MR. GREGORY:  Speaking about Tony Hayward, he's got an ad that BP is paying for to try to rehabilitate its image, and he's front and center in that ad. And I want to just play a portion of it for you..."
39,MR. AXELROD:  Mm-hmm.
40,MR. GREGORY:  ...and have you react to it.
41,(Videotape from BP TV commercial)
42,"MR. TONY HAYWARD:  To those affected in your families, I'm deeply sorry. The Gulf is home for thousands of BP employees, and we all feel the impact.  To all the volunteers and for the strong support of the government, thank you. We know it is our responsibility to keep you 
informed and do everything we can so this never happens again.  We will get this done.  We will make this right."
43,(End videotape)
44,"MR. GREGORY:  You were quoted this week saying this isn't a very sympathetic figure, Tony Hayward."
45,MR. AXELROD:  Yes.
46,MR. GREGORY:  Does the president trust this guy?
47,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, look, it's not a matter of who--we, we--it's not a matter of trust.  We have to verify what they're doing, we have to stay on them, and we have from the beginning.  That's why we want this escrow account.  I'm not here to, to make judgments about any individual's character, but we do know that they have pecuniary interests that may be in conflict with, with the interests of, of our interests, and we..."
48,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but let--but..."
49,MR. AXELROD:  ...need to make sure that the interests of people in the Gulf are protected.  That is what our job is.
50,"MR. GREGORY:  But this is a straightforward question.  If you are in partnership with somebody--and make no mistake, the government is in partnership with BP to get this problem solved--does the, does the president of the United States trust the man on the other end who is leading this operation?"
51,"MR. AXELROD:  Our, our mission here is to hold them accountable in, in every appropriate way, and that is what we're going to do.  I, I'm not--I don't consider them a, a, a partner, I don't consider them--they're not social friends, they're not--I'm not looking to make judgments about their soul.  I just want to make sure that they do what they're required to do."
52,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you trust them to get the job done?  Yes, no or maybe?"
53,MR. AXELROD:  We're going to make sure they get the job done.
54,MR. GREGORY:  But it doesn't sound like there's a lot of faith there at the moment. 
55,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, our job is to hold them accountable, David, and that's what we're going to do."
56,"MR. GREGORY:  Speaking about accountability, I, I mention Matt Lauer and his interview with the president on ""Today"" this week, and they had an exchange that raised a lot of eyebrows in terms of the president's approach to all of this.  I want to play a portion of it."
57,"(Videotape from ""Today,"" Tuesday)"
58,"MR. MATT LAUER:  ...that this is not the time to meet with experts and advisers, this is a time to spend more time in the Gulf and, I never thought I'd say this to a president, but kick some butt.  And, and, and I don't mean it to be funny."
59,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  I don't sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar.  We talk to these folks because they potentially had the best answers so I know whose ass to kick, right?  So, you know, this is not theater."
60,(End videotape)
61,MR. GREGORY:  So whose butt has he kicked since he gave that interview?
62,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, look, I think from the beginning we've made demands on BP.  They have responded.  Where they haven't responded, we've turned up the heat on them.  Let me give you an example.  They wanted to drill one relief well, which is ultimately the answer to, to shutting down that well completely.  We said, ""No, you're going to drill two,"" because if one didn't work we want to make sure there was a back, a backstop.  We've asked for other redundancies in terms of, of what they're doing there. And understand, when the president says he's talking to experts, we've assembled under the, under the chairmanship of our secretary of energy a group of, of the best minds in and out of government, and they've been
guiding a lot of what's happened a lot--this effort to capture the oil is largely working better now because of theories that were developed by this outside group.  And we forced BP to do the things that we felt were necessary just--we now, we now--Dr. Chu and his group have devised a plan to get more oil up and captured and, and it will require more boats. We've required them to bring more tankers in to take that oil up quickly. So we've been on them from the beginning, and we're going to stay on them and make sure that they're fully accountable and that they do everything that they're required to do."
63,"MR. GREGORY:  How much pressure has the president felt, have you felt for, frankly, the president to make up for lost time in terms of showing leadership on this, projecting a sense of compassion and connection with those who are involved.  I mean, you have the president ramping up his own rhetoric and his own anger level..."
64,MR. AXELROD:  Well...
65,MR. GREGORY:  ...and you have the decision to make an address...
66,"MR. AXELROD:  ...in fairness in that, in that particular interview, David, he was responding to Matt's characterization, but go ahead and continue."
67,"MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.  Right.  How much pressure do you think the, the president feels to connect on this?"
68,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, let me tell you something.  You know what pressure is? He--we've been down in the Gulf several times.  I was with him on the last trip.  Pressure are--is what those fishermen are feeling down there who--whose livelihoods have been destroyed by this.  People have been there for five generations.  Not just their livelihood, but their way of life being threatened by this.  The people down there are the ones who are under, under pressure.  I know there's a great deal of speculation in this town about the political implications and the state, statecraft of all of this, but we've been--the president on day one understood how
massive this could be and mobilized the greatest response to an environmental disaster in the history of this country.  He went down there and stood, I remember, on--shortly after the incident, in the pouring rain on a Sunday morning and, and, and spoke to the need to hold
BP accountable..."
69,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But, David, but there's..."
70,MR. AXELROD:  ...and to help people in that area.
71,"MR. GREGORY:  ...there, there's a tendency to write everything off as just a Washington obsession, but here's a poll from a Washington Post/ABC News poll about the public's response to how people are doing, and the results were not so good.  Sixty-nine percent say the a negative response from the federal government, only outpaced by BP itself.  Even a member
of the president's own party, Mary Landrieu, saying, ""I just think the president underestimated how important it is for people to see his face and to hear his voice."" The sense that the response has just been late in coming and has not been what it should be."
72,"MR. AXELROD:  Yeah, well, let me, let me say this.  This is not a like a hurricane, it's not like a tornado, it's not like a plane crash.  This is an ongoing crisis much like an epidemic, and it's--and there are millions of, of, of, of gallons of oil that have poured into the Gulf and continue
to--that are threatening the coastlines.  We've got--we've put 26,000 personnel on the ground, we've put down five million feet of boom, we've mobilized 5,500 vessels into the Gulf to deal with this.  We've 200 burns of oil.  We've collected a millions--we've collected much oil from the surface.  But it is still threatening the coastline, and no one's going to be satisfied with that. Understand no one is going to be satisfied until this comes to an end, until we remediate the damage, until we restore the coastline to its, to its natural state.  And that is our goal.  But this is not--it's not an easy thing to deal with for the people down there, and it's not going to be satisfying until it's over."
73,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to ask about some other topic, including the economy."
74,MR. AXELROD:  Mm-hmm.
75,"MR. GREGORY:  This is the Washington Post headline today.  ""Obama Pleads for Aid Package, $50 Billion for States and Localities."" As you think about the economy at large, does the president believe that more stimulus is necessary?"
76,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, I think that we've made great progress, David, in the sense that when he took office, the day he walked in the door, we were losing 750,00 jobs a month, we were losing 6.4 percent in our economy. We--in other words we were shrinking and not growing.  Now the economy is growing, now in the last three months we've averaged 140,000 jobs a month.  But it's clear we're not out of the woods and we have to keep working at this; and that, and that's certainly the prospect--the state governments are lagging behind.  The prospect that hundreds of thousands of school teachers, for example, are going to be laid off because of
this..."
77,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, but I'm trying to be..."
78,MR. AXELROD:  ...crisis is...
79,MR. GREGORY:  Be clear.  Is the president now asking for more direct aid from Congress for states and localities that are in terrible trouble financially?
80,MR. AXELROD:  The president has reiterating the support that he--reiterating the steps that he's already supported. 
81,MR. GREGORY:  Additional aid is necessary?
82,"MR. AXELROD:  In addition, in addition to that--no, he's repeating--he's reiterating the steps that he thought that we should be taking now in, in--as we transition out of this crisis.  One of the important ones that you didn't mention is help for small businesses.  We want a zero capital gains tax for small businesses, we want to create the opportunity for small businesses to get loans, which has been a problem for them through this crisis.  We have to continue to take steps because, yes, we've made progress, but we lost eight and a half million jobs during that recession.  People are suffering out there.  We want to keep this economy growing faster.  We want to see an acceleration in job creation, and we have to take some steps to continue in that direction."
83,"MR. GREGORY:  Because you had, you had private sector job growth of 41,000 jobs last month, that was all.  You have companies that are hoarding cash, not spending it in the private sector.  You have consumers who are cutting down on their retail spending.  And there's a lot of critics who say, ""Yeah, there have been, there's been some sign of recovery, but it's really anemic if you have the private sector holding back."" It's something of a government-infused phony recovery."
84,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, David, you and I both know that there have been intervening events such as the crisis in Greece and the European currency situation.  So that has had an impact on confidence as well.  We were in a pretty good skein there.  But there are mixed signals. On Friday the Consumer Confidence Index was up to a two-year high.  I mean, there are, there are mixed signals..."
85,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
86,"MR. AXELROD:  ...and that's what generally happens in recovery.  But we don't take anything for granted.  We have to keep pushing forward, and we should not be careless about pulling out of our, out of our stimulative effort too quickly.  That, that mistake was made in Japan in the '90s, and..."
87,MR. GREGORY:  So to that point...
88,MR. AXELROD:  ...and they had a decade of deflation.  That was--mistake was made in the '30s in the United States.  We're not going to make the same mistake.
89,MR. GREGORY:  So you're not--and you're not going to rule out additional stimulus if that's what the economy requires.
90,"MR. AXELROD:  We--well, the president has recommended the steps that he thinks Congress should take now.  We also have more--many of the Recovery Act projects around the country are taking hold this summer, by design, that will involve a lot of private industry construction and so on.  So the combination of those things will help, and we hope the Congress will act expeditiously to get that done."
91,"MR. GREGORY:  A couple of other matters I want to get to, including politics, your bailiwick.  What did Tuesday mean, this primary result? What's going on in this decision here?"
92,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, you know, I think it's interesting because there's a lot of conventional wisdom around about what this year is.  I think that it's, it's hard to fully interpret because you get mixed results.  I think, you know, a lot of people thought Blanche Lincoln would lose, the
senator from Arkansas, in her primary.  She won that primary, and what it underscores to me is that good candidates running good campaigns, well-conceived campaigns, making the case for their advocacy for people in their states, in their districts are going to win.  We saw that in
Pennsylvania 12, that special election of--congressional election where a Republican was expected to win, the Democrat won."
93,"The other interesting thing about this primary is that the Republican Party continues its march right where you saw in Nevada, another tea party candidate winning the nomination.  And I don't think most Republicans and most Americans believe as she does that we should abolish
the Department of Education, abolish the Department of Energy.  That we should privatize Social Security. But this is the drift of the Republican Party, and I think it's going to make for a very interesting November."
94,"MR. GREGORY:  What is the president's plan for November in terms of how he'll campaign, who he'll campaign for?  The record's been spotty in terms of presidential direct involvement in some of these races so far. "
95,"MR. AXELROD:  The president--well, the president, he did a couple of events for members of the House last week when he was in Michigan.  But understand, we are mounting a very large-scale effort, $50 million effort through the Democratic National Committee, something that's never been done before.  We're focusing a lot on those first-time voters who were so important in 2008.  And the president will be out and campaigning and making the case.  He believes strongly that, that Democrats in Congress have stood up and cast courageous votes, fought for the middle class against special interests..."
96,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
97,"MR. AXELROD:  ...on credit card reform, on student loan reform, on a series of things that can make a difference in the lives of the people. "
98,"MR. GREGORY:  Is, is he the Democratic Party's greatest asset politically?"
99,"MR. AXELROD:  I think he--yeah, well, I think he is.  I mean, but openly..."
100,MR. GREGORY:  You think that's a uniform view?
101,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, I don't know.  I mean, you'll have to poll people, and we'll go where we're asked.  But I, I--but we're being asked to do quite a few things, and I expect that will be so.  But here's the, here's the--what I believe.  I believe that ultimately these races are going to
be decided at the local level at the, at the grass roots.  And the candidates who speak to the aspirations and concerns of people in their districts and states are going to win."
102,"Look, the Republican Party--everybody says, ""Is this 1994?"" In 1994, the Republican Party was nearly at 60 percent in favorability.  Today, they're at an all-time low.  Why?  Because in the last year and a half, they've sat on the sidelines, they've rooted for failure, they've
contributed nothing.  And their basic thrust seemed--and they've stood with the oil companies, the, the banks, the insurance industry, and their basic thrust seems to be ""Let's go back to what we were doing before the crisis."" That's not where the American people want to go."
103,"MR. GREGORY:  One more political question.  Alvin Greene down in South Carolina, unemployed man who was somehow elected to become the Democratic Party's Senate candidate, is he a legitimate candidate?"
104,"MR. AXELROD:  It, it doesn't appear so to me.  I mean, it was a mysterious deal.  He didn't campaign, he had no campaign..."
105,MR. GREGORY:  Had no campaign funds.
106,"MR. AXELROD:  He--yeah.  The whole thing is odd, and I, you know, and I don't really know how to explain it, and I don't think anybody else does either. And so this..."
107,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think he should just get out of the race?  Would that be wise?
108,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, I think the Democrats of South Carolina deserve a strong, credible candidate.  And he would argue, I suppose, that he won the primary, so that's--that would be him.  How he won the primary is a big mystery, though, and until you resolve that, I don't think he can claim to be a strong, credible candidate."
109,"MR. GREGORY:  A couple of foreign policy questions that I think are important.  Let's talk about Afghanistan.  Our chief foreign correspondent, Richard Engel, is embedded with the 82nd Airborne right now, and his--the unit that he was with, the 82nd, was actually under attack yesterday.  They returned from their outpost from a two-hour hike to Arghandab, which is outside of Kandahar in the Kandahar province after they were attending a memorial service.  I want to play a portion of his reporting from ""Nightly News"" last night."
110,"(Videotape from ""NBC Nightly News,"" Saturday)"
111,"MR. RICHARD ENGEL:  After the salutes and prayers, Charlie Company marches back home.  The Taliban are watching them.  They attack as soon as the troops return to their outpost.  The soldiers rush to the roof to return fire.  It's the most intense assault ever on the outpost."
112,Unidentified Soldier #1:  Get some ammo!
113,MR. ENGEL:  They launch mortars almost straight up because 20 Taliban fighters are just a hundred yards away.
114,Unidentified Soldier #2:  Watch and shoot!
115,Unidentified Soldier #3:  Watch and shoot!
116,"MR. ENGEL:  But in the chaos, they're just realizing how bad it is."
117,"Unidentified Soldier #4:  And the others, how many we have?"
118,Unidentified Soldier #5:  We have two in there.
119,"MR. ENGEL:  In the guard tower on the roof, soldiers find more injured."
120,Unidentified Soldier #6:  All right.  Stay low!  Stay low!
121,"MR. ENGEL:  Now, three soldiers are wounded.  They're treated under fire and evacuated off the roof.  The troops keep firing, now supported by helicopter gunships."
122,(End videotape)
123,"MR. GREGORY:  I show you that, one, because, lest we forget, our troops are facing..."
124,MR. AXELROD:  Yes.
125,"MR. GREGORY:  ...incredible, incredible difficulties in the field..."
126,MR. AXELROD:  Yes.
127,"MR. GREGORY:  ...and are showing great valor and strength in the field.
But also..."
128,MR. AXELROD:  As is your reporter.
129,"MR. GREGORY:  As is, absolutely, Richard Engel every day.  But also in the context of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who's reported by The New York Times this weekend to have some real doubts about whether U.S. forces and NATO forces can prevail in this fight.  This is how Dexter
Filkins reported it Saturday in The New York Times:  ""According to [Amrullah] Saleh, [the former director of Afghan intelligence service] and Afghan and Western officials ... Mr. Karzai [has] lost faith in the Americans and NATO to prevail in Afghanistan."
130,"""For that reason, Mr. Saleh and other officials said, Mr. Karzai has been pressing to strike his own deal with the Taliban and the country's archrival, Pakistan, the Taliban's longtime supporter.  According to a former senior Afghan official, Mr. Karzai's maneuverings involve secret negotiations with the Taliban outside the purview of American and NATO officials."
131,"""`The president has lost confidence in the'"" ability ""`of either the coalition or his own government to protect this country,' Mr. Saleh said in an interview at his home.  `President Karzai has never announced that NATO will lose, but the way that he does--the way that he does not proudly own the campaign shows that he doesn't trust it is working.'"" How much of a concern is that?"
132,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, let me say two things.  First of all, understand what this mission is.  This mission is about al-Qaeda, about putting pressure on al-Qaeda on both sides of the border, about not letting Afghanistan become a safe harbor, a safe haven for al-Qaeda again.  In the last 16 months, we have, we have damaged al-Qaeda in a way that hasn't occurred since the beginning. Half their--of their top 20 leadership has been killed or captured because we've got cooperation on the Pakistan side of the border from Pakistan and because of our operations in Afghanistan. And, ultimately, this is about our security, and that's why we're there. As to this issue, understand that Mr. Saleh was fired by President Karzai, so, you know, that may help color some of his interpretations. And, and Mr. Karzai rejected his, his interpretation of this."
133,"At the end of the day, however, we've always said that this will involve the, the future of Afghanistan, it will involve a political solution, just as it did in Iraq.  And, ultimately, if the Taliban is willing to lay down arms and participate in a peaceful way, that that, that would be
part of the solution. Meanwhile, we are putting pressure on them every day, and that, that very difficult footage that you show is a reflection of the fact that we are in a battle with them..."
134,MR. GREGORY:  But...
135,"MR. AXELROD:  ...and we, we are taking it to them."
136,"MR. GREGORY:  But the president wants to remove troops at some point next year, in 2011, and when you have generals expressing concern that the goals may not be met by the time the president wants them met, it, it leads to the question, is that withdrawal deadline a conditional deadline or, in the president's mind, is it a hard deadline?  As he said at West Point, we have to get troops out because this cannot go on forever, regardless of what it looks like."
137,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, the president made it clear that we can't make an open-ended commitment there, that the Afghan government and the Afghan people have to take responsibility themselves, and their army, their security.  And their civil institutions have to take responsibility. We--he is committed to begin that process of withdrawal in July of, of
next year, and that is--continues to be the plan, and we're going to pursue that on that schedule."
138,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, I'm going to leave it there.  David Axelrod, thank you, as always."
139,MR. AXELROD:  Great to be with you.  Thanks.
140,"MR. GREGORY:  Up next, another key week of Decision 2010, as more contests for November take shape, plus the future of the GOP, the influence of the tea party, and the women who won big on Tuesday night. Our roundtable, two political leaders, one of Tuesday's winners,
California's GOP Senate nominee, Carly Fiorina; and the vice chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Congressman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.  Plus, NBC's Chuck Todd, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, and Politico's Roger Simon, only on MEET THE PRESS."
141,(Announcements)
142,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up, what did Tuesday's election results say about the anti-incumbent mood around the country, the future of the GOP, and the role of women in politics this year?  Our roundtable weighs in right after this brief commercial break."
143,(Announcements)
144,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  And we're back, joined in California this morning by the new Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, Carly Fiorina; here in Washington, the vice chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida; presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who's still getting used to the new surroundings; chief White House correspondent and political director for NBC News, Chuck Todd; and a special welcome back to Politico's chief political columnist, Roger Simon."
145,"Who has really gone through a tough deal with your health, Roger.  God bless you.  We're so happy you are healthy and happy you're here and doing what you should be doing, which is reporting.  And we're... "
146,MR. ROGER SIMON:  Thank you.  And thanks to you and all those people who sent me kind e-mails and cards.  It really helped.
147,"MR. GREGORY:  Oh, good.  Well, we're glad to have you. "
148,"Well, there's a lot to get to, including news, Chuck Todd.  You heard from David Axelrod right here that the president will address the nation, likely from the Oval Office, 8 PM Tuesday night, after he returns from the Gulf. This is a big deal.  This is a big moment now where the White
House says they've got to, they've got to take this to another level."
149,"MR. CHUCK TODD:  Well, there's a phrase that I've heard a lot in the White House over the past couple of weeks, and that's ""command and control."" Privately they'll acknowledge they do not have it when it comes to this oil spill.  So this is--they are looking for a way to find
out--the easiest way to get control of the situation is for the oil to stop leaking.  With that not happening yet, they have to look like they're in more control of the situation with BP.  So that's why you're seeing, not just the ramped-up rhetoric, these letters, getting the CEOs
to come to the White House and now this Oval Office address.  All of it is to deal with this leadership question because that is what's--you know, they want to say, ""Oh, this""--they haven't seen any effect yet in the polls.  Over the last week you're now starting to see an effect. They know it; they are worried about it.  And so this is an attempt to just exert some sort of control.  They may not have command yet of the situation..."
150,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
151,MR. TODD:  ...but at least some sort of control.
152,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Roger, the other element of control, the other element of news here, David Axelrod saying they're--they want to push BP to create an escrow account where they're going to commit some amount of money."
153,MR. SIMON:  Sure.
154,"MR. GREGORY:  That seems to be the real focus from the president, which is lock in the amount that BP will ultimately pay.  That's what, effectively, a government regulator can do at this point. "
155,"MR. SIMON:  If it can be predicted.  They've got a dilemma.  The president told me in an interview just a few days ago that the government had no greater ability to stop this oil leak than BP, so we might as well let BP do it.  The trouble is, at the same time we're dependent on BP, we're fining them, we're threatening to put them in jail, we've got the attorney general going down there.  You know, this is usually not the basis of a good relationship.  Also, the president is a victim of that video of the gushing oil.  I mean, it's a cinematic sign of his failure.
And the real worry at the White House is every time he speaks, is it going to be a split screen..."
156,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
157,MR. SIMON:  ...with him on one side and that gushing oil on the other.
158,"MR. GREGORY:  Carly Fiorina, you are now squarely in the, the political arena here out there in California.  And another Republican has been pretty pointed in his criticism of the president's leadership on this, and that's Mitt Romney.  The president has sometimes referred to Romney
as a likely candidate for the presidency in 2012.  This is what Romney wrote Thursday in an op-ed in the USA Today:  ""Has it come to this again?"" responding to the president's comments to Matt Lauer, ""The president is meeting with his oil spill experts, he crudely tells us, so
that he knows `whose ass to kick.' We have become accustomed to this management style--target a scapegoat, assign blame and go on the attack. To win healthcare legislation, he vilified insurance executives; to escape bankruptcy law for General Motors, he demonized senior lenders; to take the focus from the excesses of government, he castigated business meetings in Las Vegas; and to deflect responsibility for the deepening and lengthening downturn, he blames Wall Street and George W. Bush. But what may make good politics does not make good leadership.  And when a crisis is upon us, America wants a leader, not a politician."" Do you think that's fair?"
159,"MS. CARLY FIORINA:  Well, I think there's much in that that's fair.  And there is a difference, obviously, between governing and leading, and running for office or campaigning.  Look, BP has huge accountability here, and they need to be held to account.  But the government has
accountability as well. When we hear that there are 13 separate federal government agencies running around in confusion down there, when we hear that there is equipment that could be used to help clean up the Gulf sitting in warehouses, when we hear that there is assistance that is being pleaded for by local officials and that assistance is not coming, all of this leads to the impression that this is not yet an effort where the president is exerting as much control as is necessary to get this thing fixed.  Of course BP has responsibility, but we also need to
understand, where were the government regulators?  Where was MMS, despite the fact that the leader of MMS had been brought in by Ken Salazar in a move to reform the agency, according to him?  So I think..."
160,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, this is the Mineral Management Service, which, which oversees these oil rigs.  Congresswoman:"
161,"REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL):  Where, where were the regulators? This from a party who has singlehandedly allowed industry and the private sector to regulate themselves, who presided over a, an agency in MMS that was so cozy with regulators--was so cozy with the oil industry executives that they were going on trips with them, taking vacations, even sleeping with them? So, I mean, we're talking about a party that really doesn't have the right to criticize now in terms of regulation.  We, under President Obama's leadership, are cleaning up that mess and make--and cleaning up the mess of the, of the oil spill.  But this is ultimately
BP's responsibility.  President Obama has commanded over 5,000 vessels in the region to make sure that they are involved in the cleanup, 26,000 federal employees involved in the cleanup down there, mobilized and authorized up to 17,500 members of the National Guard, and is on his way down to the Gulf region for the fourth time.  This is an unprecedented response to an unprecedented manmade disaster."
162,"MR. GREGORY:  Doris, let's put this in a kind of a larger frame here. Something struck me going back, looking at President Obama's interviews over time.  Back in October of 2006 he was on this program, and he said something that really any candidate can say because it becomes true when you're president.  Let's play that."
163,"(Videotape, October 22, 2006)"
164,"PRES. OBAMA:  Most of the time it seems that, that the president has maybe 10 percent of his agenda set by himself and 90 percent of it set by circumstances."
165,(End videotape)
166,"MR. GREGORY:  Et voila.  Ninety--how's he doing with the 90 percent, Doris?"
167,"MS. DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:  Well, you know, it's interesting just listening to what you were saying about how much he actually has mobilized down there--17,000 National Guard, 20,000 people--and yet the impression hasn't gotten to the country about those people being there.
Reagan understood the importance of pictures.  I think if Reagan had been doing this he would have made sure that each time the president went down there that we saw pictures of what these people were doing because we only know it as a list, and we have to somehow counter the oil gushing picture, which is central in our mind."
168,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
169,"MS. GOODWIN:  I think the other interesting thing is when you hear somebody say, ""Well, he shouldn't be showing anger at BP,"" the other side is, we've been hearing, is he's not showing enough anger.  And I think one of the problems with that is he's not a man who does, by nature--he's not T.R., like Theodore Roosevelt would have been bl ustering.  I can just imagine what he would have been saying about the BP guy.  People would have loved it.  But on the other hand, he has to work with BP."
170,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet--but--and yet, Chuck and Roger, I mean, the president is critical of the media and yet responsive to, to some of the demands of, of, of what's been brought up here, Chuck."
171,"MR. TODD:  Well, what's ironic, the comment to Matt Lauer--and yes, it was a response to the whole ""kick butt"" part of the question.  But when he used the, the, the more--the harsher version of the word it was because he was responding to media criticism.  Listen to his whole
answer.  He goes, ""I don't sit around with academics""..."
172,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
173,"MR. TODD:  ...""just because""--and that was a direct response to criticism coming from columns, particularly in the Times and the Post, that have just gotten under his skin.  Media criticism gets under this president's skin and he lets it show more than any president we've seen in a long time."
174,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
175,"MR. SIMON:  And he believes that the anger that people are showing is a media-generated anger and it's the media really cares about his displays and his optics and his stagecraft a lot more than ordinary people do. But what really drives him crazy is statements that we just heard from Carly Fiorina, small government Republicans, now saying, ""Where's the
government?"" You know..."
176,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Exactly.
177,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
178,"MR. SIMON:  ...Bobby Jindal screaming into a microphone, ""Where are the booms?  Where's the equipment?  Where are, where are the ships?"" These are the same people who say, ""Get government out of our lives."" "
179,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, and..."
180,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  David--right.
181,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, hold on a minute, that's--wait, because I wanted to go back to Carly Fiorina.  I mean, respond to that point, Carly, for one. But for two, because there's legitimacy to that, what, what is good government, going forward, in a crisis like this?"
182,"MS. FIORINA:  Good government needs to be efficient and effective.  I'm not talking about small or big, but I know from the real world that when things get too big and too complicated and two expensive, as our government is now, they don't perform well.  These are vast,
unaccountable bureaucracies.  They don't coordinate with one another, and, as a result, they're not effective. And may I just say, it was Ken Salazar who put in place the secretary or the head of MMS who just recently resigned and who came from the industry.  So I think..."
183,"REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  No, he didn't."
184,MS. FIORINA:  ...this is a question of the blame game to say this is all about Republicans...
185,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  He came from the House.
186,"MS. FIORINA:  ...saying small government.  This is about efficient, effective government..."
187,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Birnbaum was from the House.
188,MS. FIORINA:  ...and efficient and effective response.  And what the American people are seeing is an ineffective response.
189,"MR. GREGORY:  Did, did that head of MMS come from--did she work on the hill or did she come from industry?"
190,"REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  The head of MMS was from the House of Representatives.  Liz Birnbaum came from the U.S. House of Representatives. She was an employee for many years, and then she moved from the House of Representatives to MMS. So I don't know what she's
talking about.  But this is a big, expensive disaster."
191,MS. FIORINA:  And she was forced to resign because of her failure to reform the department as she promised to.
192,"REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  In the year--excuse me, excuse me--in the year that she was, that, that she was there, there definitely was not enough reform, but she was cleaning up, in the process of cleaning up from years of a totally hands-off regulatory policy by the Bush administration..."
193,MS. FIORINA:  Then why did she resign?
194,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  ...in which they had a scandal-ridden regulatory agency.
195,"MR. GREGORY:  OK, but, Congresswoman, the reality is that if the president made a priority of reforming MMS, he also made the decision to curtail that reform, if it was incomplete, to move forward on more oil drilling, to..."
196,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Which I don't...
197,MR. GREGORY:  ...to achieve political consensus on climate change legislation.  So it's a question of the choices the president made.
198,"REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Look, as--well, in a--arguably in a year, you weren't going to be able to clean up that regulatory mess that, that essentially was--left, left industry in charge of itself, and that's why we ended up with this BP disaster."
199,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
200,"REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  But as someone, unlike Ms. Fiorina, as someone who represents a Gulf state, who is totally opposed to expanding offshore oil drilling, unlike Ms. Fiorina, who even in the face of this BP disaster, would continue to allow offshore oil drilling as a solution, it
is absolutely..."
201,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
202,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  ...irresponsible to do that.  We need to focus...
203,MS. FIORINA:  If I may--if I may just say...
204,"REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  No, no, no.  You keep interrupting me."
205,"MS. FIORINA:  If I may just say, actually..."
206,"REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Excuse me, excuse me."
207,MS. FIORINA:  ...you--if I may just say that...
208,"MR. GREGORY:  Hold, hold on, hold on one second.  Congressman let's let Carly Fiorina respond.  Go ahead."
209,"MS. FIORINA:  If I might just say, I am not defending the performance of MMS over many years.  Debbie Wasserman Schultz is absolutely correct that MMS has failed in its duties under both Republican and Democratic presidents.  That's a fact.  It is also true that the reason President Obama reversed his decision on shallow offshore drilling is because the people in the Gulf course--Coast were pleading for jobs and we need the energy."
210,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
211,MS. FIORINA:  But what I am saying is this.
212,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  No.  That's...
213,MS. FIORINA:  Do not blame someone else for the failure of government that is now sitting on this president's watch.
214,"MR. GREGORY:  OK.  I want to, I want to move..."
215,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  This is not a failure of government.
216,"MR. GREGORY:  Hold on, hold on one second.  I want to move on to something else.  Actually, I want to bring you in, Doris, on something that Roger wrote based on his interview with the president.  This is what the president said to Roger about the role of regulation.  He writes, ""I
think it's fair to say, if six months ago, before this spill had happened, I had gone up to Congress and I had said we need to crack down a lot harder on oil companies and we need to spend more money on technology to respond in case of a catastrophic spill, there are folks up
there, who will not be named, who would have said this is classic, big government overregulation and wasteful spending."""
217,"MS. GOODWIN:  Now, you see..."
218,"MR. GREGORY:  Even though it's a Democratic Congress, he could have made it a priority."
219,"MS. GOODWIN:  See, now, but that's his righteous anger, I think, in a certain sense.  I mean, he really was getting worked up.  I mean, one of the things they said about FDR was that he theatrically understood that he had to be an actor at times.  Even when he wasn't feeling anger, he would make sure as if he gave voice to the people who had the anger. That's one thing.  The other hand of it, though, I think, is the crisis is just beginning.  Whatever he should have done more, should he gone down there earlier, should have done more, now's the real crisis, is the cleanup.  And just as you said, he's got to take command of that."
220,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  (Unintelligible)
221,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
222,MS. GOODWIN:  And I think this speech the next night could be as important as Johnson's speech in Selma was...
223,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
224,"MS. GOODWIN:  ...to mobilize the country for a climate energy bill, if he does it right, not just get the votes in Congress, push at that Congress from the outside in to say, ""You think this is ugly, just like we thought the troopers were ugly when they were beating up on those civil rights marchers? Let's do something about it."""
225,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Let me get in here.  I want to take a break.  I want to come back and talk about Tuesday night's primary night and the politics of this midterm campaign.  We'll do that with our roundtable when we come back after this short break.
226,(Announcements)
227,"MR. GREGORY:  We're back now with our political roundtable talking about politics, Decision 2010, and what happened on Tuesday night.  Here were some of the headlines about the results from Tuesday.  From The Wall Street Journal, ""Women Candidates Come Into Their Own."" The Washington Times, ""Primaries engender a year of the woman."" The AP headline, ""Deja Vu All Over Again:  2010 Looks Like the '92 Political Year of the Woman."" Here were some of the results to bear that out.  We were talking to Carly Fiorina, who is now the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate from California.  You had former state Representative Sharron Angle, who is now the Republican nominee for the Senate in Nevada.  Senator Lincoln, of course, the incumbent, she holds on, Democratic nominee from Arkansas. Meg Whitman, who's running for governor, is a Republican in California. State Representative Nikki Haley, Republican candidate for South Carolina governor.  She still has a runoff that she has to win."
228,"So, Carly Fiorina, is this about being the year of the woman or is it about outsiders to the process that are making a mark?  What is your take-away?"
229,"MS. FIORINA:  Well, I think it's a little bit of both.  But I think what you're seeing now is candidates are reflecting the diversity of America. And isn't that a wonderful thing?  Isn't that a wonderful evolution?  I think it is a natural progression, and I think it's worth celebrating."
230,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you agree, Congresswoman?"
231,"REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Well, I always think it's funny when the media declares something ""the year of the woman."" I mean, are we..."
232,MR. SIMON:  It happens every year.
233,"REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Yeah.  Are we, are we only entitled to one every 18 years or so?  I mean, that's..."
234,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
235,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  ...that--that's a little...
236,MS. GOODWIN:  It's like that's what Barbara Mikulski was teasing about.
237,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Yeah.
238,"MS. GOODWIN:  ""The year of the asparagus, the year of the carrot."""
239,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Right.
240,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.  Well, though, what's actually--yeah."
241,"MS. GOODWIN:  But I think something is different here.  I think what's different is underneath, there's a social revolution that's gone on in the last 20 years.  Women are now 60 percent college graduates, 68 percent master degree graduates.  More PhDs, more--almost 42 percent
MBAs.  They're coming into their realm in every sphere of society. They're going to be in politics."
242,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, also..."
243,"MS. GOODWIN:  We're late for the world at large, but they're coming."
244,"MR. GREGORY:  ...it's also, to me, it was actually my wife, Beth, who made this observation, which I always take seriously, which is, look, I mean, talk about who's the ultimate outsider.  I mean, men are still running most things."
245,MR. SIMON:  Right.
246,MS. GOODWIN:  Right.
247,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  But...
248,MR. GREGORY:  And not always doing such a great job.
249,"REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  David, let me just jump back in here for a
second..."
250,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
251,"REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  ...because the, the underlying problem here is that across the board, particularly with Republicans, it isn't the year of the woman.  We have 104 members that the NRCC--a 104 races that the NRCC has put on their ""young guns"" watch list.  Of those--and they had a much ballyhooed aggressive attempt to recruit top female candidates--they have seven women out of 104 on that list.  I mean, this is a party that has a brand that women simply don't want to run with and that women don't want to vote for because they don't share the values that women care about."
252,"MR. TODD:  The headlines did feel like an attempt to shoehorn in an, an idea just to sort of make some sort of national perspective out of something..."
253,MS. FIORINA:  Does the press ever do that?
254,"MR. TODD:  Yeah, exactly.  However, I thought mechanically what was fascinating about all of the victors--Nikki Haley, in particular; Meg Whitman as well, Ms. Fiorina, as well as Sharron Angle, is--and Blanche Lincoln--all of them had to withstand huge negative ads.  It is harder to
run a negative campaign against women candidates.  That is a fact.  And I think women candidates in a toxic political environment are more likely to survive right now because the public, part of it is I think they don't believe it yet that somehow women are as dirty as male politicians because of what you just brought up.  But second is that, is that, is that..."
255,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Probably because they're not.
256,MR. TODD:  ...women are just--women's campaigns are better at sort of withstanding this a little bit.
257,"MR. GREGORY:  Roger Simon, what, more broadly, is happening here in terms of Tuesday?  Conventional wisdom gets turned on its head, an incumbent can hold on like Blanche Lincoln despite organized labor coming after her.  You just have an anti-establishment sentiment out there that seems to be more powerful than even an anti-Washington sentiment."
258,"MR. SIMON:  That may be true, but it's important to keep in mind that all but two of the 217 House members who ran for re-election won their primaries.  So it's not exactly a huge wave of anti-Washington feeling. Secondly, I hate to rain on the parade here, these women have won
primaries."
259,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
260,MR. SIMON:  We ought to come back in November and see how many of them...
261,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Right.
262,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
263,MR. SIMON:  ...get elected.
264,"MR. GREGORY:  We've got a program every Sunday, though, right, so we got to keep it going here."
265,"Carly Fiorina, this is something you told The New Yorker in June about the political parties.  ""So what I sense is a lot of frustration with a government they view as out of touch, distant, arrogant, maybe corrupt--and it's a fatigue with professional politicians, of both parties."" As a Senate candidate in the Republican Party, can we expect you to buck your party?  And what issue that Republicans hold near and dear is something that you would find yourself parting company with?"
266,"MS. FIORINA:  Well, let me first say that I've never been in politics before. I've never run for office.  But I think our Founding Fathers intended this to be a citizen government.  It's what, ""of, by and for the people"" means.  And what I sense in the state of California is a lot of
people agree with me.  And they think that the lessons we learn in the real world would help in Washington.  You know, common sense, problem-solving ability, actions speak louder that words, results count. Those are things that people want to see more of in Washington.  If I am
fortunate enough to win this seat in November, it will be because the people of California send me to Washington, not the Republican Party.  I am my own person..."
267,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
268,MS. FIORINA:  ...and I will continue to be my own person.
269,MR. GREGORY:  I have to say that sounds a little Schwarzeneggeresque. Are you a Schwarzenegger Republican?
270,"MS. FIORINA:  I have very different core values than Arnold Schwarzenegger ran on.  But I believe that this election is going to be about jobs.  We are destroying jobs in California through bad government policy.  Since the institution of the stimulus package, our unemployment picture has deteriorated substantially.  And this election is about out-of-control government that is taxing too much, spending too much and borrowing too much."
271,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
272,"MS. FIORINA:  And you look at every poll in California, you will find that the Democrats, Independents and Republicans all think those are the issues in this election."
273,"MR. GREGORY:  Fifteen seconds, Congresswoman.  Final word."
274,"REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Craig you'll note, you'll note that Carly didn't mention anything that she disagrees with the Republican Party because she essentially doesn't.  She's pro-gun, she's anti-choice, she supports expanded offshore oil drilling as a solution to our energy
problems. She has literally bought into the entire agenda lock, stock and barrel and continues to want to push this--the United States towards private industry away from balance..."
275,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
276,REP. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  ...which is what President Obama has been pushing for.
277,MR. GREGORY:  The debate in California and beyond will go on.  Thank you all very much.

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, disaster in the Gulf with no end in sight and a looming summer of oil.  Was this the defining week in the Gulf Coast crisis?  The issues:  containment of the oil and cleanup, holding BP accountable, the impact on the Obama presidency, the future of offshore drilling, and will Washington think big about finding other sources of energy? This morning, our special discussion.  With us, Kenneth Feinberg, the independent administrator of the BP oil spill victim compensation fund; Mississippi's governor, Republican Haley Barbour; Louisiana senator, Democrat Mary Landrieu; the chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, Democrat Ed Markey of Massachusetts; the former president of the Shell Oil Company, John Hofmeister; and ""BBC World News America""'s Katty Kay.

2,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS, with David
Gregory."
3,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
4,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  After BP's Tony Hayward turned in a poor performance on Capitol Hill this week, he appears to have made matters worse by attending a yacht race over the weekend, drawing yet more criticism from many on the Gulf Coast and beyond who feel that the oil company's chief executive has been sorely out of touch since this disaster began 62 days
ago.  This as officials project that 90 percent of the oil will be contained by the end of the month. "
5,Here are the latest government predictions showing where the surface oil will be by noon today.  The blue on this chart represents the trajectory of the spill.  The darker shades are the heavier pockets of oil. 
6,"We go now live to Venice, Louisiana, where NBC News chief environmental affairs  correspondent Anne Thompson is standing by."
7,"And, Anne, I want to ask you, through all your reporting down there, to give us a sense of that level of frustration with Tony Hayward, with BP at this juncture in terms of what they're doing, what they're not doing, and how they're conducting themselves."
8,"ANNE THOMPSON reporting: David, the frustration is immense down here, and it's on several levels. First of all, the people who live here along the southern coast of Louisiana, they know these waters better than anyone else.  They have made their living off these marshes and these waters for generations, and they feel frustrated that in order to defend their coast they have to go to the company that has fouled their coast, BP, and they have to go through the federal government. And there's all this red tape, and it has existed throughout the response from the amount of boom that they have requested to getting those sand berms, those new barrier islands built--they had a plan in front of the federal government for weeks before they got approval--to just this week, those vacuum barges that Governor Jindal and the Plaquemines Parish Billy Nungesser have been promoting.  They were actually shut down by the Coast Guard for the--for safety inspections to see if they had life jackets.  And then the Coast Guard never did the inspections.  And it's that kind of frustration that has people here just so angry.  And, and it's now--we're going into the ninth week, it'll be the ninth week starting Tuesday, and they still have this huge problem and very little impact in stopping the oil."

11,"MR. GREGORY:  Anne, what is the latest on Tony Hayward's position at the company?  Because there was some confusion about this as to whether he's still on the job."
12,"THOMPSON:  Mm-hmm.  And I think this just, you know, points to all the confusion, and it, and it comes from the very highest levels of the world's third largest oil company, David.  Earlier this week, the chairman of BP did an interview with a British television service and said that Tony Hayward was going to move off from the day-to-day operations.  And he cited some of the problems that Tony Hayward has had in dealing with this issue, some of the comments he has made, most famously that he wanted his ""life back."" And so the impression was that Tony Hayward was being removed from the spill response team.  And then on Saturday the BP London office had to issue a clarification, saying no, that Tony Hayward would continue to oversee the response, that Bob Dudley, who's the managing director, he would head a separate organization to deal with the long-term response because this isn't a problem that's going to go away anytime soon. "
13,"MR. GREGORY:  Anne Thompson, thank you for all your reporting down there throughout this crisis."
14,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Joining us now from Jackson, Mississippi, Governor Haley Barbour.  And with us here in Washington, Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu; Congressman Ed Markey of the Energy Committee; the former president of Shell Oil, John Hofmeister; and Katty Kay of the BBC.  We will also bring in shortly Ken Feinberg, who is, of course, heading up the administration of that BP compensation fund, $20 billion worth. We'll speak to him exclusively about that important task, that mammoth task that lies ahead of him, and we'll do that in just a couple of moments."
15,I want to go to Governor Barbour first of all in this disaster zone.
16,"Governor, welcome.  You met with the president he's been down there visiting here in the past week and a half.  What is your assessment of how well-coordinated the federal, state and local officials are, not only in your state but also in Louisiana and Florida?"
17,"GOV. HALEY BARBOUR (R-MS):  Well, of course, there's nothing satisfactory until the well's shut in.  It's when the well's capped and then clean up the oil and then BP pay the bills.  Until, until all of that is done, nothing is satisfactory.  But as I've said before, and said to the president, I think the federal government's done more right than wrong. I thought appointing Ken Feinberg, who's got a great reputation that's well-deserved, is good for BP and good for the government.  Get BP out of that.  But BP's got to pay, and everybody has to understand it.  BP's the responsible party, we expect them to pay for everything."
18,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator, from Louisiana, there's been a lot of frustration in your state, the governor's frustrated, and as I talk to people and if you follow the press down there, there is just complaints about the assets that are being brought to bear, the coordination between folks.  I know there's even people who are in the federal government saying there's
a lack of strategic communications as this oil moves toward Florida in the early part of next week.  Do you agree with Governor Barbour, more right than wrong?"
19,"SEN. MARY LANDRIEU (D-LA):  Well, it's not been satisfactory, as the governor said, but the president and his team are getting their legs underneath them. I think the president was a little slow off the block. His Cabinet was there from day one.  The Coast Guard was there from day
one.  This is unprecedented in the amount of oil and, and the situation about this gushing geyser under the ocean.  So the command and control needs to be improved, the claims process needs to be accelerated.  But I've really seen, David, in the last several weeks much more of the team coming together, organizing themselves in a way to tackle this challenge
and to meet the challenge as this presents."
20,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman Markey, we've got this live image on the, the, the seafloor that shows the belching oil into the Gulf.  In many ways, this could become an iconic image of this presidency politically.  But, substantively, there's a question of the oil flow.  And here is a
breakdown of what the projections of the flow have actually been that have been so frustrating to people.  You go back to April 24th, they said no, it's 1,000 barrels per day; April 28th, oh, no, it's 5,000 per day; May 27th, no, 12,000 to 19,000; June 10th, 20,000 to 40,000; we find out June 15th 35,000 to 60,000.  Now the president's out there saying 90 percent contained by the end of the month.  Do you actually think that that flow, that rate of oil goes up before it goes down?"
21,"REP. ED MARKEY (D-MA):  Right now, again, we're dependent upon BP and the execution of their capacity to be able to put a cap over this well.  I actually have a document that shows that BP actually believes it could go upwards of 100,000 barrels per day, which would be about four million barrels a day.  So again, right from the beginning, BP was either lying or grossly incompetent.  First they said it was only 1,000 barrels, then they said it was 5,000 barrels, now we're up to 100,000 barrels.  It was their technology, it was their spill camp, they're the ones that should have known right from the beginning; and either to limit their liability or because they were grossly incompetent, they delayed a full response to the magnitude of this disaster."
22,"MR. GREGORY:  John Hofmeister, you--you've been in the industry.  I've talked to people in the oil industry this week who are not very impressed with BP. They said that they--there were about five different stop signs that they ran through when they drilled this well.  What is your
assessment, though, in this narrow space of how well things are operating right now toward the goal of plugging the leak? "
23,"MR. JOHN HOFMEISTER:  I think we obviously have to find out what happened to cause the blowout.  That sounds like gross incompetence or negligence or, or just pure mismanagement.  But with respect to what was done at the bottom of the sea to try to stop the blowout in the first few weeks, I don't think any company could have done it better because they had people 
from all over the world, people from every major oil company advising, and they are competent in what they're doing at that level.  With respect to the cleanup, I think it's been ham-handed.  It's been just awful.  To use booms and, and mops and dispersants and burning and so forth, skimming with shrimp boats, where's the imagination and the scale?  One of the things that the oil industry does best is it knows how to scale things, to do the big jobs very well.  And scaling to me means bring hundreds of barges and block the marshes with hundreds of barges with big suction pumps.  Take supertankers and cruise them back and forth and back
and forth on the surface of the ocean, depositing the oily water in refineries on the coast."
24,"MR. GREGORY:  You know, to that point I'll bring Katty Kay in on this. Gene Robinson with The Washington Post wrote an op-ed piece this week that kind of went to that point.  Again, how's the government doing in the immediate task of stopping the leak?  And this is what Gene wrote: ""Why haven't skimmers been brought in from around the world to scoop up more of the oil?  Why isn't the defense of the coastline being run like a military campaign, with failure not an option?  ...  Every available piece of equipment in the world that can vacuum, skim, scoop or sop up oil ought to be in the Gulf by now, deployed under a central--probably military--command structure.  The beaches should be defended as if from a threatened enemy invasion.  This is the time for overkill, for the Powell Doctrine, for `decisive force.'"""
25,"Has there been decisive force, Katty?"
26,"MS. KATTY KAY:  No, there clearly hasn't been decisive force.  And what we saw the president do this week in his Oval Office address to the nation was at least use the language of decisive force.  He started talking about a battle plan.  He compared this to 9/11.  But the risk of that is that once you start using warlike language, you have to win.  And the truth is the president can't win capping this one, that is dependent on BP.  So you have an inherent tension with the president wanting to fix this problem and, frankly, not being able to fix this problem at the
moment."
27,"MR. GREGORY:  But is there, is there a problem here of a learning curve, Senator?  I mean, is, is the federal government equipped to--obviously, we know the federal government's not equipped to stop the, the spill or plug the leak.  You've got to have that level of expertise.  But it does seem, and Thad Allen even referred to that in The Wall Street Journal this week, as if there is a learning curve because nobody's got the experience to deal with a large-scale spill like this. "
28,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  We are, we are, we are in a learning curve.  But I want to say something in response to what Ed Markey said, that we're just not relying on BP.  As John said, there are almost every industry at every level--the secretary of Energy, Secretary Salazar, are working in that operation center with BP.  We're not just relying on BP to plug this, to plug this well and to get this job done.  We're relying on them to pay every bill, and we want to make sure that they do.  But we're all on a learning curve."
29,"I learned this week that Canada and--as one country, for instance--does spills into their water to practice in the event that this would happen. That is not allowed in the United States.  Maybe we should think about that.  So this is like going through something where we've never had a fire drill.  Now, there should have been more things in place.  We can get more things in place.  But I want to make it clear, in defense of this administration, they're just not relying on BP.  Shell's been at the table, Exxon's been at the table, experts from around... "
30,"MR. GREGORY:  But that's been a criticism.  I mean, it... "
31,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  No, it has."
32,MR. GREGORY:  ...whether they're really relying on industry enough.
33,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  They are--I can promise you that they are relying on industries across the board, plus they're relying on their internal scientists and expertise."
34,MR. GREGORY:  What have they asked the oil industry writ large to do to help?
35,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  I think that they've brought their engineers in.  I don't think, I know.  I mean, Ken Salazar's been in the operations room.  But, you know, nothing has been satisfactory.  But, you know, in defense of the administration, because they've gotten beat up pretty badly, they have had expertise.  Now, John is correct.  I think there's a lot more scale that could be brought, you know, to the situation, and I'm hoping that we can do that."
36,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, and, John, why, why--talk about foreign assets, right? So if another company says, ""Look, we've got experience with this. We're going to send you, you know, send you our skimmers, send our""--and there seems the government has processes they have to go through before they can say yes to that."
37,"MR. HOFMEISTER:  Well, there's a Jones Act that gets in the way.  The Jones Act, decades-long enforced, prevents foreign ships from operating in domestic waters."
38,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm. 
39,"MR. HOFMEISTER:  It would have to have a waiver.  There was a waiver after Katrina to help do whatever needed to be done.  There should be a waiver now. This is a unique, unprecedented situation.  The U.S. hasn't made supertankers in for--ever.  Supertankers have always been made in foreign shipbuilding yards.  And we need to bring that kind of scale to bear, in my opinion."
40,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman, you're shaking your head.  You don't..."
41,"REP. MARKEY:  The, the Jones Act, the Jones Act does not apply to situations like this, emergency situations, relief situations."
42,MR. GREGORY:  You should be able to get those ships in there right away.
43,"REP. MARKEY:  Yeah, and they can.  There has been no request from another country that has been denied by the Obama administration at all."
44,MR. GREGORY:  So you think all the assets are being used that could be used?
45,"REP. MARKEY:  They--listen, let's get right back--let's go right back to the very beginning of this, which is that in a hearing this week it was clear that all of the oil companies had been basically lying about their capacity to respond to a spill of this size.  They said that they basically would be capable of evacuating walruses from the Gulf of Mexico when there hadn't been one there in three million years.  They were going to be relying upon dead scientists with their phone numbers in the, in the report.  And in the testimony today each one--this past week--each one of the CEOs said that, in fact, they were not prepared.  They couldn't do a better job in responding. So..."
46,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, I want to get to the issue of preparation in just, in just a minute, though.  I want to go back to Governor Barbour."
47,"GOV. BARBOUR:  Yeah, David, if I..."
48,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah, go ahead, and then I want to ask you to respond to something else."
49,"GOV. BARBOUR:  Yeah, David, I was just, I was--well, I was just going to say, Senator Landrieu made a point earlier about command and control, which has been a huge problem.  We recruited 1,200--1,163 vessels to work on our spill, designed a multilayered plan to start defending our shores 20 miles south of the barrier islands.  And then, unfortunately, the
Coast Guard told us weeks later, ""Well, we don't have a way to communicate with those vessels.  We don't have a way to identify even where they are.  And so we've been relying for about three weeks on a system that existed but couldn't be executed."" To their credit, in the
last two weeks the Coast Guard has, has, has corrected that or begun the correction of that.  But while we've got a very different situation from Louisiana, the fact is the government's trying but the government is not getting the job done right now."
50,"MR. GREGORY:  Can I have you respond ultimately, Governor, to the sense of what government is capable of here?  Because that's what people are really thinking about in the long term.  Here's what the president said. He issued a promise when he was in Alabama, Theodore, Alabama, this week. Let's listen to that."
51,"(Videotape, Monday)"
52,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  We are going to do everything we can 24/7 to make sure that communities get back on their feet.  And in the end, I am confident that we're going to be able to leave the Gulf Coast in better shape than it was before."
53,(End videotape)
54,"MR. GREGORY:  ""In better shape than it was before."" That caught my eye and my team because we went back to 2005, President Bush speaking in New Orleans, and this is among the promises he made. "
55,"(Videotape, September 15, 2005)"
56,"FMR. PRES. GEORGE W. BUSH:  Our third commitment is this:  When communities are rebuilt, they must be even better and stronger than before the storm."
57,(End videotape)
58,"MR. GREGORY:  It didn't appear, Governor, to work so well after Hurricane Katrina.  Can the government do it differently this time?"
59,"GOV. BARBOUR:  Well, the big thing for us in the coast after Katrina, on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, while the government provided enormous amounts of resources for which we're grateful, it also gave us the latitude where the local people decided how the coast was going to be
real--rebuilt.  And in fact, it's going to be and is in the process of being rebuilt bigger and better than it was before.  But the federal government can't do that.  The federal government can't dictate that to the Gulf Coast, to Mississippi or Louisiana or Florida or Alabama.  Those
kind of decisions abou t how to rebuild are decisions for the local people.  I am glad that--and expect BP to pay for everything, and the government has talked like--and I believe from this Mavis commission that they're going to try to put in some additional resources.  But the local
people got to make the decisions about recovery, about rebuilding the coast."
60,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but, but..."
61,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  David, I've got..."
62,MR. GREGORY:  Senator.
63,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  Let me, let me jump in here, because this is something that I've worked on almost for 20 years, and our state has been leading the effort along the Gulf Coast to build a more resilient coast.  This is not just America's wetlands, and we share some of these wetlands with Mississippi, these are America's wetlands.  The Mississippi River drains about 40 percent of the continent.  John Hoftemeister has been one of the great leaders, along with environmental groups and the industry, and we've put together a great coalition over the years to say to the country and to the companies operating in the Gulf, ""Share your resources that you are taking out of this gulf, millions and billions of dollars a year.  Give the states along the coast, whether
they drill or not, some resources to build these barrier islands, to restore our marshes and to give the people an opportunity."""
64,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
65,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  But I'll say this:  Yes, we need more local control at the local level, but the federal government has a great role to play. And as we've seen, corporations left to do their own will, sometimes make huge mistakes.  So we need government oversight."
66,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Katty, can, can the president make good on that promise? Because President Bush certainly had a difficult time doing it. "
67,"MS. KAY:  Well, it's very interesting.  I've just come back from Louisiana, and the Senator kindly corrected my pronunciation of Buras earlier in the program.  But people down there--and I was listening to Anne Thompson's comment that people are very frustrated with BP--they are
frustrated with BP. But they also want the oil industry down there. These are families where half the family might be working in the fishing industry, the other half the family might be working in the oil industry. And they don't like the moratorium on offshore drilling, and they're
saying, ""We are being hit twice.  We've been hit by the oil spill and the threat to tourism, and now we're being hit by the moratorium.  And if we go ahead with this moratorium, the jobs will move across to Brazil or elsewhere in the world."" And that's something that they do feel that the federal government could do for them is keep the oil industry there."
68,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
69,"MS. KAY:  I was very struck by actually some--one businessman saying to me, ""Listen, we shouldn't be banning BP and banning--boycotting BP.  We should be buying BP because we need them to stay a strong company, we need them to do the cleanup, and we need the oil industry to provide jobs for us."""
70,"MR. GREGORY:  Let, let me pause for just a minute.  And I want to turn now to Ken Feinberg, the man who's now overseeing BP's $20 billion compensation fund."
71,"Mr. Feinberg, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS."
72,MR. KENNETH FEINBERG:  Thank you.
73,"MR. GREGORY:  You've got great experience on such horrible circumstances, the 9/11 compensation fund, among others in your experience.  And I was speaking to somebody the other day who--whose brother grew up on his dad's boat as a, as a fisherman, as a shrimper.  It's all he's known his whole life, and he's gone through his life, and all of a sudden it stops
cold, his livelihood is gone, not to return.  What does that guy do as he turns to you and this compensation fund?  What does he get? "
74,"MR. FEINBERG:  He files a claim and he gets paid and he gets paid promptly. The president of the United States has instructed me, ""Get these claims paid, get them played--paid quickly."" When I met with Governor Barbour, he told me frankly, ""Ken, time is the enemy."" And he's so right here.  I must make sure that this $20 billion fund provides for prompt payment, full compensation. It's an independent program.  I'm not beholden to the administration; I'm not beholden to BP."
75,"MR. GREGORY:  But BP pays your bills, right?"
76,MR. FEINBERG:  Who else can pay the bills?
77,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
78,"MR. FEINBERG:  You can't ask people in the Gulf to pay the bills.  You can't ask state or federal government to pay the bills.  What is the alternative? BP is stepping up, and they're going to make sure, I'm going to make sure that every eligible, legitimate claim is paid and paid
quickly."
79,"MR. GREGORY:  So what happens--so--all right, so let's take our example of the shrimper.  Out of business, doesn't know, you know, what he's going to do even for the immediate first few months.  How much money do--does that shrimper get?  But then what happens over the longer term? Is this one of these deals where you get one payment and then you say, ""Therefore, I'm not going to sue in the future""?"
80,"MR. FEINBERG:  Not--absolutely not.  That shrimper should come right into this fund, doesn't need a lawyer, doesn't have to pay a lawyer 40 percent of what he receives.  He should come into the fund, he will get an emergency payment without any obligation as long as he can demonstrate he's got a legitimate claim, of course.  But we will pay that claim immediately, and then sit with him and over the next 30, 45 days, come up with a program that will provide him full compensation."
81,"MR. GREGORY:  You talk about legitimate claims.  That's, of course, a big issue.  And Tony Hayward is outspoken yet again on this point, quoted in The Times of London.  Let me show it to you on the screen.  ""Mr. Hayward reiterated a promise that BP `will honor all legitimate claims for business interruption.' This was in The Times of London.  ""Asked for examples of illegitimate claims, he said, `I could give you lots of examples.  This is America - come on.  We're going to have lots of illegitimate claims.  We all know that.'"" What's legitimate, what's
illegitimate?"
82,"MR. FEINBERG:  We'll have to look at each claim.  Now, the Congress provided some valuable guidance in the 911 fund as to what constitutes a legitimate claim.  The direct causal connection between the claim and the spill, pay it. If it's an indirect claim, a restaurant in, in Las Vegas or Omaha, ""I can't get shrimp so our business is being harmed,"" in the 911 fund, Congress said look to the law of the state of that claimant's residence.  Would the law allow such a claim?  It may be, as we develop this program, that congressional guidance in 911 might work here as well."
83,"MR. GREGORY:  You're, you're in the vortex of politics whether you stay clear of it or not.  And Joe Barton from Texas was--got in a lot of trouble for something he said, apologizing to BP.  Let me play you a portion of that."
84,"(Videotape, Thursday)"
85,"REP. JOE BARTON (R-TX):  And I'm ashamed of what happened in the White House yesterday.  I think it is a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a ""shakedown."" So I'm only speaking for myself, I'm not speaking for anybody else, but I apologize."
86,(End videotape)
87,MR. GREGORY:  Is this BP fund of $20 billion a shakedown?
88,"MR. FEINBERG:  I don't think it's a shakedown.  I, I think that BP--to BP's credit, in these other programs that I've set up, David, there was nothing in place.  We had to start from scratch.  Here there is a program in place.  Now, it's not efficient as it should be.  It's not working as
well as it should be, but BP's paid $100 million worth of claims so far. We can do better, and we can do quicker.  But I don't think it helps to politicize this program.  These people in the Gulf are in desperate straits.  And I'm getting great advice from Governor Barbour and Governor
Jindal.  I got some fabulous advice this morning from Senator Landrieu, who said, as for business interruption, maybe we ought to cluster all the oyster claims, all the fisherman claims, all the tourism claims, come up with a common methodology.  This is input that is bipartisan.  And as in these other programs I've done, I think it's pretty important to try and keep it bipartisan."
89,"MR. GREGORY:  I, I, I just want to try to button up the, the process here, which I, I think is complicated.  So if you have an emergency claim, you may have an emergency claim for, you know, your loss of business in the immediate period.  How do you make an assessment over the
longer term what somebody who's lost their livelihood should get, how much money should they get?"
90,"MR. FEINBERG:  Well, in the short term, emergency payments with minimum corroboration, that's easy.  In the longer term, just as with the 911 fund, we'll have to develop a business interruption methodology.  Look, file your claim, give us some information on what you've earned in the past, not a lot, not detailed, so that we can, within 30 to 45 days, try and get checks out on business interruption.  I think John is correct in your panel, it sure would help me if the oil would stop flowing so we could get some break date from which we develop these formulas."
91,"MR. GREGORY:  And by the way, when you say a method--in other words, just like in 911 where it was the grim task of assessing the worth of a life, frankly, in that kind of situation, here you have to try to assess what are projected earnings, a projected income that a fisherman might have over a period of time and make a certain judgment based on that.  But on the suing issue, on the litigation, I mean, look, you're a lawyer, you know well that BP's going to be in court forever, frankly, on claims. Now, a lot of people would say, ""Hey, they got this escrow fund.  This is just a way to mitigate that.  This is a way to get people to stop suing to pay out less.  It's an up-front settlement."" What do--what legal recourse will folks have beyond the money that they get for business interruption down the road?"
92,"MR. FEINBERG:  As with 911, you know the 911 fund well, David, this is a voluntary program.  Nobody's compelled to come into this fund.  I would urge everybody to come into this fund.  Quicker payments, faster consideration. You go and litigate, you're going to litigate for years,
the result is uncertain, your lawyer is waiting with a contingency percentage.  I mean, it's the trade-off.  Now, I'm confident, as with the 911 fund, that if claimants enter this fund voluntarily, they will be treated fairly, they will be treated in a comprehensive way, they'll be
given emergency payments with no, no requirement in terms of waiving your right to sue.  These emergency payments are without condition.  And then we'll, I think, be able to, to treat everybody fairly."
93,"MR. GREGORY:  Ken Feinberg, good luck with your work and thank you very much."
94,MR. FEINBERG:  Thank you.
95,MR. GREGORY:  I want to turn back to our discussion.
96,"Senator Landrieu, before I ask you for some reaction to that, let me put up on the screen a sense of where public opinion is about BP and on this issue of payments.  It was really striking what Gallup found this week on how much BP should pay.  Fifty-nine percent say they should pay for everything even if doing so drives them out of business.  So that's the backdrop for how this fund is operating.  React to what you've heard. "
97,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  It's very, it's very difficult.  But let me go back to what Katty said.  If you polled that nationally, you'll see that 59 percent want BP to go out of business, if you polled it in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama to Florida, that's the last company that our people want to see go out of business because we're the ones at the other end of the line.  We want them to stay in business and pay these claims.  And it may be over $20 billion.  But I'm so proud of Ken and the president for appointing him, because the poor fishermen in Alaska, Ed Markey and John, they waited 20 years for justice.  We cannot wait that long in the Gulf. So this is a way for people to get full payment.  And it's not just $5,000 and $10,000, David.  If a fisherman made $50,000 last year, Ken should write them a check for $50,000.  But this is where it gets a little tricky.  What about the quality of the water and the ability of fishermen to fish over the next two, three, four, five years? That's where we're going to have to have some collaboration.  But let's make it quick, let's expedite the claim payment.  I know the governors along the Gulf Coast and the mayors along the Gulf Coast are hearing this from their people."
98,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor, you--Governor Barbour, you've been concerned about the idea of this escrow fund, this $20 billion fund.  Why? "
99,"GOV. BARBOUR:  Right.  Well, I thought that they were talking about taking $20 billion from BP all at once, and my fear was if you took $20 billion from them all at once, put it in an escrow account, then they wouldn't have the working capital to generate the revenue to pay us.  I
think the president was smart, and I congratulate him and BP that they reached an agreement.  Instead of $20 billion taken out of that working capital all at once, it's actually going to be $5 billion this year, $5 billion the next year, $5 billion the following year and $5 billion the fourth year.  That makes sure--as Mary Landrieu says, we want to make sure that BP stays in business, generates the revenues that will pay what they owe the states and our citizens.  And I think the--I don't know if it's a compromise or not--the agreement they worked out not to do all the $20 billion, put it in an escrow account all at once, means that we're
much more likely to get everything paid by BP, who, by the way, is supposed to pay everything."
100,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman, are you satisfied with this?"
101,"REP. MARKEY:  Yes.  I think that, I think that this is really not a slush fund, it's not a shakedown.  It's, it's really a lifeboat for the people in the Gulf.  There could be no one better than Ken Feinberg to administer it. It's going to give people some hope that their families
might not have their lives permanently changed by this event just a couple of years after Katrina. And I think that the president has stepped up in order to ensure that the government works in the best way that the government should work to protect citizens against the worst egregious actions of the private sector.  And, and so I think that the American people are in agreement, and that's, that's liberals and conservatives across the board that we're now finally beginning to do the right thing for the people in the Gulf."
102,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me go back to Katty Kay because this--the achievement of this fund was an important achievement for President Obama this week, and there's been a lot of focus on how he's performed, how the president has handled this crisis, and a lot of frustration around the country."
103,"It was interesting, Tom DeFrank wrote in The New York Daily News an analysis of whether this was his ""Hurricane Katrina"" or something else, and I'll put it up on the screen his analysis.  ""The oil spill hijacking Obama's presidency"" isn't Katrina.  ""It could be worse--more like the Iranian hostage crisis, which destroyed Carter.  ..."
104,"""Each day the cable networks showcase images of more oil belching from the ocean floor resurrects symbolic parallels to the '79 through '81 Iranian debacle, which ended with Tehran releasing U.S. diplomats 444 days after their capture, on the day Ronald Reagan took office.  Try as he might, Carter couldn't get the hostages set free.  ..."
105,"""Obama risks being similarly victimized by the same perception that nothing works anymore."" Is the--there a level of confidence now in the White House that didn't exist last week, that the $20 billion fund represents something the government can do well?"
106,"MS. KAY:  I'm not sure that there should be that level of confidence.  I don't think this was a massively good week for the president.  The $20 billion fund was very important, but the oil spill has played into a perception that this is a president who finds it difficult to empathize with ordinary people, and that was one of the criticisms of him early on in this, that he didn't show enough emotion, he didn't show enough anger, and that he's not totally in control of this, and that his vision of big government is not particularly fixing this. And I think that narrative
is still dominating the scenario."
107,"What he needed to do was come up with a concrete result.  The speech that he gave from the Oval Office I think was pretty much a wash.  I'm not entirely convinced of the need to have given that.  The biggest thing that they got out of this was the $20 billion fund, and certainly down on the Gulf Coast that was all people were talking about.  And they were talking about it particularly because these were people who had come out of Hurricane Katrina, battled with insurance companies to try and get money back, found that it was a very complicated, very long-winded process, and they like the idea that the money is there in escrow, administered by somebody else."
108,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator Landrieu, you, you, you were critical.  I mean, even this past week you were saying that folks along the coast are not happy with anybody right now.  You said it was troubling to see that another president would get the same kind of response that President Bush got after Hurricane Katrina.  And that, ultimately, you said, in a crisis people want to see the commander-in-chief in charge.  Do you feel he's achieved that now?"
109,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  And they have been seeing that lately.  And I want to say that I thought the Oval Office presentation and speech was excellent. The people that I represent were very happy to see the president speaking from the Oval Office because we think we have a national catastrophe, and that was verified, basically, by the president giving that speech from the Oval Office. Now, the proof is in the pudding.  As I said, he was a little slow off the block, his Cabinet was there from the beginning, but he has lent his voice. And I think this claims process, as Ken said, is a testament to how the president, who set up this escrow account, who stepped up to do it, who can get these claims processed.  Not only did our people have to fight insurance companies, we had to fight the federal government in the last administration to get justice for the people along the Gulf Coast, at least those of us from Louisiana.  So we're happy to see this president step up and to get this claims process paid.  But ultimately, David, what the Gulf Coast needs is a long-term restoration plan, and this is the first president that's used those words from the Oval Office, and that's music to the ears of people who are now up to their knees in oil.  But we've been up to our chin in water, and we're tired of it.  We need a internationally scaled plan that some of us have been working on for a long time to make sure this never happens again."
110,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Well, we're..."
111,SEN. LANDRIEU:  And more regulation for the industry in the Gulf.
112,"MR. GREGORY:  We're going to come back and talk about some, some of these--the future here and some of these bigger questions.  But before I take a break, Governor Barbour, what about the president's performance? You're a chief executive, New York Times this morning says you might be running for president in 2012, I know you won't make that decision now. But how do you assess how the president's done?"
113,"GOV. BARBOUR:  Well, first of all, this is an unprecedented, unforeseeable, huge disaster.  So, as somebody who had to go through Katrina, I understand when you--nobody's ever done something like this before, not everything's going to go right.  And the, and the government has made some bad mistakes, they've done some things wrong, but as I said earlier, they've done more right than wrong.  But until the well's capped, until the oil's cleaned up, till the bills are paid, everybody in America--I mean, who could say the administration's done a great job when the well hasn't been capped, oil, oil hasn't been cleaned up out of the water, and we haven't been paid.  So when the American people say, ""Hey, there's a shortcoming here,"" they're just expressing the obvious."
114,"MR. GREGORY:  But you are also a leader in the Republican Party, head of the Republican Governors Association, is your message to your party, ""Don't pile on here, be constructive, don't go after the president""? "
115,"GOV. BARBOUR:  Well, that's certainly the way I feel about it.  My message always is, look, tell the truth, you know, put the, put the truth out, let the, let the public decide.  The public's decision right now is pretty bad for the president."
116,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
117,"GOV. BARBOUR:  But that--I'm not going to pile on, as you've seen by the last 30 or 45 minutes of us talking."
118,"MR. GREGORY:  But you heard from the chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, in an interview this morning saying they're going to make this issue of Joe Barton and his apology to BP, Democrats plan to make that an election issue in November.  Should it be?"
119,"GOV. BARBOUR:  Well, they're going to try to make anything but this oil spill a--they, they want to change the subject, and I can understand that.  But, you know, one of the things that they've got to come to grips with that's very true, we've talked about Ken Feinberg's appointment being good for the president, it's good for BP.  BP--that was to their advantage to get taken out of the claims business.  The $20 billion, once it was done, where BP could continue to operate as a, as a growing concern and pay their bills that they owe Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida and Alabama, that also was a good deal for BP."
120,"MR. GREGORY:  But the question is whether Republicans as a political matter, as a substantive matter, are too cozy with the oil industry. "
121,"GOV. BARBOUR:  Well, look, you're looking at a guy that's already told you 15 times today BP's responsible to pay every penny of this.  We expect them to pay every penny of this.  We're going to demand they pay every penny of this. And if that makes me cozy with BP, it's because I want to make sure that my people stay in their, stay in their wallet and their checkbook."
122,MR. GREGORY:  So you thought Barton was wrong? 
123,"GOV. BARBOUR:  Well, I don't think what he said was accurate because I think the way this worked out was that--was dividing it up into $5 billion a year instead of one $20 billion lump sum I think actually is a fair, good deal for everybody."
124,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
125,GOV. BARBOUR:  Including BP.
126,"MR. GREGORY:  I'm going to take a break here and we're going to come back and continue our discussion and look at some of the bigger questions about the fallout, the future of our energy policy, holding BP accountable, and this question of what do we do with so much risk in the
system?  How do we better manage it?  When we come back on MEET THE PRESS."
127,(Announcements)
128,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up, what role will the Gulf spill play in America's future dependence on oil?  We'll continue our discussion with key voices on this issue after a brief commercial break."
129,(Announcements)
130,MR. GREGORY:  We're back on our special program devoted to the disaster in the Gulf Coast.
131,"I want to get to an issue that just came up that I think is so important, and that, that is the balance here between government and government regulation, and technology and the art of what is possible.  We are living in a world now where we are capable of so much, and we demand so much as a society and, as a planet, we demand so much.  And yet in the process, we're tolerating a great deal of risk.  So when something goes bad, the capacity to stop systemic disaster is very, very difficult.  So it's a question for business, it's a question for government."
132,"And, Congressman Markey, you know, if you turn on your TV this week you see government, you see members on Capitol Hill, including yourself, going after the oil companies, going after BP, and yet isn't it fair to ask where were you?  Where was government regulation when all of this was going on before it was a crisis?"
133,"REP. MARKEY:  I, I agree with you.  When an agency responsible for safety turns into a lapdog and not a watchdog, then, unfortunately, boosterism creates complacency, and complacency leads to disaster.  It happened in the financial sector.  Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns and AIG, they all said, ""There's no risk with derivatives and credit default swaps.  Don't worry."" And it created a financial disaster.  The same thing was true here.  The industry said that the risks of a rig ever sinking were zero. Their capacity to handle a spill up to 250,000 barrels per day was absolute.  None of it was true.  And so, if you allow this risk to be built into the system, then it's ordinary families' financial and health and well-being which is affected, and the government has to play the role of protecting ordinary people against the short-term financial goals of companies that are going to assure the public that everything is safe."
134,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But the political system wants compromise.  The president could have spent all of his time reforming the Mineral Management Service before calling for additional offshore drilling.  Now, that was in pursuit of a larger climate bill.  He could have done that
first before calling for an expansion of drilling. "
135,"John Hofmeister, the reality is, what is true is that there are more than 14,000 deep well drills around the world.  It is also true it is almost unprecedented for this kind of problem to arise.  The problem is when it does arise, it's--we're watching--almost impossible to solve.  What is
the role of industry to better manage the risk?"
136,"MR. HOFMEISTER:  David, I just published a book called ""Why We Hate the Oil Companies."" Just came out a few weeks ago.  And in that book I lay out what the fundamental problem is as I see it.  The industry is in business for itself.  The government has promised energy independence to the American people through eight presidents and 18 Congresses.  We are
no further ahead today than we were when President Nixon first used the word in 1973.  The issue that we have to come up with is we have to stop ad hocking our way into the future.  We can't ad hoc to everything, and that's what we've been doing. We need a fundamental plan that starts with a zero to 10-year outlook, a 10- to 25-year outlook and 25 beyond. Nobody's ever done that.  This nation has done all kinds of things with its space program.  It's had accidents, but the space program has been fantastic because they have this long-term view.  We have taken energy as an ad hoc system, and we have just taken one bit at a time.  The industry is fragmented.  There's no such thing as an energy industry.  It's fragmented into bits and pieces--oil and gas, coal, renewables, geothermal, you name it, and it's all broken up into bits. They're not going to solve the problem.  The solution is a government-led plan that
goes through administrations, through Democratic majorities and Republican majorities.  And if we can't do that, then we're going to be sitting here--and President Obama's going to have a real problem with the moratorium when the price of gasoline skyrockets."
137,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Well, to the--to that point, Governor, what's worse, the moratorium or the effects of this spill on the region?  And I talk about the moratorium on offshore drilling."
138,"GOV. BARBOUR:  Well, the moratorium.  The skill--the spill's a terrible thing, but the moratorium is a, is a terrible thing that's not only bad for the region, it's bad for America.  Thirty percent of the oil produced in the United States comes out of the Gulf of Mexico, and 80 percent of
that is from deepwater drilling.  So that's a fourth of all of our oil. As, as John may have said or somebody said, this is going to drive the price of energy up. Now, there are people like Congressman Markey whose bill in Congress, the--that mostly effects electricity, would drive up, up energy costs.  As President Obama said, under--he told a San Francisco paper, and I quote, ""Under my cap and trade plan, electricity rates will necessarily skyrocket."" One of the things President Obama and I agree on. This moratorium is going to have the same sort of effect."
139,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
140,"GOV. BARBOUR:  These--as somebody said, these drilling--I think it was Mary Landrieu--these drilling rigs are going to leave and they're not coming back in six months."
141,MR. GREGORY:  Con--all right.
142,"GOV. BARBOUR:  They're going to be off the shore of west Africa, Brazil. And, and the American people are going to pay the price because it means..."
143,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, response..."
144,GOV. BARBOUR:  ...more imported oil.
145,"MR. GREGORY:  This issue of a broader climate change bill, a price for the amount of carbon used by companies, is the governor wrong, Congressman?"
146,"REP. MARKEY:  The governor is wrong.  And the governor is using something that then Senator Obama said three years ago, not the Waxman-Markey Bill along with senator--along with Speaker Pelosi that we passed through the House last year.  What we do is we create a, a program of market-based incentives so that we move towards wind and solar, towards geothermal, towards biomass, towards plug-in hybrids, towards all-electric vehicles; efficiency, doubling the efficiency of the homes and the, and the buildings that we work in; moving in a way that captures the innovation, captures the science lead that we have on the rest of our country.  And over time it will actually lead to lower electricity, lower energy bills
for our country.  We only have 2 percent of the oil reserves in the world, and we consume 25 percent of the world's oil on a daily basis. That is nonsustainable.  Either we have this technological revolution going forward while we keep the oil and gas and coal that we have, but unless we unleash this market-based revolution and make it possible for us to back out the oil from OPEC, make sure China isn't selling all of these new products to us..."
147,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
148,REP. MARKEY:  ...and creating two million jobs here...
149,MR. GREGORY:  But...
150,REP. MARKEY:  ...then we will have made an historic mistake.
151,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator, Senator, you are a Gulf state senator."
152,SEN. LANDRIEU:  Yes.
153,MR. GREGORY:  You are for lifting the moratorium.
154,SEN. LANDRIEU:  Yes.
155,"MR. GREGORY:  And you want that oil drilling.  But here's a statement you put out on Tuesday speaking about the future, and it was very interesting.  You wrote, ""Oil has paid tremendous dividends to our country.  It helped us win World War II, it helped create an industrial
revolution, and it built the greatest middle class the world has ever seen.  But its time has come and is moving past us, and the transition to clean renewable energy is one our country has to begin immediately."""
156,SEN. LANDRIEU:  I agree with that.
157,MR. GREGORY:  Is there the political will...
158,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  Not only I agree with it, I said that and..."
159,"MR. GREGORY:  You said it, so I think..."
160,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  Yes, I said it and I not only agree with it, I wrote it."
161,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but, but is there--but, but is, but is there the political will to really make that change?"
162,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  I think that there is growing political will.  I want to say, although I don't support the bill that came out of Ed Markey's committee--but I have the greatest respect for him--that I do believe that we can have a sustainable, cleaner future.  But I want to go back to two points then I'll come back."
163,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
164,"SEN. LANDRIEU:  One, part of the--your issue about beating up on the companies, yes, there's been a lot of that.  But we also have to look in the mirror to the regulators of this industry.  Half the Congress has wanted to sort of let the industry do whatever it wants.  Obviously, that
was a mistake. And the other half of the Congress wants to kill the oil and gas industry so badly they don't really take the time to regulate them well.  And I'm hoping that both sides of the aisle can come together, recognize this is a vital industry.  We need it for right now. We may not need it in 50 years from now or 30 years from now, Ed, or 25 years.  But we need it now, and so we've got to regulate it correctly, make BP accountable for everything, and then think about building a future where we can rely less on fossil fuels.  And if we do it right,
even the oil and gas industry has been sending signals that if it's done correctly with the right transitions, and natural gas can be that bridge..."
165,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
166,SEN. LANDRIEU:  ...to wind and solar in the future.
167,"MR. GREGORY:  Katty, we only have about 20 seconds left, but look at the enormity of the challenge, we put it up on our screen, in terms of our use and dependence on oil.  The United States--put it on the screen--uses nearly 20 million barrels of oil a day.  That's how much we consume.  We blow everybody else away on that.  That's the challenge."
168,"MS. KAY:  That's the challenge, and the new challenge is for government to regulate an industry that is ahead of it technologically.  Whether it is in finance, whether it is in bioethics, whether it is in oil, it is the industries that are ahead of the regulators.  And for regulators to
keep on top of industry is an increasingly difficult problem."
169,"MR. GREGORY:  I'm going to make that the last word.  Thank you all very much for a thoughtful and, I hope, constructive discussion."
170,We'll be right back after this brief station break.

6,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
7,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Three hundred and eleven soldiers have died this year in Afghanistan, the latest just yesterday by an improvised explosive device in the south of the country.  For coalition forces, June is now by far the deadliest of any month since the war began in late 2001.  At the G-8 summit in Toronto yesterday, President Obama; the new British prime
minister, David Cameron; and other world leaders agreed to set a timetable of five years for withdrawal of military forces from Afghanistan.  This as The New York Times reports this morning about growing concern inside Afghanistan over President Karzai's efforts to negotiate with the Taliban and bring members of the insurgency into a power sharing agreement with the Afghan government.  Here with us live from Kabul this morning, our chief foreign correspondent, Richard Engel. "
8,"Richard, I want to start with that story in The New York Times and this concern about efforts to reconcile the Taliban, America's enemy in Afghanistan, with the Afghan government.  Will this be job one, do you think, for General Petraeus when he comes there?"
9,"MR. RICHARD ENGEL:  I think it probably will be.  There is a growing consensus on the ground that there is no military solution to this conflict. And we've heard General Petraeus say that time and time again about Iraq and also about this war here.  And President Karzai has made
it very clear he wants a peace deal, and order--in order to do that he has been reaching out to the Pakistani government.  Now, Afghans are very concerned that the United States will just sell the country to Pakistan and make a very significant deal with the Taliban and other insurgent groups that will leave other ethnic minority groups out in the cold. They don't want the Taliban to come back to power."
10,"MR. GREGORY:  Richard, you report on our soldiers on the front lines. You know the political and the military situation there.  What's the impact of the firing of General McChrystal having on all of that? "
11,"MR. ENGEL:  It was a shock to most of the troops, but now they have embraced it and they'd like to see changes.  General Petraeus has a very good reputation, he's associated with success in Iraq, and they hope that will bring--that will come here as well.  The number one concern that soldiers express to me is the rules of engagement.  They feel that they
don't have the adequate tools to defend themselves, that under General McChrystal it became too difficult to fight back against the Taliban. That will be the number one concern that soldiers would have and the thing they would to change most under David Petraeus."
12,"MR. GREGORY:  Richard Engel in Kabul for us this morning, thank you very much."
13,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Joining us now, ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona. "
14,"Senator, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS."
15,"SEN. JOHN McCAIN (R-AZ):  Thank you, David."
16,"MR. GREGORY:  So much to discuss, and I want to get to the strategy, the withdrawal timetable and all of it with you.  But first I want to talk about General McChrystal.  The president fired him this week, and he spoke to the nation about it.  This is in part what he said."
17,"(Videotape, Wednesday)"
18,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  The conduct represented in the recently published article does not meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general. It undermines the civilian control of the military that is at the core of our democratic system, and it erodes the trust that's necessary for our team to work together to achieve our objectives in Afghanistan."
19,(End videotape)
20,MR. GREGORY:  Did the president do the right thing?
21,"SEN. McCAIN:  Yes, he did, and he took the appropriate steps, in my view. I would like to say, in General McChrystal's behalf, that he played a key role in Iraq in the efforts against al-Qaeda.  A lot of this is not known and will--may never be known.  But General McChrystal did a great job there.  The president took appropriate action, and we wish General McChrystal well in the future."
22,MR. GREGORY:  Was this an important leadership moment for the commander in chief?
23,"SEN. McCAIN:  Yes.  Yes, I think that the president realized that this was an important moment, and he made the right decision. "
24,MR. GREGORY:  What was...
25,"SEN. McCAIN:  Again, I..."
26,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
27,"SEN. McCAIN:  You know, your question's what were they thinking?"
28,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.  Well, that's exactly right.  What was--and not only what was he thinking, was this foolishness?  Was it naivety about the press?  Or was there something real here, Senator, about frustration with the policy, frustration with the civilian side of the policy, frustration with how much progress he thought was being made vs. what was expected of him?"
29,"SEN. McCAIN:  First of all, there's no excuse for it, OK?  There's no excuse for it.  But part of it, some of it was frustration.  Part of it was a group of officers who find themselves with a night off which they did not expect, having been working 24/7 in Kabul.  They went out in a
social environment. And I must tell you that as a young Navy pilot that on occasion at happy hour some things were said about our commanding officer that maybe we wouldn't want to be held responsible for.  But that does not excuse anything.  But it certainly maybe understands the--makes people understand the circumstances a little better.  But, overall, you just, you just can't do those things, and we expect our officer corps to have the maturity to realize that."
30,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk about the fight ahead, then, and I want to get your assessment of how the war is going.  And let me set this up a little bit. This is The Economist magazine on newsstands now, and here's the cover: ""Losing Afghanistan."" It says, ""The war after McChrystal."" The New York Times on Thursday reported the challenging environment that General Petraeus will go into:  ""At the moment, every aspect of the war in Afghanistan is going badly: the military's campaign in the strategic city of Kandahar has met with widespread resistance from the Afghan public; President Karzai is proving erratic and unpredictable; and the Taliban are resisting more tenaciously than ever."" How's it going?"
31,"SEN. McCAIN:  I think that that's a fairly accurate description of the situation in Afghanistan.  I think that it's pretty obvious that the effort in Marjah did not achieve the elements of success certainly quickly enough.  The offensive into Kandahar has been delayed--which, by
the way, argues against this setting a date certain for beginning the withdrawal.  A lot of the behavior that Karzai is displaying, a lot of the things that are going on right now are a direct result of the president's commitment to beginning withdrawal--whatever not turn ""out the lights"" means.  That's an indecipherable statement.  Rahm Emanuel on your program last, last Sunday reiterated the commitment to leaving middle of 2011.  The president's spokesperson said, ""It's etched in stone, and he has the chisel."" So people in the region, they can't leave.
They have to adjust and they have to accommodate.  And Karzai is doing some of the things he's doing because he's not confident that we're going to stay.  The troops on the ground are, are in some ways confused about what the long-term strategy would be.  And I guess the best example I can tell you is a high-ranking Taliban prisoner said, ""You've got the watches, and we've got the time."" And that's what is, is pervading this entire environment, the fact that they think we're--that we're going to leave.  And if they believe that, then they are going to act very differently."
32,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator, we have been there 104 months.  This is a longer war--longest war in U.S. history, longer than Vietnam.  We've shown a lot of staying power here without a lot of results.  And my question is whether, you know, perception outpaces reality.  Is it that
you've got a central government in Afghanistan, led by Hamid Karzai, who basically is making, you know, side deals here with the Pakistanis and is trying to cut us out because he just doesn't think that, ultimately, we can succeed because he can look at the history of his own country and see for centuries they have repelled foreign invaders and, and foreign interference."
33,"SEN. McCAIN:  Well, first of all, it is the longest war, and the loss of any life is tragic.  We've lost--just went over, tragically, the thousand mark. We lost 58,000 in the war in Vietnam.  I think that perspective is important. Second of all, Karzai is acting like he is, as I said, because
he is beginning to accommodate for a situation where he finds himself with Americans withdrawing.  Third of all, we need a better team and coordination between the military and civilian side.  We all know that. But I am also convinced that David Petraeus, who is one of the greatest outstanding leaders in American history, I think, can bring this to a successful conclusion.  But we have to convince the enemy that we are going to do what's necessary to succeed, and that's why we were able to succeed in Iraq."
34,"MR. GREGORY:  I have a question that keeps nagging me about the enemy, about the Taliban."
35,SEN. McCAIN:  Yeah.
36,"MR. GREGORY:  The United States is engaged in working with the Afghan central government to recruit Afghan soldiers.  Why do we have to recruit Afghan soldiers?  Who's training the Taliban?  Nobody has to recruit them.  They're out there fighting for, you know, what they see as a future.  Which is, by the way, is a dark, terrorist, annihilist future. Nevertheless, they don't have to be recruited, and yet we're in this position where we're trying to recruit Afghan soldiers."
37,"SEN. McCAIN:  You know, that's a very good question.  And it's clear that the Taliban is a very extremist and very fanatical element, and I think this is true with all insurgencies.  But I think you also find that the majority of the people in Afghanistan do not want the return of the
Taliban.  They're afraid, though, that when the United States leaves that there will be assassination squads going around and taking care of those who cooperated with the government and the Americans.  Look, Karzai is not doing the things we want him to do.  I don't think there's any doubt about that in many respects. Maliki was not doing the things we wanted..."
38,MR. GREGORY:  In Iraq.
39,"SEN. McCAIN:  ...us to do.  He was perceived as very weak.  The level of sectarian violence in Iraq makes what's going on in Afghanistan pale in comparison, and I'm not saying it's not going to be long and hard and tough, and I'm not saying that it's going to be easy.  And I--but I am
convinced of one thing, you--fundamental of warfare, you tell the enemy when you're leaving, that--then they will wait.  And Ho Chi Minh certainly is an authentication of that, of that course of action."
40,MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk about this issue of a withdrawal deadline because you're very concerned about it.  And let me take everybody through it.  Back in December of 2009 this is what the president told the 
41,country.
42,"(Videotape, December 1, 2009)"
43,"PRES. OBAMA:  I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.  After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home."
44,(End videotape)
45,"MR. GREGORY:  So they're surging up now, so a year from now they begin to come home."
46,"They won't even be at full fighting force until the fall, so they'll be fighting at full strength for less than a year.  Now, Vice President Biden, interviewed by Jonathan Alter, as you well know, in the book, ""The Promise,"" said to Alter this.  ""In July of 2011 you're going to see a whole lot of people moving out.  `Bet on it,' Biden said as he wheeled to leave the room, late for lunch with the president.  He turned at the door and said once more, `Bet.  On.  It.'"" Seems pretty clear. Yet, yet, Senator, General Petraeus testifying just about 10 days ago on Capitol Hill, seemed to be more skeptical about that.  Here's what he said."
47,"(Videotape, June 16, 2010)"
48,"GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS:  Keep in mind that July 2011, in the first place, is based on projections made all the way back last fall during the decision-making process, and so again I think--I--we would not make too much out of that."
49,(End videotape)
50,"MR. GREGORY:  ""Would not make too much out of"" it.  Do you think July 2011 as the beginning of a transition could move?  Could that timetable move?"
51,"SEN. McCAIN:  Look, I, I'm against a timetable.  In wars, you declare when you're leaving after you've succeeded.  And, by the way, no military adviser recommended to the president that he set a date of the middle of 2011.  So it was purely a political decision, not one based on facts on the ground, not based on military strategy or anything.  Now..."
52,"MR. GREGORY:  All--Senator, is that fair?  All of his military advisers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Petraeus, General McChrystal, they all signed onto the idea..."
53,SEN. McCAIN:  They signed onto it...
54,"MR. GREGORY:  ...of July.  2011.  Well, isn't it their obligation to
say..."
55,SEN. McCAIN:  It's not their idea.
56,MR. GREGORY:  ...that this is wrong?
57,SEN. McCAIN:  In my view it is.
58,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, they didn't do that, though."
59,SEN. McCAIN:  In my view it is.  They didn't.
60,MR. GREGORY:  So they were for it.
61,"SEN. McCAIN:  They didn't do it.  They didn't do it, and they should have because they know better.  But the point is that General Petraeus is put in an almost untenable position here.  If he says it's ""conditions-based,"" which it should be that, then he is not going directly against the president.  But if he says directly what the president said and what you just quoted Vice President Biden say, then obviously he is supporting a strategy that he feels that we all know
can't win.  So what, what do we need?  We need the president just to come out and say, ""Look, this is condition-based and condition-based only.  We will leave tomorrow if the conditions are--allow for it.  But we're not going to set an arbitrary date for withdrawal."" That's all he has to say because, believe me, the Taliban are not able to parse difference
comments by different people the way that you just described different commentaries."
62,MR. GREGORY:  But...
63,SEN. McCAIN:  They need to have a clear signal that we are staying.
64,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator, you have said before that 18 months was an appropriate time horizon to, to realistically assess how we're doing in the war..."
65,SEN. McCAIN:  Absolutely.
66,MR. GREGORY:  ...and perhaps change the strategy.
67,SEN. McCAIN:  But December...
68,"MR. GREGORY:  So at what point should we look at what's happening and say, ""This isn't working""?"
69,SEN. McCAIN:  There's going to be a review in December.
70,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
71,"SEN. McCAIN:  I think there should be constant reviews.  And that review, by the way, will show that we have not seen the pace of success.  And, by the way, we have not seen our allies contribute the 10,000 troops that were part of this overall strategy of 40,000 troops that would be engaged in this surge. But I am for constant review.  That's different from
saying, ""We will begin a withdrawal,"" OK? "
72,MR. GREGORY:  But we...
73,SEN. McCAIN:  We may need more troops.  We may need more as we did...
74,MR. GREGORY:  But did we do that in Iraq?  Didn't we set a timetable...
75,SEN. McCAIN:  After.
76,MR. GREGORY:  ...after we surged up...
77,"SEN. McCAIN:  After we succeeded, after we were succeeding, yes indeed. And we should."
78,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think we'll be more--do we think we need more troops in Afghanistan?
79,"SEN. McCAIN:  I don't know.  But I, I think that there--it's clearly there's a shortfall from the 10,000 we expected to get from our allies. And, again, I know that we can succeed and we can withdraw.  But to--again, you cannot sound an uncertain trumpet.  No one follows an
uncertain trumpet."
80,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator, to challenge that I spoke to White House officials this week who said, ""Wait a minute, the withdrawal timetable means a beginning of a process."" And by the way, there will still be more forces fighting in Afghanistan properly resourced, even when the
transition begins than there ever were in the history of this conflict starting in 2001.  Isn't that important?"
81,"SEN. McCAIN:  Well then, let's have the president of the United States stand up and say, ""It's conditions-based.  We will not withdraw a single troop unless we think it's necessary to do so, and we may even add troops if we think it's necessary to do so."" Let's hear that.  That sends a message to our friends and enemies alike, and I guarantee you it would have a significant impact on our enemies and friends alike. "
82,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you get troubled when people come up to you, and I talk to people as well, who say, ""You know, what is it exactly we are fighting for? It just doesn't seem clear.  This is like Vietnam.  I don't know what the endgame is here."" Do we have a clear achievable objective in Afghanistan?"
83,"SEN. McCAIN:  Oh, I think clearly the goal is that Afghanistan does not return to a base for attacks on the United States and our allies. Clearly, that is a strategy which means you have governmental control, you have the support of the people, you have a relatively stable
environment, realizing it'll be long and hard and difficult.  And also look at the consequences of failure in Iraq and the consequences in the region.  They are significant."
84,"MR. GREGORY:  What are the consequences of success?  Tom Friedman wrote in his column this week something very poignant, and I'll put it up on the screen.  ""What do we win if we win?  At least in Iraq, if we eventually produce a decent democratizing government, we will, at
enormous cost, have changed the politics in a great Arab capital in the heart of the Arab Muslim world.  That can have wide resonance.  Change Afghanistan at enormous cost and you've changed Afghanistan-period. Afghanistan does not resonate."""
85,"SEN. McCAIN:  Well, I have the greatest respect for Tom Ridge, I think both books..."
86,MR. GREGORY:  Tom Friedman.
87,"SEN. McCAIN:  Excuse me, I'm sorry, Tom Ricks I have the greatest respect for."
88,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
89,"SEN. McCAIN:  Mr. Friedman was wrong about Iraq.  He said we couldn't succeed in Iraq.  He said we'd fail, we had to withdraw.  Enough said. "
90,"MR. GREGORY:  The question still stands, though.  What do you win if you win? How does it resonate?"
91,"SEN. McCAIN:  What you win, what you win is stability in the region, you win a reduction in the threat of radical Islamic extremism, you win the elimination of a goal for attacks on the United States of America. Clearly, Taliban and al-Qaeda would be working together if we were able
to succeed. And you don't send a message of an American defeat, which would reverberate throughout the region and the world.  And, again, I am confident with the right kind of military and civilian team in Kabul that we can succeed, and it's going to be long and it's hard and it's tough. But..."
92,MR. GREGORY:  Do we stick it out at any cost?
93,"SEN. McCAIN:  ...you know--and I sound, I sound a little tough to you. But I just talked..."
94,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
95,"SEN. McCAIN:  ...on the phone to a young man named Todd Nicely, quadruple amputee.  I met him at Walter Reed, and he's now at Bethesda.  I'm, I'm not prepared to say that--to these young men and women who are putting their lives and their families on the line that we are going to leave it at a date certain, which means we are pursuing a strategy that I think is
doomed to failure.  We owe it to their families. "
96,MR. GREGORY:  So how long is too long?  Do we stick into it forever?
97,"SEN. McCAIN:  It's, it's gauge--no, no.  It's, it's again, like other counterinsurgencies, and this is a counterinsurgency based on the same principles but very different conditions than we had in Iraq.  And that means that gradually we will clear, hold, make the people that support
the government and against the Taliban, which they already are, an Afghan army--and, by the way, they are very excellent fighters that is functioning, and the corruption is a huge problem.  You and I could spend the rest of the program going over a list of the problems."
98,MR. GREGORY:  Sure.
99,"SEN. McCAIN:  Number one being the corruption situation in Afghanistan. But we can succeed there, and it is in our vital national interest to do so.  And the consequences of failure are catastrophic in my view. "
100,"MR. GREGORY:  Before I let you go, I want to get you on..."
101,SEN. McCAIN:  Sure.
102,"MR. GREGORY:  ...another piece of news, and that is tomorrow Elena Kagan begins her hearings to be the next Supreme Court justice.  Back in 2008, you laid out a standard for evaluating such nominees, and, and you explained why you supported President Clinton's nominees to the High Court.  Let me play that for you."
103,"(Videotape, May 6, 2008)"
104,"SEN. McCAIN:  ...for the simple reason, the simple reason that the nominees were qualified.  And it would have been petty and partisan and disingenuous to insist otherwise.  It's part of the discipline of democracy to respect the roles and responsibilities of each branch of
government, and above all, to respect the verdicts of elections and judgment of the people."
105,(End videotape)
106,MR. GREGORY:  Based on that standard...
107,SEN. McCAIN:  Eloquent.
108,"MR. GREGORY:  Right, right.  Based on that standard, will you support the nomination of Elena Kagan?"
109,"SEN. McCAIN:  I want to look at--watch the hearings.  The hearings, I think, are always very important.  But I'll tell you one thing I'm disturbed about was her obvious steadfast and even zealous opposition to military recruiters, to the presence of military on the campus of the
most prestigious university, in, in the view of many, in America.  That's disturbing to me."
110,MR. GREGORY:  Is that disqualifying?
111,"SEN. McCAIN:  I--we--as I say, I want to watch the hearings and let the process go forward.  But it is very disturbing."
112,MR. GREGORY:  Is immigration reform in a comprehensive way possible this year or in this term?
113,"SEN. McCAIN:  Not until we get the borders secure.  By the way, on that issue, why is it that Phoenix, Arizona, is the number two kidnapping capital of the world?  Does that mean our border's safe?  Of course not. Why is it that the police chief in Nogales reported that his police
officers are being told they're going to be murdered by the drug cartels on the other side of the border?  The, the rise of violence and the influence of the drug cartels and the human smugglers have made our government put up signs in the southern part of the state of Arizona
warning them that they are in a drug smuggling and human smuggling area of this country.  That's not, that's not how America should... "
114,MR. GREGORY:  Do you agree with the governor of Arizona who says that most people who come across the border illegally are actually drug mules?
115,"SEN. McCAIN:  No.  I think that there's a large number and I think she's right in that the drug cartels movement has dramatically increased and the violence.  Twenty-three thousand people, Mexicans, have been killed in the last three years in Mexico."
116,"MR. GREGORY:  Do those kinds of comments make the debate harder, make it, you know, a hotter debate?"
117,"SEN. McCAIN:  I, I think the governor of Arizona has done a good job in this whole debate.  She--I may not agree with one sentence that she uses, but she's standing up for Arizona.  And, and I think that the people in my state deserve a better environment of security than the one they're getting from the federal government now, and a federal responsibility."
118,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Senator McCain, thank you, as always. Appreciate it."
119,"SEN. McCAIN:  Thanks for always for having me on, David."
120,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
121,"Coming up next, our special edition on Afghanistan continues:  THE FIGHT AHEAD.  What have we achieved?  What are we on a path to achieve in Afghanistan?  Is it mission impossible or is it victory?  Our roundtable weighs in:  Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee and author Sebastian Junger, Tom Ricks, combat veteran Wes Moore, and retired Army General Barry McCaffrey. Plus, a look back in our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE when another president clashed with his top general 59 years ago, only on MEET THE PRESS."
122,(Announcements)
123,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up, our special edition devoted to the war in Afghanistan continues.  After almost nine years in the fight, what is the way forward?  Is there an exit strategy?  The discussion continues after this brief commercial break."
124,(Announcements)
125,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We're back to continue our special edition AFGHANISTAN: THE FIGHT AHEAD.  And joining us now, author of the new book ""War,"" Sebastian Junger; author and retired U.S. Army Captain Wes Moore; senior fellow for the Center for A New American Security, Tom Ricks; Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee of the Foreign Affairs Committee;
and retired general and NBC military analyst Barry McCaffrey. "
126,Welcome to all of you.
127,REP. BARBARA LEE (D-CA):  Thank you.  Good to be here.
128,"MR. GREGORY:  This is, this is so important at a time when I think America is so grateful, and thankful for our fighting men and women in Afghanistan and the incredible sacrifices that, that they offer day in and day out.  The debate about the war still matters, and maybe too few
Americans are really engaged in it, and that's why we wanted to dedicate the time here."
129,"Congresswoman Lee, the most important aspect, I think, of this interview that I just did with Senator McCain is about when the troops come home. A year from now they're supposed to start coming out.  Now, the president was asked about that July 11 timetable, and this is what he said about it this week."
130,"(Videotape, Thursday)"
131,PRES. OBAMA:  We did not say that starting July 2011 suddenly there would be no troops from the United States or allied countries in Afghanistan. We didn't say we'd be switching off the lights and closing the door behind us. What we said is we'd begin a transition phase in which the Afghan government is taking on more and more responsibility.
132,(End videotape)
133,"MR. GREGORY:  Now, you heard Senator McCain say that's too opaque, that's too vague.  The president ought to really level with the country and say, ""We don't know how it's going to go.  We may need more troops."" Where do you come down?"
134,"REP. LEE:  Thank you, David.  Nearly a decade ago, the American people were told that we were going into Afghanistan to capture Osama bin Laden and to stop al-Qaeda.  At this point, we have to look at what has happened during that last 10 years.  Has our goal and mission been accomplished?  The reason I could not support giving then President Bush and any subsequent president a blank check to wage endless war was precisely because of what has happened. The American people, had they known that this would be the longest war in history, I think there would have been much more debate and discussion in Congress.  And there may
have been a three-hour discussion before this authorization was granted. I think we need an exit strategy, we need a plan, we need a, a way to begin to redeploy our young men and women out of harm's way, and we need to look at how to move forward."
135,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you think the president's backtracking when you hear him say, ""Hey, we never said we were just going to turn the lights out and leave""?"
136,"REP. LEE:  I think the public expects a review in December.  The public respects us to begin to end this in July of next year.  I, for one, do not believe that we should have even gone there.  Again, we have to remember why we went to Afghanistan."
137,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but my question, Congresswoman, do you believe the president was backtracking in those remarks?  A lot of people on the left were concerned about it."
138,"REP. LEE:  I hope the president is not backtracking.  I believe that the longer we stay in Iraq--excuse me, in Afghanistan, we're going to hear generals say, and come to us, say--and say, ""It may not be working.  We need more money, more time, more troops."" Or, if there's progress being made, we're going to hear the generals saying, ""We need more money, more troops, and a longer time frame."" So I believe that we need to stick with what the president initially said, and that is to begin to end this next July."
139,"MR. GREGORY:  General McCaffrey, Joe Klein is--for Time magazine, in his new piece--who's covered the strategy, covered the war extensively, wrote this this week:  ""Obama is going to have to be less coy with the public about what is really going to happen in July 2011, even if that risks alienated his party's vestigial anti-war base.  He is going to have to make it clear that `significant' troop withdrawals--a word bandied around in recent weeks--are not in the cards unless the situation on the ground changes dramatically, for good or for ill."""
140,"GEN. BARRY McCAFFREY (Ret.):  Sure.  Look, this is a political dilemma, not a military one.  There's 7,000 killed and wounded, $5.4 billion a month, the American people don't support the war.  We have a goofy, incompetent Afghan government.  We're trying to build an Afghan security force and get it largely done in a very short period of time.  None of this is going to work the way we're going about it.  So, again, back to, I think, the congresswoman's remarks, you either got to pull out in, in a stated time frame with huge negative consequences, potentially, to Pakistan, the Afghans themselves, U.S. foreign policy; or you, you
announce that we're in there until we have achieved a stable political system in Afghanistan."
141,"MR. GREGORY:  Wes Moore, what is the argument to be made in support of the president sticking--as they are doing.  I've spoken to White House officials, military officials; they're sticking to this July 2011 time frame.  They emphasize this is not a, you know, a time when everybody comes out, it's the beginning of a process and there will still be significant numbers of U.S. troops on the ground there."
142,"MR. WES MOORE:  Well, I think it's important to understand that we are going on close to 10 years.  But this war has not been a priority for close to 10 years.  I mean, in the time when I was over there, we had around--a little over 19,000 troops on the ground to cover a land mass
that is 50 percent larger than Iraq.  So this was never a large priority on the side.  And I think the problem is when you have second-tier priorities, you get second-tier results.  There, there is no one who wants us to redeploy more than me.  For every day for the past 10 years I
have either been in harm's way or had friends who have been in harm's way.  So I want--no one more than me wants this to end.  But we also understand the consequences and ramifications for having a pre-emptive pullout without any type of understanding or real comprehension of the conditions on the ground as well."
143,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you agree with what Senator McCain said, which is maybe the president needs to say, ""Look, we're properly resourcing the war.  I can't tell you how it ends by that point.  We may need more troops if we're going to get this done right.  We're in--we're in for 10 years almost, nine years.  We got to do it right."""
144,"MR. MOORE:  Well, I think the indication that we have right now is that the system that we have in place and the systems that we put in place over the past few years are actually starting to show some results.  We have a 30 percent increase in Afghan security force participation.  We now are finally seeing complete integration between the civilian side and
military side. These are important developments if we're going to see that type of progress in Afghanistan.  But I do think that the crucial thing to remember throughout all this is that the decisions on the ground and the conditions on the ground need to be the thing to help guide the policy."
145,MR. GREGORY:  I'm not sure we're having complete integration between the civilian and the military side in terms of what's happening on the ground there.  But we're going to return to that in just a minute.
146,MR. MOORE:  Yes.
147,"MR. GREGORY:  Sebastian, weigh in on that."
148,"MR. JUNGER:  I've been reporting from Afghanistan since '96, for the first 10 years of that, from the perspective of the civilian population. It's of incredible concern to me.  I mean, human--these are human rights watch figures.  Since NATO has been there, 16,000 Afghan civilians have died in combat operations.  It's a horrifying number.  That ended a period of violence in Afghanistan under the Taliban where 400,000 Afghans were killed.  So we really do need to assess the effect of pulling out on the Afghan people, first of all.  It's--people back here don't realize that.  I think that, you know, the left--and I'm, I'm left wing--when they talk about withdrawal, their concern is the humanitarian impacts of war.  But they do not remember the '90s."
149,"MR. GREGORY:  And let's remember something.  The news of the day today is that the ethnic minorities in Afghanistan are really worried that you've got a Pashtun leader in Hamid Karzai who's going to negotiate with the Taliban, bring them into the government, the same Taliban government that terrorized women, that terrorized the Hazaris and other ethnic minorities, Tajiks and others.  There could be a civil war once we pull out."
150,"Tom Ricks, with that as a potential backdrop, I also want you to address the news of this week, McChrystal out, Petraeus in.  What does this week mean to where we are?"
151,"MR. TOM RICKS:  Well, the first thing is you've got to have Pashtun participation in the government in Kabul.  I lived in Afghanistan as a kid, and one thing that you take away from that is Afghanistan is only stable when Pashtuns are in Kabul as part of power."
152,"What does it mean for McChrystal going to go?  McChrystal had to go.  It just is a matter of military discipline.  You can't let a general get away with stuff you wouldn't let a captain get away with.  What struck me this week was political Washington didn't really get it; military
Washington totally did. They knew that McChrystal was toast on Tuesday morning.  So there's a feeling that Obama did exactly the right thing. But Obama's now got himself a new general, Petraeus, and there are big differences between Iraq and Afghanistan. And there's also big
differences between presidents.  Obama has taken no strategic risk in Afghanistan or Iraq.  He has held it at arm's length, almost like, ""Hey, I inherited these two wars from my idiot predecessors.  They're not my problem."""
153,"MR. GREGORY:  Surging up 30,000 troops is no strategic risk?"
154,"MR. RICKS:  No.  You know, 30,000 troops is nothing in a country that size. A strategic risk would be the sort of things that Petraeus did in Afghanistan that I expect he might do with this president in Iraq.  He's going to ask this president to double down in some form--cutting deals
with the Taliban; giving Karzai ultimatums, ""Fella, either you do this or we withdraw support from you totally tomorrow morning.  You want to end up hanging from your heels from a streetlight in Kabul, keep it up, Karzai."" I think you're going to see a much tougher attitude taken towards the Afghan government.  But I've yet to see in Obama a real willingness to take those sort of risks, do something like, say, get rid of the entire team in Afghanistan and put in a new set of American officials."
155,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask a member of Congress here.  Congresswoman Lee, I mean, your views about the future of the war are clear.  You've made them clear here this morning.  Nevertheless, the strategy's going to move on with you or without you at this point.  My question is let's say we get farther along and General Petraeus says to, to President Obama, ""Hey, look, you wanted me in there to clean this up?  I need more time.  I need more troops.  In other words, I can't lose the troops that you want to pull out.  We've got to apply more pressure."" You think the president steps up, has the political capital to face down members of Congress like you, his liberal base, and say, ""You got to stick with me here""?"
156,"REP. LEE:  Quite frankly, there are many members of Congress now questioning this policy.  This debate is just beginning.  This is the debate that should have occurred nine years ago, David.  This debate is just beginning.  I think many of us, not only in the country, the
American people, but many of us recognize that our military occupation of Afghanistan really provides for a prime recruiting tool--as a prime recruiting tool for al-Qaeda.  And when you look at what our primary mission is there--of course, that's our national security--we have to ask
the question:  Does remaining in Afghanistan as occupiers in a Muslim country, does that create more terrorists?  Does that create more danger for our country or less danger?  And remember, again, our primary mission and goal is our own national security.  So I question this policy.  I think more members of Congress are beginning--and this is not just liberal and progressive members, these are many members who you never would have believed would have begun to question this.  The American people are war weary.  This is an endless war, and they want it to come to an end."
157,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
158,"MR. JUNGER:  Let me just jump in.  I was in Kabul in '01 after Kabul fell, after the Taliban were toppled.  I was getting hugged by Afghans because I was American, because they hated the Taliban so much. Ninety--I don't know who does these surveys, 90 percent of Afghans--after
9/11, in early '02, 90 percent of Afghans supported the U.S. military action that, that destroyed the Taliban.  So you really--the word occupation really is not accurate."
159,"GEN. McCAFFREY:  You know, I've been in and out of there from..."
160,REP. LEE:  But...
161,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
162,"GEN. McCAFFREY:  ...since the start of the war, and the--again, though, some of those polling numbers are suspect.  But, essentially, the Taliban are Pashtun.  The Pashtun are trying to regain control as a plurality but not majority of the country.  At the end of the day, they're going to have to be part of the solution.  But even among the Pashtun there is zero tolerance for return of a Taliban regime.  So we shouldn't misunderstand that.  These people were brutal, they're a threat, they're--and I think, at the end of the day, our consequences if we
withdraw, Sebastian's got it dead right, will be a catastrophe for the Afghan population.  That's the dilemma he faces, Obama. "
163,"MR. RICKS:  You know, Afghanistan's a very hard place.  It's the hardest environment I've ever seen in the world.  These are people who survive conditions that would kill any of us in a couple of days."
164,GEN. McCAFFREY:  Right.
165,"MR. RICKS:  I remember reading an interview with an Afghan villager.  The reporter said to him, ""What did you think of the Taliban vs. what did you think of the police sent by Kabul?"" He said, ""Well, the Taliban were pretty mean to us; they were pretty rough.  We didn't like them.  But
when the police from Kabul came, the first thing they did was take our little boys and rape them."" You've got to deal with this Afghan government.  Our biggest single problem in Afghanistan is not the Taliban.  They are a consequence of our problem.  Our problem in
Afghanistan is the Kabul government."
166,"MR. GREGORY:  And this gets to this overall point of whether this is mission impossible, Wes Moore.  We have a counterinsurgency strategy which says, primarily, you don't just kill bad guys, you protect the good guys, you protect the population.  Can you have a counterinsurgency strategy that works if you have a host government that believes: A,
corruption is better than a straight arrow, stealing elections is better than winning it the old-fashioned way, and that, ""Hey, you know what? The U.S. is not really here for the long haul, so I'm going to make a bunch of side deals with the enemy of America, the Taliban, and the
Pakistanis, who in many ways, just want to play two sides against each other, make sure they protect themselves and their concerns about India. "
167,"MR. MOORE:  Let me tell you, it's incredibly important to work on increased transparency with the Afghan government, but it's also important to recognize the limitations of the Afghan government.  Now, this is a country that is very fragmented and is very tribal.  And, you know, we--one of the things we did--I was with a team in Afghanistan, you go out and you give out gifts to people. And one of the things that we would, we would give out to some of the tribal leaders were cutout--were maps, which were cutouts of Afghanistan.  And literally, the most popular question we got was, ""What is this?"" And we'd say, ""It's your country."" Their
understanding of Afghanistan as a whole is a very difficult one for Afghans to understand.  So the importance of actually being--to be able to go into rural areas, being able to work with a tribal--you know, with the tribal chieftains becomes extraordinarily important as to how we
advance and understand the limitations for--of a national government, who, in many cases, particularly in people that--in places that I was, they don't even understand who President Karzai is, or who the national government or what their job is."
168,"MR. GREGORY:  The, the goals, though, Sebastian Junger, go back to something that President Obama said on this program last September.  Goal number one, Congressman Lee just referred to it, stop al-Qaeda.  Make sure that Afghanistan is not a place where al-Qaeda launches attacks against the United States from Afghanistan or to our European partners. And he continued.  Let me show a portion of that."
169,"(Videotape, September 20, 2009)"
170,"PRES. OBAMA:  If supporting the Afghan national government and building capacity for their army and securing certain provinces advances that strategy, then we'll move forward.  But if it doesn't, then I'm not interested in just being in Afghanistan for the sake of being in
Afghanistan or saving face or in some way, you know, sending a message that America is here for, for the duration."
171,(End videotape)
172,"MR. GREGORY:  If we're really just fighting al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda's not there. The most dangerous aspect of al-Qaeda is the Haqqani network, which is supported in some fashion by Pakistan, operating in the tribal region on the border.  And yet we hear about the enemy being the Taliban. Are we clear on who we're fighting?"
173,"REP. LEE:  David, General..."
174,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah, yeah."
175,"REP. LEE:  ...Jones actually indicated that, I believe, less than 100 members of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.  You look at Somalia, you look at Yemen, this is, this is a global operation.  They're not going to deal with al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda's not in a cave in Afghanistan.  We've got to remember that.  And so, as we look at how we move forward, Congress, first of all, has to have this debate.  Secondly, we do have to develop an exit strategy and a timeline and begin to bring our young men and women home."
176,"MR. JUNGER:  But let's remember some history here.  Al-Qaeda was in Afghanistan when they attacked on 9/11.  They're in Pakistan right now because we're in Afghanistan.  And, if we pulled out, what they have is what they had before 9/11.  They have--I mean, when they're in
Pakistan, they're in the tribal territories.  It's not a--it's not an area that's connected very well to the rest of the world.  In Afghanistan, they had an airport, they had an economy, and they had a failed state that had no extradition treaties with the rest of the world. So they can do what they want, and there is no way to get at them short of military force.  So we pull out of--you're right, they're in Pakistan, but we pull out, they're going to be right back in Afghanistan. They have not attacked the West successfully since they had to vacate Afghanistan."
177,"MR. GREGORY:  Tom Ricks, go ahead."
178,"MR. RICKS:  I would agree with that.  I think if you want an endless war, Congresswoman, leave Afghanistan right now, and you'll find us having to go after al-Qaeda again and again there for decades."
179,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Tom, the president has made it clear that we are not going to be in an endless war.  He said to West Point, December 2009, we can't afford to have an open-ended commitment.  I mean, it seems pretty clear, unless he's going to change his mind, which he might, that we're going to have to close the chapter on this and leave, which seems like
everybody on the ground gets it and is acting accordingly. "
180,"REP. LEE:  David, our young men and women..."
181,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, hold on, hold on."
182,MR. RICKS:  Yeah.
183,MR. GREGORY:  I want to just let Tom respond to this.
184,"MR. RICKS:  Yeah.  It reminds me of something Ryan Crocker, the ambassador in Iraq, used to say, ""Just because you walk out of a movie doesn't mean it's over."" Just because you walk out of Afghanistan doesn't mean it's over.  We're all sick of the war in Afghanistan.  Nobody's
sicker than the U.S. military. I actually think one reason McChrystal blew up on the launching pad was because he and his guys are tired. They've been doing this for years.  The U.S. military is one percent of this country, and it's carrying 99 percent of the burden of the war.  You got to figure out a way to deal with Afghanistan. Look, a schedule is not going to get you there.  But even if you left tomorrow morning, Afghanistan would still be there, the problems would still be there, al-Qaeda would still be playing around in the region.  You've got to have
some--fine, leave tomorrow morning, but you then have got to figure out what you're going to do the day after."
185,"MR. GREGORY:  I just want to focus on troops for a moment here.  Our terrific foreign correspondent Richard Engel, who we heard from, has been--spent a lot of time with our troops of the 82nd Airborne, he was out with them recently, and did an incredible interview with a Sergeant Louis Loftus with the 82nd, who had lost a colleague, a fallen comrade, and he--Richard talked to him about that, and I wanted to show you a portion of that interview."
186,(Videotape)
187,"SGT. LOUIS LOFTUS:  I'm kind of numb to it.  Like to be honest, I just don't really feel much.  I, I, I, I pray for his family, I pray for his soul that, you know.  Yet, you see, I try not to think about it because when you think about it, then I get like this, and it's not--you know, I don't--yeah.  So, yeah.  You know, everyone deals with it their own way. I try to hide it.  I try not to think about it because I got to stay 100 percent.  You know, I got to, I got to keep a good example for the other soldiers.  I'm sorry."
188,(End videotape)
189,"MR. GREGORY:  And God bless our soldiers for, for doing that.  But, Sebastian, how do they process this?  You've been out there with them. The debate in Washington, nine years, almost.  How are they doing?"
190,"MR. JUNGER:  In the field?  They don't process it.  They process it as little as possible because that increases the risk to themselves.  They process it later.  There were guys who literally said, I--you know, I asked one guy, ""Are you scared out here?"" I mean, they--they're--my--the unit I was with was in 500 firefights during their deployment, right? ""Are you scared out here?"" And he said, ""No, not at all.  It's actually kind of strange."" It came later after they came home.  I think that's always been the case in war.  It's not particular to this war; that's
what combat is."
191,"MR. GREGORY:  General, how does it--we just about--we have a little over a minute left.  General, how--and then congressman, too, how does this end?"
192,"GEN. McCAFFREY:  Well, first of all, you know, just to, to remind people, it's 46,000 killed and wounded in one of the smallest armies since 1939. I just gave an award to a dad whose son got the Silver Star.  He wasn't there to receive it himself because he was back in Afghanistan on his sixth combat tour.  So, at the end of the day--Tom Ricks' superb article this morning in The Washington Post captured a lot of this--our way out is build Afghan security forces.  Lieutenant General Bill Caldwell is on the ground, Petraeus is going to go in, he's got to build the police force and an Afghan army that can maintain internal order.  We don't have the political will to stay with this much longer."
193,"REP. LEE:  I'm the daughter of a military officer, and I know the sacrifices these families are making.  Our troops have served brilliantly, they're brave, they've done everything we've asked them to do.  Let's face it, Congress--if Congress allows it, we're going to have an endless war, so it's time to begin to look at an exit strategy, a timeline, and to begin to safely redeploy our young men and women out of Afghanistan and begin to look at how we ensure our national security."
194,"MR. GREGORY:  Twenty seconds, Tom.  How does it end?"
195,"MR. RICKS:  I don't think it does.  I think we have landed in the middle of the Middle East, for better or worse, in a way that none of us expected us to. I think the war in Afghanistan was made much worse by the distracting war in Iraq, which never should have happened.  But we are dealing with phenomena in the Middle East that's going to be crucial to this country as long as we're dependent on Middle East oil.  So the best exit strategy I can think of is emphasize alternative fuels."
196,"MR. MOORE:  Hear, hear."
197,MR. JUNGER:  Amen.
198,"MR. GREGORY:  We will--we'll leave it there.  Thank you all very much. We're going to continue our discussion with author Sebastian Junger in our MEET THE PRESS Take Two Web extra.  You can also read an excerpt from his gripping book called ""War"" and find updates from me throughout the week.  It's all on our Web site, mtp.msnbc.com."
199,"And up next, our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE.  Nearly six decades ago, President Truman clashed with his top general, Douglas MacArthur, and the result caused a firestorm here in Washington.  We'll be right back after this brief station break."
200,(Announcements)
201,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  And we are back with our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE. Fifty-nine years ago another decorated military general was relieved of his command after clashing with the president.  General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of the United Nations forces in the Korean War believed the only path to victory there would be an all-out offensive against China, a view not shared by President Harry Truman.  Still, MacArthur issued an unauthorized public statement threatening China and was fired for insubordination.  But upon his return to the U.S.,
MacArthur was greeted as a national hero and congressional leaders received two million pieces of mail in support of him. A few days later, Republican Senator Everett Dirksen appeared right here on MEET THE PRESS and offered his take on the situation."
202,"(Videotape, April 22, 1951)"
203,"MRS. MAY CRAIG:  Senator, nobody's talking about anything but General MacArthur.  Would you tell us very briefly how you stand on the dismissal of General MacArthur so we can follow that up? "
204,"SEN. EVERETT DIRKSEN (R-Il):  Well, May, I can express it in just a sentence or two.  First of all, I thought he made a deep and emphatic impression with a great and restrained speech.  Secondly, I do not deny the right of the commander in chief to dismiss a subordinate, but I
thought it was probably the most inept piece of work that was ever done in history.  And the demonstrations, of course, that we've had simply means that this man, who was the embodiment of the hopes of humble people, is certainly being taken into the bosom of America to show how they feel about him, and I feel the same way."
205,(End videotape)
206,"MR. GREGORY:  Less than two weeks later, the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees began joint closed-door hearings on the dismissal of General MacArthur.  He testified for three straight days, insisting he could have won the Korean conflict if he had been allowed to stick to his plan."
207,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  A quick programming note here, Richard Engel will report on a father's quest to investigate a 2008 Taliban ambush that left nine U.S. soldiers dead, including his son, ""A Father's Mission."" That's tonight, Sunday, on ""Dateline"" at 7, 6 Central."
208,"That is all for today.  We'll be away next Sunday during NBC's coverage of the Wimbledon championship, but we will return the following week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, healthcare reform's final act.
    "
1,(Videotape)
2,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  I do not know how this plays politically, but I know it's right."
3,(End videotape)
4,MR. GREGORY:  The president makes one last push...
5,(Videotape)
6,PRES. OBAMA:  The United States Congress owes the American people an up or down vote on health insurance reform.
7,(End videotape)
8,"MR. GREGORY:  ...but will members of his own party provide the necessary votes?  This morning we discuss the politics, the policy, and the endgame with Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. Then, the political stakes in 2010 and beyond for the Obama presidency--health care, an ethics scandal hurting two prominent Democrats, plus the great recession's crippling toll, the jobless rate is unchanged for February and housing has yet to rebound.  Can Washington find a way to work together to do some good?  Joining us:  Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah; former congressman from Tennessee, Democrat Harold Ford; E.J. Dionne, columnist for The Washington Post; and Rich Lowry, editor of the National Review. "
9,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  But first, the final push for healthcare reform.  And joining us live here this morning, the secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius."
10,Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
11,SEC'Y KATHLEEN SEBELIUS:  Thank you.  Nice to be here.
12,"MR. GREGORY:  Endgame time, the president talked about it in his remarks this week.  This is what he said."
13,"(Videotape, Wednesday)"
14,"PRES. OBAMA:  Every idea has been put on the table.  Every argument has been made.  Everything there is to say about health care has been said, and just about everybody has said it."
15,(End videotape)
16,"MR. GREGORY:  He said it with a smile, but he's making a serious point. This is really the end of the line for the debate.  And here are two facts:  Most people who have health insurance like what they have, and a majority of Americans oppose this president's version of healthcare
reform.  So how, realistically, do you get this done?"
17,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, I think, David, what we're hearing from people across America is that even people who have insurance are terrified about what's going on in the marketplace.  They're opening their statements, they're seeing these incredible rate increases, if they're not protected by a large employer, going on across the country.  We just got a Goldman Sachs analyst who said that the market competition is decreasing in this country, that in the individual market, in the small group market where small employers are absolutely caught, they have no choice; and they are getting increasingly frustrated.  So I think we know what doing nothing looks like, and it looks pretty scary.  Fifteen thousand people a day lose their insurance, and some of those folks are being actually priced out of the marketplace."
18,"MR. GREGORY:  But, and that's usually the basis for the president saying the American people don't want us to wait.  But where is the evidence of that? Certainly, we can all talk to people who don't like their situation, who are worried or are going through very difficult times.
But, again, a fact is that a majority of Americans, after everybody has said everything, as the president said, don't support this administration's version of reform."
19,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, I think if you say, ""Do you want,"" you know, ""some massive bill,"" that people are a little unclear about what's in it given the amount of misinformation.  They say, you know, ""We don't know. We're, we're unsure."" You say, ""Do you want rules to change for insurance companies?  Do you want them to have to compete in the marketplace?  Do you want some oversight?  Do you want some consumer protection?"" They say absolutely yes. ""Do you want a different marketplace where people can have some choice and competition just like the members of Congress have?"" Absolutely yes."
20,"You know, I had a meeting last week with five of the largest insurance company CEOs, and we talked to them about what in the world is going on, how in the world does somebody like Ms. Canfield, who the president cited, who's paying $6,000 in premiums, she's paid $4,000 out of pocket, her premiums went up 25 percent last year.  The company, on her behalf--she's put $10,000 of her own money on the table.  The company paid out about $900 in bills, and she just got a rate increase of 40 percent.  How in the world does that work?  How does that math work? And, frankly, we didn't get very good answers from the insurance companies."
21,"MR. GREGORY:  And you're pushing for more answers, for more transparency."
22,SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  You bet.  You bet.
23,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, what do you hope to achieve out of that?"
24,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, I think at the very least, the American public has to understand what is going on.  What are the justifications for rate increases which are so far ahead of medical trends?  How much are the companies collecting in overhead profits?  How much are they paying their CEOs?  And how much are they actually paying in medical trends?  The insurance execs said to me, you know, ""It's all about costs, and we're just sort of passing along costs."" But that's not what their profit statements say.  When profits go up 50 percent from '09 to--I mean, '08 to '09, when they file $12.7 billion worth of profits and then turn around and say, ""We need 40 percent rate increases,"" 60 percent in Illinois, we need at least to shine a bright light until we pass health reform and change the rules."
25,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me bring you back to the here and now. I've spoken recently to a top ally of the president on healthcare reform who thinks there's about a 40 percent chance, ultimately, of getting this done. Where do you put the odds?"
26,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  I think we'll have the votes to pass comprehensive health reform.  A bill has passed the House with a majority, a bipartisan majority. A bill has passed the Senate with a supermajority.  That's never been done before.  What we're talking about, as the president said, is finishing the job.  And the urgency, the timetable is not about some congressional time clock, it's about what's happening across this country to Americans."
27,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but..."
28,SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  It's about the squeeze.
29,"MR. GREGORY:  ...but this, this is Washington; it is about a time clock for Congress.  You have set deadlines before and they have slipped.  Is a new deadline, the Easter recess, if it's not done by that point, will the president return to it?"
30,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  I think that we have to act on behalf of the American people. I hear from folks all over this country.  I talked to a dad in Chicago whose son, 11-year-old, healthy, bright, came--coming back from a soccer tournament, but born with a heart defect.  He had an operation at a month old, an operation when he was three.  This father, who is self-employed, runs a small consulting company, is paying $30,000 a year in health insurance premiums and doesn't know what happens next, needs some control over his own health security, over his family's security."
31,"MR. GREGORY:  Understood, point taken.  My question is, does this have to be accomplished by March 18th, by the, by the Easter recess if it's going to get done?"
32,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  I think the president has called for an up or down vote. I'm confident that we'll have that up or down vote, and I'm..."
33,"MR. GREGORY:  You won't set a deadline, though?"
34,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  I, I have not set a deadline.  That's really up to the leadership of Congress."
35,"MR. GREGORY:  But if it's not passed by the April break, is it realistic that it ever comes back?"
36,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, I think it's realistic because the American people are desperate for something to happen."
37,MR. GREGORY:  So the president would come back to it if it doesn't get done by the break?
38,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  David, I think what's going on around the country argues for a..."
39,"MR. GREGORY:  But I'm just trying to pin you down.  I think this is an important point about when it gets done,"
40,SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well...
41,MR. GREGORY:  ...because the legislative calendar does influence policy.
42,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well--right.  But the time clock is not about, again, a congressional ticktock.  What Americans want is something to be done, that's what I hear.  You know, as a former governor, governors work on a very specific timetable, they have to pass budgets, the legislature goes out of, out of session.  We've got to get things moving because there's an urgency about what's happening in people's lives.  And we're at the final chapter here."
43,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
44,SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  We need an up or down vote.
45,"MR. GREGORY:  Final stab--yes, no or maybe?  Do you get passage by the Easter break?"
46,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  I think we'll have the votes when the leadership decides it's time to call for the vote, and I think health reform will pass."
47,"MR. GREGORY:  The issue of what's at stake here, it's very interesting, the president talked about that.  The New York Post reported this on Friday--I'll put it up on the screen.  ""President Obama pushed wavering House members to OK health-care legislation for his own political
standing and for theirs.  ... `To maintain a strong presidency, we need to pass the bill,' Obama told liberals, according to"" one Arizona representative who attended the meeting. This is very interesting, ""to maintain a strong presidency."" Elaborate on that."
48,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, again, I think the president has laid out comprehensive health reform as a primary agenda item not because he doesn't have good health choices or because it's easy politically, but because he feels it's fundamental to fixing the economy and it's fundamental in terms of jobs, small..."
49,"MR. GREGORY:  It's fundamental to having ""a strong presidency"" is what he's reported to have said."
50,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, I wasn't in that room.  What I can tell you what--is what he's said..."
51,MR. GREGORY:  But you work with him closely.  Are the stakes that high? Is his agenda in peril if he doesn't get this?  Is that what's at stake?
52,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, I think what's in peril is health security for millions of Americans.  What's in peril is the fact that small business owners currently are having to choose between hiring another worker or two or having health insurance.  They're losing employees to folks down the street who have bargaining power.  We have folks absolutely caught in jobs that they hate. They are terrified about leaving their position.  We are--actually have a handicap in the economy because we haven't fixed this massive health insurance system, and we've got to tackle that.  And I think that's what the president understands."
53,MR. GREGORY:  Deadlines have come and gone.  This has gone on longer than the president wanted or expected.  Ground has been lost.  What mistakes did the administration make in laying out the strategy to get healthcare reform?
54,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, I think the president, from the outset, was very hopeful that we would have a broad bipartisan coalition.  It's why I think months were spent in the United States Senate with six senators in a room--three Republicans and three Democrats.  Lots of good Republican ideas are in the bill--help for small business, tax credits, selling insurance across state lines, aggressively going after fraud and abuse. Unfortunately, those good ideas still haven't produced Republican votes. But the president wants to take the best ideas from Republicans and Democrats.  He will continue to do that, and he hopes, at the end of the day, we'll have some Republican votes along the way."
55,MR. GREGORY:  But what missteps did the administration make?
56,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, I think that there's no question that having, you know, an issue like this on the table is complicated, it's difficult. And sometimes, I think people got lost in the, in the weeds, if you will. There's a lot of technical issues here.  When people understand what's
in a bill--a new insurance marketplace giving small business owners and individuals the same choices that members of Congress have, new rules for insurance companies--and, David, this is a fundamental difference between Republicans and Democrats, they really don't believe that insurance companies should have more consumer protections, more oversights, that it
should change the rules. And I think, at the end of the day, that may be the dividing line where Republicans will not vote for a bill that cracks down on insurance company abuses, changes the practices that people are..."
57,MR. GREGORY:  You have--you had unified opposition from Republicans.  Did you also have a breakdown in the president's and the administration's communication to the American people about what the goal was and how you get there?
58,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, I think that there--when you have anything that's this comprehensive, there are always strategies along the way that focus on things. And we spent way too much time and energy talking about what's not in the bill, trying to tamp down some of the, you know, wild rumors, wild accusations.  And I think now we've circled back to saying to people
the bill is pretty simple at the end of the day, more focus on wellness and prevention, better choices for folks.  The same choices that members of Congress have in their own health plan should be given to the people who pay those bills, should be given to the American taxpayers, and change the rules for insurance companies, lower the deficit, not only short-term $100 billion, but long-term over $1 trillion.  This is something that changes those cost estimates, at the end of the day, that really are handicapping the country's economy from moving ahead."
59,"MR. GREGORY:  In any rollout of a big sweeping policy proposal like this, you set goals you set priorities.  When you were last on the program in the summer, the first thing we talked about was the president's number one priority, and he laid it out last June."
60,"(Videotape, June 23, 2009)"
61,"PRES. OBAMA:  What I've said is, our top priority has to be to control costs. controlling costs, that's not a bill I can support.  It's going to have to control costs."
62,(End videotape)
63,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet Democrats I've talked to, Republicans for sure, outside experts have said, frankly, this bill fails to adequately control costs. Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, somebody that the president said he would listen to, spoke about the fact that it fails to really
tackle costs adequately in the healthcare system.  He spoke on CNBC this week, listen to this."
64,"(Videotape, Monday)"
65,"MR. WARREN BUFFETT:  And I would say that one way or another, we're going to attack costs, costs, costs.  Just like they talk about jobs, jobs, jobs in the economy.  It's costs, costs, costs on this side. That's a tough job.  ...  I would try to get a unified effort, say, ""This is a national emergency to do something about this.  We need the Republicans, we need the Democrats.  We're going to cut off all the kinds of things like the 800,000 special people in Florida, or the `Cornhusker kickback,' as they called it, or `the Louisiana Purchase.' We're going, we're going to get rid of the nonsense. We're just going to focus on costs, and we're not going to dream up 2,000 pages of other things."""
66,(End videotape)
67,"MR. GREGORY:  Why not focus at this point with the outcome uncertain and say, you know, ""We're just going to do a bill that focuses on reducing costs, and then we'll come back to the idea of expanding access at a, at a point later on when it's more politically feasible""?"
68,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well I think we definitely learned a lesson from what happened in Massachusetts from the bill that former Governor Romney signed into law, where they pushed access, but didn't deal with costs at the same time.  And so it's why the president has been insistent from the outset that this deal with costs.  Every cost-cutting idea that every health economist has brought to the table is in this bill.  Massive changes in the delivery system, ways to discourage the kind of Cadillac insurance plans being offered into the future, a fairness in terms of who's paying for healthcare costs, less spending in the Medicare system for things that we know don't add to people's health outcomes but were oversubsidizing insurance companies, really aggressively going after fraud and abuse, which is why the president directed the attorney general and me to, you know, put together strike task forces. Additional ideas
are in there.  Every idea is on the table."
69,"MR. GREGORY:  But you, but you don't, you don't deal with tort reform, which the president has talked about more recently."
70,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Actually, we do deal with tort reform.  That's just not true. He moved ahead on tort reform early on, directing me to..."
71,MR. GREGORY:  Pilot programs is what you supported.
72,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  ...put money out.  Well, but states are in various stages."
73,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
74,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  And many states, like my own state of Kansas, have already passed full tort reform; others haven't at all.  This is really a state-level situation..."
75,MR. GREGORY:  But whether it comes to...
76,SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  ...where we want to see the best ideas that work.
77,"MR. GREGORY:  ...malpractice reform, whether is comes to..."
78,SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Which is in the bill.
79,"MR. GREGORY:  ...subsidizing volume, whether it comes to, you know, salaries for doctors and so forth, do you really assertdo you disagree with Warren Buffett that this adequately bends the cost curve?"
80,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, according to the nonpartisan accounting Congressional Budget Office, they say we get a--over $100 billion in deficit saving the first 10 years, and that ramps up as you look in the outer years to $1 trillion.  I think that's real cost-cutting.  I think that's real change in the deficit over time."
81,"MR. GREGORY:  But where are the cultural changes to how expensive end-of-life care is, or how many tests are ordered by doctors, or the administrative costs, be them in hospitals or insurance companies?"
82,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  That's, that's all in there.  It's all in there. There's a huge amount of administrative simplification.  Getting to that 30 cents of every dollar that's not paid, paying benefits but currently has docs filling out a gazillion forms, and has insurance companies
providing billing over and over again.  We've got huge delivery system changes so that you no longer would pay hospitals if--one out of every five patients gets re-admitted in 30 days.  You pay for bundled care, which is a coordination between docs and hospitals.  Pay for medical
homes, follow-up care.  We know that not only are those good for patients, but they're hugely cost effective.  They're in the best healthcare systems in America, and that's the direction this bill goes. And it pays for health and wellness for the first time, preventive care."
83,"MR. GREGORY:  But it--but even--but, Secretary Sebelius, even experts, people who run the Cleveland Clinic, or the Mayo Clinic, who have really been on the vanguard of reducing costs..."
84,SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Yes.
85,"MR. GREGORY:  ...they say there's only the potential for some of these things to pay off in terms of you getting away from subsidizing volume. So how can you assert with such certainty that this bill measures up to the president's goal of bending that cost curve, of bringing healthcare costs down?"
86,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, one of the things that we do, again, is change the insurance rules on the private sector.  That will lower costs for families, lower costs for businesses.  Everybody says that just having a new insurance marketplace, getting rid of the cherry-picking, allowing
insurance companies to go back and forth, not only streamlines administrative costs, but lowers costs overall.  And we run two of the major public health systems, changing the way Medicare pays for medical care, that we pay for quality and not any longer by the number of tests that you do, will help also drive the private market.  We've got every strategy, every idea that health economists that experts say works is in this bill, including a lot of measures, David, which the Congressional Budget Office doesn't count for.  They say maybe health IT, you know, the use of electronic health records pays off.  We know it does. It's in the system, they don't give credit for that.  We know that investing in health and wellness works.  If you have fewer diabetics in 10 years, if you have fewer people who smoke, if you have fewer overweight and obese Americans, that's going to lower health costs.  No credit is given to that.  So we get, right now, $1 trillion over two decades in health savings without even giving credit to a number of the programs that work."
87,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to, I want to go to just a couple of more issues. One has to do with how this gets paid for, and that is tax, an excise tax on these so-called ""gold-plated"" or ""Cadillac"" plans.  But in the Senate bill, that's been put off until 2018.  And the reasonable question comes up, which is, do you really think a future Congress, which will be under
a lot of pressure not to raise $1 trillion worth of taxes, is going to withstand that pressure?  Or are you going to be left where, you know, because this Congress won't raise the tax now, they're going to put it off till 2018, so you're going to have all this spending and not get any
of the savings until 2018?  Isn't that unrealistic?"
88,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, I think two things happen right away with the way this is designed.  First of all, it puts insurance companies, who pay the tax ultimately, on notice that this is coming, and they can begin to change the kind of policies that are in the marketplace.  What we want to do is change insurance company behavior which hasn't been very strategic
in terms of cutting costs.  And, in fact, as the Goldman analyst said, ""They are driving up costs.  They have a market strategy that they're willing to dump customers and continue to raise costs."" So changing their behavior, putting them on notice that this is coming.  If a future
Congress decided that this wasn't a good idea, the way the rules work, they have to come up with billions of dollars in, in substitute payment. This is subject to the PAYGO bill.  They don't just get to cancel it and, and march down the road.  So I think it, it is a good balance between
getting a very effective cost strategy as part of this legislation and putting people on notice so that their policies don't change overnight. This isn't imposed overnight, but they know it's coming, and we've got to change the structure."
89,"MR. GREGORY:  The issue of abortion is one that has 12 Democrats who voted yes for the bill in the House previously saying that they're going to vote no now.  Leading that charge is Bart Stupak.  He's from Michigan, an anti-abortion congressman who doesn't want any federal money paying for abortion.  And this is what he said about the current status of the bill."
90,"(Videotape, Wednesday)"
91,"REP. BART STUPAK (D-MI):  ...in the Senate bill--and that's where they're telling us the vehicle we're using--in the Senate bill, it says you must offer insurance policies that will be paid for by the federal government that covers abortion.  You must do so.  Also in that same language, if
you come in the Senate version, in the OPM, Office of Personnel Management, policies they'll be putting forth, you must pay--every enrollee must pay $1 per month into a fund to help fund abortions.  It's very clear."
92,(End videotape)
93,MR. GREGORY:  Will you make the fix that he's talking about so that there's no federal money paying for abortions? 
94,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, there is no federal money paying for abortions, and that's just not my statement, it is what, you know, a legal analyst who has looked at the Senate bill, it's what the fact checkers who, who look at the statements say.  I don't think there's any disagreement, and Bart Stupak and--Congressman Stupak and the president want health reform. He has been a strong member of Energy and Commerce.  He's worked on health reform issues over the years, and, and he supports the president's notion about this. Congressman Stupak and the president agree that there should be no federal funding for abortion.  And I think, at the end of the day, they..."
95,"MR. GREGORY:  But they don't--yeah, but they don't agree about how you're getting this.  So what, what needs to be done to take him--he used to be a yes vote, he's now a no vote.  How does he become a yes vote again? "
96,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, I think people will continue to talk to him.  I think that, that there is no question in my mind..."
97,MR. GREGORY:  Just to try to persuade him that he's wrong?
98,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, I think, I think there's no question that the Senate bill does not provide any federal funding for abortion.  But in--at the end of the day, I think that we'll get to the point that there's agreement that there's no federal funding on abortion."
99,MR. GREGORY:  So he's just misinformed?
100,"SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Well, I think he's misinformed about what the Senate language actually does.  But he wants comprehensive health reform.  I know that he has this principled issue.  The president said from the outset this is about health reform, it is not about abortion.  We don't want to change the status quo.  There are very clear rules that apply across the board on federal funding for abortion coverage, and that's what we'll have at the end of the day."
101,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we will leave it there.  Secretary Sebelius, thank you very much as always."
102,SEC'Y SEBELIUS:  Thank you.
103,"MR. GREGORY:  Up next, the political stakes of this healthcare debate, plus ethics scandals plague some prominent Democrats, and the economy's still struggling.  How will it all impact the midterm elections and the future of the Obama presidency?  Our roundtable weighs in.  Senator Orrin Hatch, former Congressman Harold Ford Jr., E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post, and Rich Lowry of National Review, only on MEET THE PRESS."
104,(Announcements)
105,"MR. GREGORY:  Our roundtable weighs in on the politics of healthcare reform, the 2010 midterms, and the Obama presidency right after this brief station break."
106,(Announcements)
107,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We are back, joined now by The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, former Democratic Congressman Harold Ford Jr., and Rich Lowry of the National Review. "
108,Welcome to all of you.
109,"OK, Senator Hatch, you just heard Secretary Sebelius.  So what's going to happen here?  Don't just be partisan, be analytical.  Is this victory, defeat on health care or something in between?"
110,"SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R-UT):  Well, it may be, it may be any one of those three, and it depends on whether they continue to abuse the rules.  You know, the filibuster rule has, has been around since, really, the turn of the last century.  And one person could stop, could stop the whole Senate since 1806, and there were a lot of Founding Fathers who voted for that.
On the other hand, the, the reconciliation rule, which they are going to use--in fact, I..."
111,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
112,"SEN. HATCH:  ...just had this quote from Senator Durbin.  He said, ""We will be testing some reconciliation rules and provisions that have never been tested before."" And I think that's exactly what they're going to do..."
113,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  You, you..."
114,SEN. HATCH:  ...and it depends on whether they can pull it off.
115,MR. GREGORY:  We're going to get to...
116,SEN. HATCH:  Sure.
117,MR. GREGORY:  ...reconciliation and that debate in just a moment.
118,SEN. HATCH:  Sure.
119,"MR. GREGORY:  But E.J., where are we?  Same question.  Is this victory, defeat, or is there something in between that the president achieves?"
120,"MR. E.J. DIONNE:  I don't think there's anything in between, and I do want to get back to this reconciliation argument."
121,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah, we will.  We will.  Promise."
122,"MR. DIONNE:  But I think the bill is going to pass.  I think that the bill will pass partly for political reasons.  The Democrats have to prove
they can govern."
123,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
124,"MR. DIONNE:  And if they--this is the centerpiece of their agenda. They've been fighting for this for generations.  If they can't get it now, I think they will get absolutely clobbered in the election.  But they're also going to get it passed because what underlies this are two
things:  One, this bill provides coverage for 30 million people, and that's really important; but the second reason is lots of people with health insurance now are going to lose it if we don't do anything.  There was a report out of Wall Street last week that showed that insurance
companies are jacking up their rates because, in a lot of markets, there's no competition.  And they're willing to lose some people, drop people from coverage because they can make more profit with higher rates. If we don't lose--if we don't do something about this system, a lot of
employers won't be able to afford covering their employees anymore."
125,"MR. GREGORY:  Harold Ford, you've been in Congress.  This is also a question of process, not just reconciliation, which again, we'll, we'll get to is that budget measure.  How do the no votes become yes votes in the House?  There were 39 no votes among House Democrats and there could be 11 more that become no over this abortion language, which you heard Secretary Sebelius suggest--address.  How do they get the votes?"
126,"FMR. REP. HAROLD FORD JR.  (D-TN):  Two ways.  First, you were--Democrats in the Senate were able to convince some Senate Republicans--Scott Brown, Voinovich, Kit Bond and few others--to vote in favor of a jobs bill that Senator Hatch and Senator Schumer played a key role in putting together. You've got to find those areas and those instances where you can bring people over.  I think E.J.'s points are well-taken.  The only challenges--I think if there are votes for reconciliation--I know we're going to come to this in a few minutes..."
127,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
128,"REP. FORD:  ...but if there were votes for reconciliation, it probably would have already been done.  So the question is whether or not, if there are not enough votes to pass by reconciliation, do you reach out to those Democrats or do you begin to reach out to some Republicans?  When LBJ and the Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen worked to pass civil
rights legislation, they worked together.  It may be that the president and the team now can find ways to bring a few Republicans over.  And if you have to vote with the reconciliation vote, wouldn't it be amazing if you lost a few Democrats but picked up a few Republicans?  It might make it easier..."
129,MR. RICH LOWRY:  It would be amazing.  It would literally be amazing.
130,MR. GREGORY:  It would really...
131,REP. FORD:  It would make it...
132,SEN. HATCH:  How about a miracle?
133,"REP. FORD:  But, but, but I don't, I don't, I don't put amazing, I don't put amazing out of reach.  Warren Buffett was on one of our sister networks, one of NBC's sister networks this week, and said, look, if plan A, meaning the status quo..."
134,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
135,"REP. FORD:  ...is what we would have to accept, he's not for that; if plan B is the only option, he would take it, which is the Senate bill. But really, a plan C is needed.  It might be that a plan C, which is a reconciliation approach, could be adopted if we found ways to win some
Republicans over, hold on to the core of Democrats, and pass a meaningful health reform here."
136,"MR. GREGORY:  The problem for Democrats here, Rich, is what I said to Secretary Sebelius.  The president said it, ""Everything's been said."" We know everything we need to know about this."
137,MR. LOWRY:  Yeah.
138,MR. GREGORY:  The public opposes the reform writ large.
139,MR. LOWRY:  That's right.
140,"MR. GREGORY:  And that is what they're dealing with, they have a massive reform bill.  They can't pick it apart just yet.  What happens?"
141,"MR. LOWRY:  So they, so they have to try to force it through just on sheer partisan muscle.  They're going to come down with the full force of the party and, and the president on every single one of these members. And Nancy Pelosi's going to channel Ataturk and his famous order of the battle of Gallipoli:  ""I don't order you to attack, I order you to die."" And Democrats, they seem to think that if they pass this they're going to put it behind him. They'll really put it right back in front of them again.  This will be a debate for years because this bill has serious
legitimacy problems.  It--the partisan nature of the votes, the rotten deals that have been part of the process, now reconciliation on part of that--on top of that, and then the sheer unpopularity of it.  And Tom Daschle said long ago, ""Do this in a bipartisan way."" And I think he
cited the example of Australia, where they had very narrow votes for healthcare reform, and then it was repealed and they went back and forth and back and forth again until they got some sort of consensus."
142,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  So let's get to this whole business of reconciliation, which budget reconciliation means you, you have a separate bill here that would only need a simple majority, that would just deal with some of the spending provisions of health care."
143,"You two, Senator Hatch and E.J. Dionne, had some words about this on the pages of The Washington Post, and let me--Senator Hatch, let me put a portion of what you wrote about reconciliation on the screen:  ""This use of reconciliation to jam through this legislation, against the will of the American people, would be unprecedented in scope.  And the havoc wrought would threaten our system of checks and balances, corrode the legislative process, degrade our system of government and damage the prospects of bipartisanship."""
144,"E.J., your response on the pages of the Post included this:  ""I'm disappointed in Hatch, co-sponsor of two of my favorite bills in recent years.  One created the State Children's Health Insurance Program.  The other, signed last year by Obama, broadly expanded service opportunities. Hatch worked on both with his dear friend, the late Edward M.  Kennedy, after whom the service bill was named."
145,"""It was Kennedy, you'll recall, who insisted that health care was a `fundamental right and not a privilege.' That's why it's not just legitimate to use reconciliation to complete the work on health reform. It would be immoral to do otherwise and thereby let a phony argument about process get in the way of health coverage for 30 million Americans."" Discuss."
146,"SEN. HATCH:  Well, Democrats--this is not a fight between Republicans and Democrats in a real sense, it's between Democrats and the people out there. Fifty-eight percent of the people are against this bill and very few are for it.  The fact of the matter is they're going to abuse the reconciliation rules.  And let me tell you, the reconciliation rules have never been used for such sweeping social legislation like this.  This is one-sixth of the American economy.  It's sweeping in, in effect. There--and, and, and there have been three sweeping social bull--not
sweeping, but social bills that have been approved through reconciliation.  One was, of course, the, the welfare reform. That had 78 positive votes, but--huge bipartisan vote.  Another one was the SCHIP bill, my bill with Senator Kennedy.  That had 85 votes.  The third one was college tuition, and that had, I think, something like 78 votes.  The fact of the matter is, is that it has never been done before, it's never been used before.  To do this is just very, very dangerous.  It's going to cause an awful lot of problems.  And in the end, in the end, you're
going to--and let's, let's look at one other thing.  The Senate bill was passed.  Now, E.J. seems to accept the fact that the House bill was passed, but they're two different bills.  Now they're going to take the Senate bill, they say.  But if they had the votes, it would already have
been voted on.  They don't have the votes.  So I suspect they're going to manipulate the rules even further in ways that were never contemplated in order to get this dog through..."
147,MR. GREGORY:  E.J....
148,"SEN. HATCH:  ...this 2,700-page  2,711-page dog."
149,"MR. DIONNE:  Where to begin?  First of all, I find it astonishing that so many Republicans who, when President Bush surged troops into Iraq against the polls, said, ""This is a courageous act."" And when President Obama tries to push a healthcare bill against the polls, ""This is a terrible
thing."" This is not a consistent argument.  Several points.  First, the health bill that with--President Obama will sign got 60 votes in the Senate, because that's the bill the House would pass.  The only thing that's being talked about here are amendments that would be passed
through reconciliation dealing with money, which is in the tradition of reconciliation."
150,"Second, Senator Hatch keeps saying this is unprecedented in scope and
that, you know..."
151,SEN. HATCH:  It is.
152,"MR. DIONNE:  ...you need bipartisan support.  There's a big chart in New York Times today put together by Tom Mann of Brookings, Norm Ornstein, and their colleagues.  In the--there are seven instances where reconciliation was used in cases where the bill got less--fewer than 60
votes, five of those were done by Republican Senates.  And I didn't hear Senator Hatch complain about that. Two of those involved President Bush's tax cuts, which added $1.7 trillion to our deficit."
153,SEN. HATCH:  It never...
154,"MR. DIONNE:  Now, if that isn't significant policy change, I don't know
what is."
155,SEN. HATCH:  And if ever...
156,"MR. DIONNE:  And there was no complaint about that.  So is Senator Hatch saying it's OK to use reconciliation to pass tax cuts for the wealthy, but it's just terrible to use it if you're going to extend healthcare coverage?  I say let's not talk about a phony process argument, let's
talk about the problems people have with health care.  If he wants to argue about health care..."
157,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Quick response, Senator, and then let me get the others in on this."
158,"SEN. HATCH:  In every case except two they were--they, they had bipartisan votes.  In two of them--in 1993, Clinton's bill, yeah, they got a reconciliation bill on a purely partisan vote that Congress changed to Republicans.  The Republicans did the same thing in I think it was
2005, got a bill through just on a totally partisan vote, and it changed to Democrats. The fact of the matter is you can't..."
159,MR. DIONNE:  Are you talking about bipartisanship or you talking about reconciliation?
160,"SEN. HATCH:  You can't--no, wait, wait, wait.  You can't..."
161,MR. DIONNE:  These were reconciliation bills...
162,SEN. HATCH:  That was reconciliation.
163,MR. DIONNE:  ...that picked up one or two Democrats.
164,"SEN. HATCH:  You cannot ignore the fact that we're talking about the first time in history, sweeping social legislation will be passed, if they get their way, by a totally partisan vote.  One-sixth of the American economy.  If we do that, Katy bar the door, I got to tell you."
165,"MR. DIONNE:  If the Republican Party were not sitting there being obstructionist--what Senator Hatch is saying is, if Republicans unite and say, ""We won't vote for this,"" and you need bipartisanship, he's saying Democrats can't govern.  And if $1.7 trillion..."
166,"SEN. HATCH:  Well, they can't."
167,"MR. DIONNE:  ...in tax cuts isn't significant, I don't know what is."
168,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, let, let me..."
169,SEN. HATCH:  One very...
170,"MR. GREGORY:  Hold on, hold on."
171,"Rich Lowry, the question here is whether this, this amounts to petty politics on either side, depending upon your point of view, or whether this is a leadership issue."
172,"MR. LOWRY:  Process arguments like this are always festivals of partisan hypocrisy.  No one is so concerned as--with protecting the rights of minority unless they're in the minority themselves.  And some of the same liberal pundits who are saying reconciliation was--is a great process were defending the filibuster up and down during the Bush years.  So I, I
think the most important thing to know here, they no longer have 60 votes in the Senate, so they have to do an end run around this process.  And if reconciliation isn't so important to this, fine, let's do a conference committee, let's work out the differences and have the House pass it and the Senate pass it.  They no longer can do this--do that because the bill was rejected by the public, as demonstrated in Massachusetts, which took away the 60 votes majority.  So they need the end, end run."
173,"MR. GREGORY:  Harold, final, final point on this piece of it, which is doesn't the president have a bigger problem if he doesn't get the reform he's after than on taking a hit politically for the process?"
174,"REP. FORD:  You're right, results are more important than process.  The only ideology a majority of Americans are concerned about right now is the result. Two, reconciliation is a rule that can be used and invoked in the Senate.  If Democrats have the votes, they should move forward with it.  What Senator Hatch is saying is very simple, that if you do that you run the risk of political backlash.  When Democrats did it in '93--it actually was the right thing when Clinton passed that '93 budget, because it helped us grow. Republicans did it in 2005, and there are other examples.  There might be a political switch.  But what I hear E.J. saying is that that's a risk that they're going to have to take."
175,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
176,"REP. FORD:  At the end of the day, the country could care less about all of this.  They want an answer.  And at the end of the day, jobs will decide this midterm election more than anything."
177,"MR. GREGORY:  I--E.J., I'm going to take a break, and we're going to come back and talk about some of the political fallout.  But I want to ask a substantive point that I brought up with Secretary Sebelius.  Number one goal in healthcare reform was to bend the cost curve to bring down costs. The likes of Warren Buffett and others have said, ""It's just not doing it.  They should have really done a cost issue first, expand access later."" What's truth, what's fiction on this?"
178,"MR. DIONNE:  Look, there are a lot of measures in this bill to hold down costs.  Some of them are painful, which is why it's hard to assemble votes for this.  There will never be enough cost controls for everybody, and the more you put in the more votes you lose.  I think--the CBO says that--Congressional Budget Office, says that over time this bill will reduce the deficit.  That's the evidence we have, and you can postpone insuring--you know, providing insurance for the uninsured forever if you just say, ""Well, we got to fix everything else and then we'll get all these people insurance."" On Rich's point about process, I went back and looked at all the columns I wrote criticizing the Bush tax cuts.  I never made a process argument about reconciliation.  I argued about the merits of the tax cut, and I think instead of talking about process we ought to talk about the merits of the health plan."
179,"MR. LOWRY:  But you really, you did, E.J., you did write a very stirring column about the nuclear option in defense of the Senate..."
180,MR. DIONNE:  That was...(unintelligible).
181,"MR. LOWRY:  ...as an anti, as an anti-majoritarian institution."
182,MR. DIONNE:  That has nothing to do with--I believe...
183,"MR. LOWRY:  And look, just one last thing..."
184,SEN. HATCH:  I've got it right here.
185,"MR. LOWRY:  ...E.J., the point you're saying if Republicans are united, the Democrats can't govern, is what they're saying.  It would have been relatively easy--and Senator Hatch would be an expert on this because he worked so closely with Ted Kennedy on health issues--to get 65 or 70 votes for a major healthcare bill in the Senate.  Not this, but $100 [billion], $200 billion more for Medicaid, for SCHIP, maybe some version of this Plan B we've seen reporting about that the White House--after Massachusetts came up with a plan where they'd cover just 15 million people at a quarter of the cost.  You do something like that and you would have picked off five or 10 Republicans in the Senate, but they didn't want to do it."
186,MR. DIONNE:  Senator Baucus spent months holding hand--Senator Baucus spent months holding hands with Senator Bauc--with Senator Grassley and Senator Enzi and got nowhere.
187,"SEN. HATCH:  I, I, I..."
188,"MR. GREGORY:  OK, quick final point then I'm going to take a break. Senator:"
189,"SEN. HATCH:  I was a member of the gang of seven.  He was so restricted by the Democrat process that he couldn't really do anything for Republicans. So I had to leave just out of honor because I couldn't--I'd walk out of there and, and trash everything they were doing, so I left
out of honor.  The other Republicans gradually left, too.  There has been no real effort to try and get together on all the things we can get together on.  It's just been ""take it or leave it,"" and that's been their attitude."
190,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we're going to, we're going to leave, we're going to leave it there.  We're going to come back, talk more about the politics with our roundtable for 2010 after this brief station break. Don't go away."
191,(Announcements)
192,MR. GREGORY:  We are back to continue our roundtable discussion with a lively bunch this morning.
193,"Harold Ford, a lot of headlines politically out of New York this week, and one had to do with you in that you decided not to take on Senator Gillibrand and challenge her, her Senate seat this fall.  And you wrote an op-ed on Tuesday explaining, and part of it I'll put up on the screen. ""The cruel twist, of course, is that the party bosses who tried to intimidate me so that I wouldn't even think about funning against Senator Gillibrand ...  are the same people responsible for putting Democratic control of the Senate at risk."" Talk about a shot across the bow.  What are you talking about?"
194,"REP. FORD:  My party needs to understand that there is growing, if not a crescendo of concern about jobs, taxes and the economy.  There's great concern even with 36,000 jobs being lost, which is far less last month than months before.  But there's a concern if the platform, the growth platform going forward that will create new jobs and provide economic security for families is not there.  I, I want everyone to have health care, but I can assure you as someone who has spent two months traveling a state that is vital to the nation's economy, I would argue the global economy in New York City and, of course, New York State, voters are more
concerned about their own checkbooks, their pocketbooks, and their wallets.  I hope whatever happens on health care that we get it done. And if the focus can shift to how America grows going forward, how we maintain our leadership position globally, and, more important, how you
give the next generation of Americans a chance to compete and win in a global economy.  That's being voiced and articulated"
195,MR. GREGORY:  But...
196,REP. FORD:  ...all across the state and...
197,MR. GREGORY:  ...who are the party bosses who are endangering the majority in the Senate?
198,"REP. FORD:  I think there's been a unilateral focus on one or two issues that, again, don't necessarily rank at the top of where a majority of New Yorkers, I'd say an overwhelming majority of New Yorkers what they're concerned about.  And second, David, this restoring faith in government is often used in political campaigns, but in New York, with the dysfunction at the state level, with the concerns, legitimate concerns about the governor's ability to govern, the concern that many in New York have even about members of Congress, and then when you couple that with a backdrop, which is a massive backdrop of what's happening here in Washington, as much as I appreciate the conversation here this morning, it's intellectual, it's informed, frankly it's the right kind of conversation, but for most Americans they tune it out."
199,"MR. LOWRY:  Oh, stop, Harold.  You're just buttering us up."
200,"REP. FORD:  They tune it out because it's all about, it's all about a process that they want to know how does this process result in better opportunities and a better security and a better future for me?  That's what's missing."
201,"MR. GREGORY:  Could you have won the primary, do you think?"
202,"REP. FORD:  I believe we could have.  But it would have been such a personal and ugly one, I did not want to find myself in the position of helping a Republican to win a seat in New York, which, at the end of the day, could determine the majority makeup of the United States  Senate at  the end of the year."
203,"MR. GREGORY:  But now that you, now that you won't challenge her, do you endorse Senator Gillibrand?  Will you campaign for her?  Are you 100 percent behind her?"
204,"REP. FORD:  There'll come a time when all those questions will have to be answered.  I've not been asked, I've not spoken with Senator Gillibrand, but I'm a Democrat, I'm an independent Democrat, as I shared at the bottom of the column that you, that you put up for the singular reason that I believe that when people give politicians jobs, it's a very special responsibility.  And if you don't take it seriously, which is one of the reasons why I think Governor Paterson has to think very seriously about whether or not he can govern, because if you cannot govern, the very special responsibility voters have bestowed upon you, if you can't live up to it, you should put it aside and move on and allow someone else to do it."
205,MR. GREGORY:  Should the governor step down?
206,"REP. FORD:  If he can't govern, which I don't know how as I think about it, as I assess it, I don't know how you govern in this, in this, in this arrangement, or for that matter in this climate.  When you consider that not only the dysfunction, but the fact that the budget is due in less than a month, when you consider the fact that almost half the voters in the state believe he should step down, how do you govern in that kind of an environment? It's a question he'll have to answer."
207,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let's talk not just about Governor Paterson, who, of course, is the governor of New York, is facing a number of investigations on ethics issues and whether he intervened into a domestic dispute, you've also got Charlie Rangel, Rich Lowry, who stepped down as head of the Ways and Means Committed amid ethics probes and an admonishment from the Ethics Committee. And Eric Massa of New York will be stepping down as well because of an allegation that he harassed a male aide.  What does this mean in this midterm year for Democrats in an already difficult climate?"
208,"MR. LOWRY:  Well, it just adds fuel to the anti-Washington fire, obviously. And I agree with what Harold was saying.  The, the very worst thing for a politician or for a political party is to--the appearance that they're not listening.  And I think that's the risk now to Democrats on health care because they're going ahead no matter what, and I think it's the risk on the economy because they haven't really pivoted the jobs, as President Obama put it at the beginning of the year.  And on the ethics, you know, it's beginning to, to look a lot like 2006, and I think Nancy Pelosi, she came in talking about the most ethical Congress ever, but really didn't have any commitment to taking on the old bulls in her party, which have been very difficult.  There's the late John Murtha, who personified the unseemly practices around earmarks. And you have Charlie Rangel, who I think's just a very sad case of someone who, who thinks he deserved a lifestyle beyond his congressional income and began to cut corners.  So human nature is taking its revenge."
209,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, we're talking about performance as well, among Democrats and the president. "
210,"And, Senator Hatch, the Republican National Committee, the finance director did a PowerPoint presentation to donors and the like, and I'll put it up on the screen, and this is what it included.  This was the imagery of how to run against the Democrats.  It had this, this offensive picture of the president and socialism, where he's the Joker from the film, and had other unflattering images of Democratic leaders.  Is this the way Republicans are going to get back into power?"
211,"SEN. HATCH:  There's no excuse for that type of stuff.  I, I just don't agree with that type of thing.  You know, I, I think if more Democrats were like Harold Ford, we wouldn't have half the problems that we have today.  They're open--he's open, he's willing to discuss, he's willing--he realizes it takes two parties on very, very important legislation to, to, to make things work. I don't agree with that type of stuff and some--the way I understand it, some junior guy there raising funds tried that as a fundraising tool, and..."
212,"MR. GREGORY:  I don't know how junior he was.  He was a finance
director."
213,SEN. HATCH:  Well...
214,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think Chairman Steele...
215,"SEN. HATCH:  That's junior to me, but the fact of the matter is..."
216,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
217,"SEN. HATCH:  ...that it shouldn't have happened.  I don't want to condemn somebody, but the fact of the matter is that I'm, I'm ashamed of that."
218,"MR. GREGORY:  Should Michael Steele, should he--should Michael Steele remain as head of the RNC when this kind of thing is going on?"
219,"SEN. HATCH:  I don't think Michael Steele knew about that.  If he did, I would be very concerned.  I like Michael Steele.  I think..."
220,MR. GREGORY:  You have confidence in him?
221,"SEN. HATCH:  I do.  I think he's a very fine guy.  Yeah, there--he's made mistakes like everybody does, but, but he's a good face for our party.  I think he's articulate, he's smart, he has a lot on the ball.  He's going to get criticized no matter what he does, but he was one of the first to come out and say that was, that was irresponsible."
222,"MR. GREGORY:  E.J., healthcare reform, whether it's success or failure, what's it going to mean for the midterm race?"
223,"MR. DIONNE:  First of all, I think when Harold Ford goes back to Tennessee and runs for the Senate, he's going to use that endorsement from Senator Hatch."
224,"REP. FORD:  E.J., I'll, I'll--when I run again, it'll be from New York,
which is where I live."
225,"MR. DIONNE:  I think you've got a very powerful endorsement in Tennessee. Healthcare reform, I think, really is everything for the Democrats this year because I think..."
226,REP. FORD:  I agree.
227,"MR. DIONNE:  ...you've seen a year in which they--the country's discouraged by the economy.  Any--I think any president would be in trouble--Ronald Reagan was in trouble with this level of unemployment. And they had, it was very hard to get through this Congress.  And
that's why I think it will ultimately pass because they've got to show they can govern.  And my view also is once you have a health bill that does particular things, people can say, you know, there are no more rescissions. Immediately, your kids can stay on the family health insurance policy till they're 26.  There are a lot of specific things in here that people can go out to defend.  You can only defend a proposal once it's out there.  And I think it'll be a much better debate when we can argue about a real thing and say what's this doing for people. And
yes, Harold Ford's right, jobs is the issue."
228,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Senator Hatch, I have 30 seconds.  I do want to mention Iraq because it's an important day where there's elections in Iraq."
229,"SEN. HATCH:  Yes, sir."
230,"MR. GREGORY:  There has been some violence, as we've seen--we see the aftermath pictures of that.  Still a very delicate democracy."
231,SEN. HATCH:  It is.
232,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think the United States should stick to its timetable for complete troop withdrawal?
233,"SEN. HATCH:  Well, let's put it this way, I think there's more evidence that this is working, more evidence that they're now--they now have a government, more evidence they are interested in voting, more evidence that, that this country can survive.  And we ought to do everything in our power to make sure that continues.  And I'm for doing that, just making sure that continues. It's a real good thing for the Middle East, and I am very supportive of it."
234,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We're going to leave it there.  Thank you, everyone here, for this lively discussion.  And we'll be right back."
235,(Announcements)
236,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  That's all for today.  I'll be away next Sunday, but Tom Brokaw will be here in my place.  Among his guests, former senior adviser to President Bush Karl Rove.  He's got the new book coming out called ""Courage and Consequence"" about his time as a conservative and his time in the White House.  Plus a political roundtable, including New York Times columnists David Brooks and Tom Friedman.  That's right here next week."

        MR. TOM BROKAW:  This Sunday:  Critical condition.  President Obama delays his trip overseas to push hard for healthcare reform.
    "
1,(Videotape)
2,PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  It's time to vote!  Tired of talking about it.
3,(End videotape)
4,"MR. BROKAW:  Will he finally succeed on this top priority?  We'll ask the president's senior adviser, David Axelrod."
5,"Then, counting the votes."
6,(Videotape)
7,REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC):  I'm convinced that we'll have the votes to pass it.
8,(End videotape)
9,"MR. BROKAW:  Will Democratic leaders be able to persuade enough members of their own party to support the controversial legislation?  We'll ask the two men charged with rounding up those votes, House Democratic Whip James Clyburn and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin."
10,"And he's the man many credit with President George W. Bush's rise to the White House.  Now he's the author of a new memoir, ""Courage and Consequence,"" former senior adviser to President Bush Karl Rove.  He joins us to discuss his role in the Bush administration and much more."
11,"And fallout from the vice president's trip to Israel.  How will that impact the Middle East peace process?  Insights and analysis from two noted New York Times columnists, David Brooks and Tom Friedman. "
12,"MR. TOM BROKAW:  But first, is the president on the brink of finally getting health care passed?  With us now this morning, his senior adviser, David Axelrod, who's in the member of--in the middle of all these intersections."
13,"Mr. Axelrod, very nice to have you with us."
14,MR. DAVID AXELROD:  Thanks for having me.
15,"MR. BROKAW:  I think it'll be helpful to the American public if we give them a kind of a road map of what we can expect in the days and maybe even the weeks ahead from a procedural point of view, because it's pretty confusing. Even congressional parliamentarians are having a hard time explaining this one.  So let us take you through now what we can expect. First,  the House will be voting on the Senate bill, which was approved in December.  The House will then also vote on a package of changes via reconciliation.  That's a procedure that they can get passed on a majority vote mostly to do with budget items.  The president then would
sign the Senate health bill if it gets passed.  The Senate passes the House's package of changes from reconciliation with a simple majority vote, and then the president would sign the reconciliation bill.  I think if you're out there, you're wondering--especially when you know the
healthcare bill is 2,700 pages all together--what does this mean for me in the final analysis?  The president has given 52 speeches on this subject.  How do you find yourself now in such a kerfuffle at the end of a year? "
16,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, I don't know if it's a kerfluffle, but I'm--it's good to have that word back in the, in the mix.  Look, I--Tom, the one thing I'm sure of is that the American people don't know or care much about the sequencing of parliamentary procedures.  They want an up or down vote after a year-long debate to bring this to a close.  And I think the sense of urgency has increased in recent weeks because we've seen rate increases across the country for health insurance:  39 percent in California, up to 60 percent in my home state of Illinois.  We're going to Ohio tomorrow in part because the president got a letter from a woman named Natoma Canfield.  Natoma Canfield was someone who had insurance in the individual market; she didn't get it through her job. She paid through the nose for it.  She was paying $6,000 a year, and it didn't cover much.  And she finally had to give it up at the end of last year 
because she was afraid she would have to--she had to choose between her house and her insurance.  She was just diagnosed with leukemia, and now she has no insurance and her house is in jeopardy.  Anyway, this shouldn't happen in the United States of America.  That's what this is about, not about procedure.  It's about what are we going to do to protect the American people and give them the security they deserve?"
17,"MR. BROKAW:  I understand that, but they have to know what the procedure is before they know what comes out the other end.  And the--and a lot of people, including your friends, now have real doubts about the president's agenda and his ability to manage that efficiently in the
course of the last year.  Here was the article in The New Yorker magazine, which is generally sympathetic to this administration, saying, ""The president's failure to connect to ordinary Americans"" in the last year.  Scott Brown, the senator from Massachusetts who was elected by running against you with the Republican who was speaking yesterday to the nation on radio, here's what he had to say about your priorities."
18,"(Videotape, Saturday)"
19,"SEN. SCOTT BROWN (R-MA):  Maybe you remember what President Obama promised in his State of the Union address.  He said he was going to finally focus on jobs and the economy for the remainder of this year.  I applauded him for that. Well, here it is, it's almost spring and what is he out there talking about again?  That same 2,700-page multitrillion-dollar healthcare legislation."
20,(End videotape)
21,"MR. BROKAW:  You're going to be hearing that a lot from Republicans, not just in the weeks and months to come, but in the fall during the election time. What is the least that the president will accept for a healthcare reform bill at the end of this procedure?"
22,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, first of all, let me say, Tom, that it's interesting to hear Senator Brown make those points because he, of course, comes from Massachusetts where they enacted a healthcare reform with many of the same principles that are animating the, the, the proposal the president has advanced, and 70 percent of the people in his state say they're well satisfied with that plan.  Senator Brown voted for it when he was in the legislature; he says he wouldn't repeal it.  We just want to give the rest of America the same opportunity."
23,"We've been concentrating, though, on the economy from the very beginning. The same people who are saying ""You're not concentrating on the economy"" walked away from our efforts to shore up the economy at the beginning of this administration, and those efforts are, you know, are beginning to show results.  We have a long way to go because this recession has been
terribly devastating for this country, eight and a half million jobs lost, but we--we're, we're--we believe still that jobs are going to begin growing in this spring.  The, the, the free fall that was under way when we took office has now been arrested.  So--and we just now are passing
through the House and Senate additional jobs measures.  And, and, to his credit, Senator Brown joined with us, one of the few Republicans who joined with us, on one of those measures.  So when you're president of the United States and you take office in the middle of a crisis, you have to be able to do many things at once, not one thing."
24,MR. BROKAW:  Let's go back to health care for just a moment.  Will the president accept a healthcare bill that includes some restrictions on abortion coverage?
25,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, the president's view, and he stated it from the beginning of this process, is that this bill should not be the occasion to, to change the, the law of the land.  The law of the land right now is that federal funds should not be used for abortion services.  There's
nothing in the proposal that he's advanced, there's nothing in what would be approved by the Congress that would upset the existing status quo, and that's as, that's as it should be.  If there's going to be a debate on that issue, it should not be in the, in the, in the, in the course of this debate."
26,"MR. BROKAW:  As a man who's run a lot of campaigns, can't you understand the anxiety of a lot of Democrats, in the House especially, who have to vote on the Senate bill, even though reconciliation comes next to try to fix parts of it, when they know that when they go back in the fall it's that vote on the Senate bill, 2,700 pages, the ""Cornhusker Amendment,""
the ""Louisiana Purchase,"" all the Christmas tree ornaments that are in there that they'll be hearing about when they run for re-election? "
27,"MR. AXELROD:  Tom, the only way they're going to hear that if they run for re-election is if they--if this bill does not move forward.  I've said many times that they've got to vote that Republicans and the insurance industry and others can run against them already.  What they
don't have is the accomplishment.  If this bill passes this year, children with pre-existing conditions will now be covered, there'll be an end to lifetime caps and annual caps on what the insurance companies will cover, so if you get sick you won't go broke, if you get sick they can't
throw you off your insurance.  The doughnut hole will be filled in so senior citizens will save hundreds of dollars on their prescription drugs, the life of Medicare will be extended, and on and on and on. "
28,"So if the Republican Party wants to go out and say to that child who now has insurance or say to that small business that will get tax credits this year, if he signs the bill, to help their employees get, get health care, if they want to say to them, ""You know what, we're, we're actually going to take that away from you.  We don't think that's such a good idea,"" I say let's have that fight, make my day, I'm ready to have that, and every member of Congress ought to be willing to have that debate as well."
29,"MR. BROKAW:  And how sure can you be about the cost of this healthcare bill? Just like in war, when you pass legislation, the first thing to go after contact is the budget estimates or what the exact costs are going to be."
30,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, Tom, you know, as you know, the Congressional Budget Office, which both parties have a great deal of respect for, have said that the, the proposals will save $100 billion on the deficits this year, perhaps a trillion or more--not this year, this decade, and next decade perhaps a trillion or more.  And most healthcare experts believe those are, those are conservative estimates because there are a lot of cost-saving measures built into this plan, and no one quite knows how they'll work.  So they've made a conservative estimate of, of what the savings will be.  This bill will help us achieve fiscal responsibility in this country.  But biggest driving cost for the federal government is health care.  And unless we do something to change--to, as the economists say, to bend the cost curve and build economies into our healthcare system, we're going to have a huge problem down the line."
31,MR. BROKAW:  The president's already canceled one trip.  Is he prepared to cancel all planned travel until he gets healthcare reform finished?
32,"MR. AXELROD:  I am--the speaker said there'll be a vote this week.  I believe there will be a vote this week.  Your next guests can speak to this.  I think there is a determination on the part of members of Congress, after a yearlong debate in which Republican ideas and Democratic ideas were incorporated into this legislation, the best thinking of both parties, that it's time to bring this to a close."
33,MR. BROKAW:  And you're going to get it passed.  And you're going to get it passed.
34,MR. AXELROD:  I'm confident.
35,MR. BROKAW:  Totally confident?
36,"MR. AXELROD:  I am absolutely confident that we are going to be successful. I believe we are--we, we--that there is a sense of urgency on the part of members of Congress who have now seen what the future looks like in terms of these rate increases, who have stories like the one I
told you of Natoma Canfield, multiplied by millions, and they hear them every day.  I believe they want to solve this problem."
37,"MR. BROKAW:  Very quickly, as we leave here, what was the president's reaction to the Israeli government announcing 1,600 new settlements in East Jerusalem at a time when Vice President Biden was there on a trip to try to express to the Israelis the importance of moving forward with the peace process?"
38,"MR. AXELROD:  I think both the vice president and the secretary of State reflected the president's thinking.  This was an affront, it was an insult, but most importantly, it undermined this very fragile effort to bring peace to that region.  We just now have started proximity talks;
that is, shuttle diplomacy between the Arab--between the Palestinians and the Israelis.  And for this announcement to come at that time was very, very destructive."
39,"MR. BROKAW:  Why didn't the president pick up the phone and call ""Bibi"" Netanyahu on..."
40,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, the vice president was right there to convey the president's view.  The secretary of State conveyed that view.  The ambassador was called to the State Department and our views were made clear to them.  And I know the prime minister spoke to this this morning after his Cabinet meeting.  I think the message was received."
41,"MR. BROKAW:  David Axelrod, senior policy adviser to the president, who's been in the news himself here recently.  We'll talk about that on another occasion."
42,MR. AXELROD:  OK.
43,MR. BROKAW:  Thanks very much for being with us.
44,"MR. AXELROD:  Thanks, Tom.  Thanks for having me."
45,"MR. BROKAW:  OK, David, thank you."
46,"MR. TOM BROKAW:  Joining us now, let's turn to two men whose job it is to count the votes in their respective chambers--the Democratic House whip, Congressman James Clyburn of South Carolina; the Democratic Senate whip, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois."
47,"Welcome both.  They're back in their respective states.  You just heard Mr. Axelrod say that he is confident, Congressman Clyburn, that the bill will be passed.  As of this morning, do you have the votes that you need? "
48,"REP. CLYBURN:  No, we don't have them as of this morning.  But we've been working this thing all weekend, we'll be working it going into the week. I am also very confident that we'll get this done.  I have been talking to members for a long time on this, and they have the will to do it.
They've been looking to us to create a way to do it.  I think we have gotten to a place where we do have the way to do it, and I think the members are going to, to vote for this."
49,MR. BROKAW:  What is the way that they can get it done?  Because I'm hearing from a number of people on Capitol Hill and other political analysts that members of the House are very anxious about voting for the Senate bill and then having that read back to them in the fall by their Republican opponents who would then ignore whatever happens in reconciliation?
50,"REP. CLYBURN:  Well, I hear a lot of that, and there is this historic distrust that exists between the two bodies.  But I believe sincerely that we have been working together, the House and Senate leaders, along with the White House.  I think we have gotten a comfort level with each
other.  I think that we can go to our members and say to them with assurances that the Senate wants to fix this as well as we do.  They know back in the--their states that people need this reform.  We need to get rid of discrimination because of pre-existing conditions.  We need to get rid of recisions when people get catastrophic illnesses.  We need to say
to young people, ""You can stay on your parents' insurance policies until you finished law school or medical school,"" what have you.  These things we have got to do, and the senators know that. And we cannot do all of that without this bill."
51,"MR. BROKAW:  Senator Durbin, a lot of members of the House are looking to  the Senate, and they're looking with some skepticism about what you'll do to the bill once it gets back into your chamber.  Let me share with you now what New York Congressman Anthony Weiner had to say about all that. ""Members of the House are being asked to trust an untrustworthy body.
...  I think there are a lot of skeptical members about whether the Senate, [the Senate] can deliver on the things that they say that they are going to."" Can you give an ironclad guarantee this morning to Congressman Weiner and other members of the House that the Senate will play by the rules and keep intact the bill that is passed in the House?"
52,"SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL):  Tom, when I served in the House, we used to say in the House Democratic Caucus, ""The Republicans are our opponents, but the Senate is the enemy."" So I can understand the built-in skepticism and lack of trust.  But I'll tell you this, we're in the process of actually contacting every single Democratic senator.  When Nancy Pelosi goes
before her House Democratic Caucus, it will be with the solid assurance that when reconciliation comes over to the Senate side, we're going to pass it."
53,"MR. BROKAW:  When you go among your constituents in Illinois, Senator, do they have any idea what's in the 2,700 pages of this health bill?"
54,"SEN. DURBIN:  Well, some do.  But a lady called me--I was in Springfield yesterday at the office, and a woman called on a Saturday from Nokomis, Illinois, and she said, ""I want you to be against this bill, Senator. It, it's just, it's government health insurance."" And then she went on to explain that her mother, her 85-year-old mother, just went to a great local hospital for a surgery under Medicare.  And I explained to her this is a government health insurance plan.  And I said, are you worried about insurance rates going up?  And she said, ""Well, yes I am."" And I said, ""That's what we're trying to do--deal with, to make sure that small businesses can afford health insurance, that they have the same options that members of Congress have to choose from different health insurance companies, the best choice, real competition.  We want to start bringing costs down for everybody.  And we want to give people a fighting chance
against insurance companies that turn them down because of pre-existing conditions and caps on the amounts that they pay."" So I'm not sure I'll ever win her over, but I think we are addressing a very serious problem. The Republicans have not helped us.  They want to stop; they want to give up.  But we're not giving up on the American people.  This is an important battle, and the president's right, we've got to win it for families and small businesses all across America."
55,"MR. BROKAW:  When the Senate bill is reported out of the Senate at some point, if it is, will it have stripped out of it the so-called ""Cornhusker Amendment,"" the special consideration to Senator Ben Nelson? Or what is called the ""Louisiana Purchase,"" the special consideration for
Louisiana?"
56,"SEN. DURBIN:  Well, what Senator Nelson said is he wanted good treatment for Nebraska, but he hoped every state would get it.  And the reconciliation bill will extend the Nebraska treatment to every state in the union.  As far as the situation in Louisiana, let me tell you, Mary Landrieu fought for that because she has a situation that comes out of Hurricane Katrina that's one of the worst in the nation where every county has been declared an emergency disaster area.  If that happens at her state or in any other state, we ought to step up and help them.  Mary Landrieu's right to fight for Louisiana.  She's doing the right thing. And we ought to offer that kind of assistance to any state that deals with that kind of emergency."
57,"MR. BROKAW:  Congressman Clyburn, as you know, there is another issue that could be a sticking point, and that is the question about what kind of coverage people who want to have an abortion would be able to get. Congressman Stupak of Michigan, a conservative Democrat, has been leading the fight to restrict coverage for abortion, and he told the National
Review Online this past weekend, ""What are Democratic leaders saying? `If you pass the Stupak amendment, more children will be born, and therefore it will cost us millions more.  That's one of the arguments I've been hearing,' [Stupak] says.  `Money is their hang-up.  Is this how we now value life in America?  If money is the issue, come on, we can find room in the budget.  This is a life that we are talking about.'"" He later amended his remarks to say it was not Democratic leaders, but members of the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives that he was referring to.  Are you going to cede to Congressman Stupak and
keep some restrictions on abortion coverage?"
58,"REP. CLYBURN:  I think that Congressman Stupak, who is one of my best friends in the Congress--we were classmates and we spend a lot of time together--I think he is operating in earnest when he says that he wants to see us restrict federal funds for abortion.  I believe we have done that.  I think that more people that look at this, we have just had the Catholic hospitals to endorse this bill.  I don't think they would be doing that if they were not comfortable with this language.  We have seen legal experts last week say they have scrubbed it, and they really believe that what the Senate has done is in keeping with the Hyde Amendment that we've been operating under for years now. There will be no federal funds for abortion.  And I think that most people that look at this have now come to that conclusion.  And I do believe that Congressman Stupak will end up voting for this bill because I think he's going to be very comfortable with it in the coming days."
59,"MR. BROKAW:  Congressman Clyburn and Senator Durbin, it's not just Republicans who've been critical of the president.  The 43-member Congressional Black Caucus is fighting through one of the most difficult periods in its 39 history--39-year history, according to its members. The House Judiciary Committee chairman, John Conyers, told Politico that White House officials are ""not listening"" to black lawmakers.  Representative Alcee Hastings of Florida:  ""There's not enough attention to poor people."" Representative Jesse Jackson Jr.  said:  ""While I respect President Obama, delivering victories for his political future should be the least of our worries on Capitol Hill."" They're talking mostly about jobs and aid for poor people."
60,"Can you assure the Congressional Black Congress--Caucus and also the American people, that by July of this year the American economy will begin to create more jobs than it begins to lose?  Congressman Clyburn: "
61,"REP. CLYBURN:  I don't know if I can offer that assurance as I can tell you this, I'm very comfortable that they will.  For the last two report periods, we have remained stable at 9.7 percent.  We have just passed a jobs bill in the House, and we are going to pass another one in the House and the Senate in the coming days.  I do feel that we are on course to get this economy moving again.  I had a meeting, along with the Congressional Black Caucus, with the president three, four days ago.  It was a very cordial meeting, one of the most productive meetings I've ever had at the White House.  I do believe that we're all on the same page
when it comes to providing health care and creating jobs in this economy. And so I'm very comfortable with the relationship that the president has with the Congressional Black Caucus, and I think we are going to be moving forward together."
62,"MR. BROKAW:  And, Senator Durbin, can you make that assurance to the people of Illinois that there will begin to be job creation by late spring, early July?"
63,"SEN. DURBIN:  This is what I can tell them:  If the Republican senators will stop the filibusters, stop the obstruction, come across the aisle and help us, we can pass bills that will really create jobs in America and do it quickly. We want to help small businesses with tax credits to
hire unemployed people. We want to move into clean energy technology, which is going to create jobs across America.  The only way we get it done in the Senate is if some senators on the Republican side have the courage to step up and join us.  You talked about Scott Brown earlier. One of his first votes was to come across the aisle and help us move a jobs bill.  Senator Snowe, Senator Collins, several of these senators have shown extraordinary courage.  We need more of them. With that bipartisan cooperation, we can start to get this economy moving forward. Without it, we're going to be tangled up in filibusters and obstructions and obstacles.  That isn't going to create a job in America."
64,"MR. BROKAW:  Congressman Clyburn, Senator Durbin, thanks very much for being with us this morning.  We'll be watching very carefully in the course of the next several weeks for this vote on healthcare reform."
65,"Up next, a Republican view..."
66,REP. CLYBURN:  Thank you so much for having us.
67,"MR. BROKAW:  ...from a controversial and key figure in the Bush administration, now author of the new book ""Courage and Consequence."" Karl Rove gives us his take on the White House years and what's next for the GOP. Then, insights and analysis from our political roundtable, New York Times columnists Tom Friedman and David Brooks, only on MEET THE PRESS."
68,(Announcements)
69,"MR. BROKAW:  Karl Rove, plus our roundtable with Tom Friedman and David Brooks, after this brief commercial break."
70,(Announcements)
71,"MR. TOM BROKAW:  We're back and joined now by the man many people called ""Bush's Brain."" The president called him his ""architect."" Other people in the opposition called him names that we can't repeat here on a Sunday morning. Karl Rove, author of a book now called ""Courage and Consequence,"" about the Bush years and his life in American politics."
72,"Welcome, Mr. Rove.  Nice to have you with us."
73,MR. KARL ROVE:  Thanks for having me.
74,"MR. BROKAW:  Let's get right to the business of the day here in Washington, D.C., the president's healthcare reform plan.  Is he making the same mistake that you did at the beginning of your second term when you launched Social Security reform before you had all the ducks in order, even in your own party, and had fully explained it to the American public?"
75,"MR. ROVE:  Well, there are differences and there are similarities.  The big difference is we made an effort to build a bipartisan consensus by appointing in 2001 a commission headed by former New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, equal number of Republicans and Democrats, to find ways that they could recommend to Congress to save Social Security.  So we had done something which this administration's not done, which is attempt to lay a bipartisan predicate for the bill.  But they have taken on something that they have not been engaged in, which is really remarkable. The president gave one bipartisan, bicameral meeting on the 5th of last
March.  His next dip into those waters by bringing people from both parties and both houses down to the White House to discuss the issue is February 25th of this year, 51 weeks later.  Much of this has been outsourced to Congress, and the president looks aloof and disengaged.
And it's a, it's a very contentious issue, as you know."
76,"MR. BROKAW:  Well, he's changed that now because he's delayed his trip to Indonesia, he's putting the pressure on Democratic leaders.  If they get a bill and it is a pared down bill, will the Republicans continue to run against this come the fall, no matter what?"
77,"MR. ROVE:  Well, it's not going to be a pared down bill.  They're going to pass this obnoxious Senate bill that was approved by the Senate on Christmas Eve that is stuffed with pork and is a bill that the American  people--this is pretty remarkable.  If you step back for a minute, it's a
pretty remarkable year that we've had, the, the concept of healthcare reform had a 2-to-1 advantage when the process begin a year ago.  Today, if you ask over the last couple of weeks these questions and polls about do you approve of the bill President Obama and the Democrats are pushing, it is 60 percent disapprove, 38 percent approve.  If you average all
those poll questions again, that's a pretty remarkable decline in support when the president has dominated the stage with 52 addresses, including, you know, a--two addresses to the congressional--to, to Congress."
78,"MR. BROKAW:  But the fact of the matter is we don't know the exact definition of the final bill because it'll go through this complicated process, get to reconciliation, some of the costs will be addressed then."
79,"MR. ROVE:  Right.  And, and isn't that amazing?  We're asking people of the U.S. House, House of Representatives not to vote on the bill but to vote on a placeholder.  And the final terms of this huge measure affecting one-sixth of our economy will be defined later, perhaps in a,
in a bill in the Senate designed to circumvent the normal order of business.  That's a pretty remarkable way to try and go pass a big piece of legislation without bipartisan support."
80,"MR. BROKAW:  Is there anything that can neutralize a Republican attack on this bill in the fall, say, a vast improvement in the job picture?"
81,"MR. ROVE:  No.  There, there--look, there's a way for them to get the, the American people back on their side, the administration has ways, but it would involve stepping back from this bill and instead taking the more popular parts of it and beginning to move it as a series of measures over the course in the next six months."
82,"MR. BROKAW:  Let me talk about your book, ""Courage and Consequence."" You spent a lot of time obviously on the Iraq war."
83,MR. ROVE:  Mm-hmm.
84,"MR. BROKAW:  And in it, you acknowledge when weapons of mass destruction were not found, everyone was startled and not very happy about that.  If that had been the case before war began, you couldn't have gotten congressional authorization."
85,"MR. ROVE:  Nor, nor in all likelihood U.N. approval as we had as well. "
86,MR. BROKAW:  Would you have launched the war if you had not known there were weapons of mass destruction?
87,"MR. ROVE:  Well, as I say in the book, I--we would not have had either the authorization from Congress nor the U.N., and we probably would have found--had to find--we would have found other ways to constrain his behavior."
88,MR. BROKAW:  But let's share a tape now with Vice President Cheney.  This is the beginning of his debate in October of 2004 when he was debating John Edwards.  Here's what he had to say about what the administration would have done.
89,"(Videotape, October 5, 2004)"
90,"VICE PRES. DICK CHENEY:  What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do.  If I had it to recommend all over again, I would recommend exactly the right same course of action."
91,(End videotape)
92,"MR. BROKAW:  So that sounds like he was prepared to go to war, weapons of mass destruction or not."
93,"MR. ROVE:  Well, I'm, I'm surprised you didn't put up the, the, the piece of tape of John Kerry saying much the same thing in September of 2004 where he said knowing what he knew today--he was asked, ""If you know what you knew today, would you have voted for the war?"" And he said, ""Yes, I would have."""
94,MR. BROKAW:  But we're talking about your administration and this vice president...
95,MR. ROVE:  I know.  But...
96,MR. BROKAW:  ...and what he said.
97,"MR. ROVE:  I know.  But, but--and I know you don't want to talk about the fact that for once John, John Kerry and Dick Cheney agree that they would have both supported the authorization of the use of force resolution. I'm merely making the point that had there not been this widespread consensus, Democrat and Republican, throughout the intelligence
community, there--we would not have been able to get the authorization for the use of force, nor would we have gotten the U.N. resolution. "
98,"MR. BROKAW:  Now, Mr. Rove, there was also sharp criticism, and justified from a lot of quarters, of the management of the war once you did go to war. The insurgency was more swiftly activated on the part of those Islamics who wanted to fight back.  We were not greeted as liberators beyond the first couple of days.  We didn't have enough troops to provide
internal security. The cost of the war skyrocketed almost from the beginning.  There was not a sharing of the oil revenues that a lot of people had promised, including the, the vice president."
99,"MR. ROVE:  I--let me correct you.  There--you put down a lot of things here. I'll be happy to deal with them serially or together whichever you like.  But, for example, on that one, the administration emphatically said that this was not about oil.  And we thought right from the
beginning..."
100,"MR. BROKAW:  No, no, no, not about oil, but it was about..."
101,MR. ROVE:  Let me finish.
102,"MR. BROKAW:  ...how it would--we would share oil revenue, and it would help offset the cost of the war."
103,"MR. ROVE:  No.  No, no.  Tom, with all due respect, that was not the policy of our government that we were going to go into Iraq and take their resource in order to, to, to pay for the costs of the war. "
104,MR. BROKAW:  But it would be part of the consequence of getting the country stabilized.
105,"MR. ROVE:  No.  Well, part of the consequence would be that, that Saddam Hussein, who used the oil market to manipulate prices and deny supplies to the West, would no longer be in a position to do that.  But the suggestion that somehow or another the administration had as its policy, ""We're going to go into Iraq and take their resource and pay for the war"" is not reality."
106,"MR. BROKAW:  I, I didn't say that.  What I said was that there would be an oil-sharing and the revenue from that would help offset the cost of the war. And I didn't say it was a principal factor, but it was part of the larger scheme."
107,"MR. ROVE:  No.  With all due respect, we're simply going to disagree on this. There--if you wanted to..."
108,"MR. BROKAW:  Well, let's talk about the insurgency."
109,MR. ROVE:  Right.
110,"MR. BROKAW:  I was in Iraq right before the war began.  Everybody who briefed me said, you know, ""We've been talking to the Iraqi generals, they're going to put their weapons in a circle, we're going to be able to move in here,"" and then the first thing that happens there are white
pickup trucks racing across Iraq fighting back.  That was completely unanticipated, we had utter chaos in Baghdad and most of the major cities."
111,"MR. ROVE:  Well, you generally do have utter chaos when you have a major conflict like this.  But it--look, I think it is reasonable to, to say that, that, that the planning could have been better.  But on the other hand, very rarely do plans survive the first contact with the enemy.  And the big problem in this one was that the enemy in, in al-Qaeda decided in the--and with the onset of democracy, they said, ""Democracy will strangle us,"" Zarqawi said to his leaders.  And they began in 2006, two and a half years after the war, to try and inspire sectarian violence, and that's when violence really began to, to, to grow.  And it's a reminder that the
enemy gets a vote in this and we have to be nimble, as we were with the surge which countered that."
112,"MR. BROKAW:  Part of the reason that they were able to respond and that they were nimble is that we allowed the dissolution of a Baathist army, and it was not worked out very strategically at all, and we left the entire western part of the country open because we couldn't get the 4th ID to come in from Turkey."
113,"MR. ROVE:  Well--and look, again, a--we had a plan to get the 4th ID into, into Iraq."
114,"MR. BROKAW:  But it didn't work, and we went to war anyway. "
115,"MR. ROVE:  Well, I, I--that's my point is is that, that a, a battle plan rarely survives intact its first contact with reality.  And the fact of the matter is you have to plan for the best and sometimes you don't get your plans, a la Turkey denying at the last minute the entry of the 4th ID into western Iraq."
116,"MR. BROKAW:  I want to do something what they call in the game show business ""the lightning round,"" get your reaction to some political developments. Sarah Palin be a strong presidential candidate for your party in the next term?"
117,MR. ROVE:  There are several geological agents that are going to come and go before the next contest heats up.  This is her year to get ready for the hot spotlight that will fall on her if she wants to be a presidential candidate.
118,MR. BROKAW:  Do you think that she can and wants to get ready?
119,"MR. ROVE:  I don't know if she wants to, and she certainly can.  She was a vice presidential nominee and did, did very well on the 63 days she was on the national stage between coming out in Ohio and the election day. "
120,"MR. BROKAW:  Of the tea party and Glenn Beck, one of your colleagues at Fox News, they're critical, not just of Democrats and spending, but also of the Republican Party..."
121,MR. ROVE:  Mm-hmm.
122,MR. BROKAW:  ...during the Bush term for not controlling spending as well. Is there a danger to your party that the tea party will become the Ross Perot of the next election cycle?
123,"MR. ROVE:  Well, and it'll require Ross Perot, a deep pockets, iconoclastic figure like Ross Perot.  I don't see so.  I think that it is a movement that has energized Democrats, Republicans, and a lot of independents to be deeply concerned about the spending and the deficits, the debt and the growth of government power, particularly under President Obama.  And right now they're going to, they're going to exact their revenge this fall, and it's not going to be pretty for Democrats."
124,"MR. BROKAW:  You have a pretty vivid description of that weekend in which Vice President Cheney accidentally shot, not just his lawyer, but your lawyer as well."
125,"MR. ROVE:  Well, it wasn't his lawyer, it was my lawyer."
126,MR. BROKAW:  It was your lawyer.
127,MR. ROVE:  And my personal--his personal friend and my personal friend.
128,"MR. BROKAW:  And you heard about it on Saturday, but it didn't get out until late Sunday afternoon, in part because the vice president let his host decide how they would release that through a Corpus Christi newspaper.  And then you say, ""The incident taught me that the vice
president could be stubborn and unmovable and that he detested the press."" Is that the first time you thought that Dick Cheney could be stubborn..."
129,"MR. ROVE:  No, but, but..."
130,MR. BROKAW:  ...and unmovable?
131,"MR. ROVE:  No, but, but this was particularly stubborn.  And, and look, I understand why he felt like he was obligated to his good friends, his hosts. This was a terrible situation that had occurred on their ranch, but it was not the--it was not in his best interests nor in the family's
best interests to have it--handled in this way."
132,"MR. BROKAW:  Throughout the book, you have some strong things to say about the press.  The press covering John McCain was ""starstruck,"" for example.  You describe a..."
133,MR. ROVE:  Which they were in 2000.
134,MR. BROKAW:  Well...
135,"MR. ROVE:  And by 2008 they weren't, were they?"
136,"MR. BROKAW:  Well, look, I'm not arguing, I'm just--I'm, I'm repeating what you say here."
137,MR. ROVE:  Right.
138,"MR. BROKAW:  You describe a Washington Post columnist as ""snarky."" You complain kind of consistently--and people in your position have done this for a long, long time--about the press coverage.  You're now at Fox News. Do you think that Fox News is fair to President Obama?"
139,"MR. ROVE:  I think they--on the news side, absolutely.  I think they've got first-rate individuals at the White House who do their job in as an objective, fair and balanced way.  Yeah, absolutely."
140,"MR. BROKAW:  You don't think that they have teed up, for example, the healthcare bill and are more selective in their coverage? "
141,"MR. ROVE:  No.  In fact, look, you've got to differentiate.  NBC, for example, has MSNBC, which has opinion people like, well, you know..."
142,"MR. BROKAW:  And the--at 6:00 at night, we do."
143,"MR. ROVE:  Right.  Yeah.  And, and, and also, you have some of those same people playing part of your news delivery at MSNBC, which would not happen at Fox.  I would--I--you know, I would not be put out there as, ""an objective journalist."""
144,MR. BROKAW:  But you appear on a regular basis...
145,MR. ROVE:  I do.
146,MR. BROKAW:  ...during the course of the news coverage during the day.
147,MR. ROVE:  I do.  And nobody--and they always go out of their way to make certain that people understand the context so they can take--make their own--they can put it through their own filter if they like.
148,"MR. BROKAW:  Karl Rove, thanks very much for being with us today."
149,MR. ROVE:  You bet.  You bet.  Thank you.
150,"MR. BROKAW:  You can read an excerpt of Karl's new book, ""Courage and Consequence,"" on our Web site at mtp.msnbc.com."
151,"Up next, fallout from the vice president's trip to the Middle East, and the week in Washington.  Our roundtable weighs in, David Brooks and Tom Friedman, here only on MEET THE PRESS."
152,(Announcements)
153,"MR. TOM BROKAW:  We're back now and joined by two very familiar figures on MEET THE PRESS, The New York Times columnists David Brooks and Tom Friedman."
154,Welcome to both of you.
155,"Let's begin with you, if we can, David.  There are lots of declarations that are being made in Washington this week, either apocalyptic, that this is the end of the Obama presidency, or it's the deliverance of the Obama presidency. Are they both exaggerated?"
156,"MR. DAVID BROOKS:  No.  No.  The, the White House has said, ""We're all in."" They're betting their whole presidency on getting this thing passed, or at least the first year of the presidency.  And they're behind.  There are 80-odd Democrats who are in, in Republican-held districts, and the votes aren't there yet, as, as Clyburn said today.  And there are blocs
of Democrats who are opposed to this thing.  There's a pro-life bloc, a cost-conscious bloc, then a couple who just want to keep their jobs. It's very easy to see how this goes down.  On the other hand, Nancy Pelosi's pretty good at this.  Barack Obama's pretty good at this.  So I
have to think it's at least 50/50 that they get it. "
157,"But what strikes me at the end of the day is we've elected another riverboat gambler.  President Obama is risking his presidency on a 50/50 chance.  Would you risk your house on a 50/50 chance?  I wouldn't.  And so like President Bush, we, we've elected a couple guys who have confidence and are willing to risk a lot on 50/50 chances.  The--you're the expert on this, but I happen to think guys who've been through World War II, that generation of leaders from Eisenhower to, say, Bob Dole, they wouldn't have taken that chance.  They knew what happened when the odds went bad.  But now we have a generation of presidents that love the
risk, that believe in themselves.  That makes me a little nervous."
158,"MR. BROKAW:  Tom, turn the clock back nine months.  Is this what you expected from President Obama in terms of managing his agenda and his administration?"
159,"MR. TOM FRIEDMAN:  You know, once he got through what he inherited, which was a, was a huge economic mess, it doesn't surprise me.  I mean, you know, why do you come to Washington?  Why do you want to be president?  I think it is to throw the big one.  So--and I, I, I think if he doesn't get this through, I really don't know what the rest of his presidency is
going to be about, not just in substance, but I think if this--if the Republicans can stop him on this, I think they think they can stop him on everything.  So it doesn't surprise me that he's, he's going for the long bomb here."
160,"MR. BROOKS:  Could--just to switch sports here, I mean, this is the debate they have in the White House.  My favorite sport is home runs or singles.  And they believe in home runs, or the long bomb.  I, I'm more of a singles guy.  I remember when the Mets had a guy named Dave Kingman who hit like 30 home runs a year and struck out like 500 times a year. I'm more--especially in a culture where people are so cynical about Washington, I think you hit a few singles, you go--you get that thing going so people'll have some faith in government, and then they can trust you a little more.  I, I'm just become very averse to this home run mentality."
161,"MR. BROKAW:  Well, one of the concerns that I have just as a citizen is I don't know how this healthcare bill, given its current construct, lands, eventually, out there in terms of the cost and how it works.  It strikes me, at this point, that it has some of the DNA of the Department of Homeland Security.  I mean, it's got all of these wings and branches and elements and other parts of it, and until you hit the trigger and put it out in the country, you don't know what the consequences are."
162,MR. BROOKS:  Yeah.
163,MR. BROKAW:  And that's a big part of this.
164,"MR. BROOKS:  Right.  I, I, I understand why people would be fervently for it. This will cover 30 million people.  That is a serious moral accomplishment.  I lean against because it will not slow the route of healthcare costs.  We now spend 17 percent of our economy on health care.
It'll go up to 20, 25.  All the stuff that I think is more important--education, infrastructure, competitiveness with China, the stuff Tom writes about--we won't have money for that.  And a lot of the deficit control is totally bogus.  We're have 10 years of, of revenue to pay for six years of costs.  We're--with the--it's really based on an excise tax, and that's gutted.  And so I'm really worried about the cost, and that's why I lean against right now."
165,"MR. BROKAW:  All right.  Let's talk about something else that was in the news this week and almost got overwhelmed by the healthcare reform except for the audacity of what it was.  Vice President Biden goes to Israel to have a high-level meeting with the prime minister to talk about trying to get the peace process started again.  While he is there, the Israeli government announces that they're going to build 1,600 new settlements in East Jerusalem. Tom, you had something to say about that.  The secretary of State had something to say about it.  We're going to begin by sharing her interview with Andrea Mitchell.  Here is Hillary Clinton."
166,"(Videotape, Friday)"
167,"MS. ANDREA MITCHELL:  Here you are with the Middle East just beginning to approach negotiations, and Israel announces an expansion of settlements. It was really a slap in the face to the visiting vice president."
168,"SEC'Y HILLARY CLINTON:  It was, Andrea.  And I've expressed that directly to the prime minister.  It was not just an unfortunate incident of timing, but the substance was, you know, something that is not needed as we are attempting to move toward the resumption of negotiations.  ...  It was insulting.  And it was insulting not just to the vice president, who
certainly didn't deserve that.  He was there with a very clear message of commitment to the peace process, solidarity with the Israeli people.  But it was an insult to the United States."
169,(End videotape)
170,"MR. BROKAW:  And that's Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  Today, in The New York Times, Tom Friedman, who really began his career or certainly commanded all of our attention by writing from the Middle East, has written this.  ""Biden should have snapped his notebook shut, gotten right back on Air Force Two, flown home and left the following scribbled note behind:  `Message from America to the Israeli government:  Friends don't let friends drive drunk.  And right now, you're driving drunk.  You think you can embarrass your only true ally in the world to satisfy some domestic political need with no consequences?  You have lost total contact with reality.  Call us when you're serious.  We need to focus on building our country.'"" Has it ever been more serious between the United States and Israel in recent years than this?"
171,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  No, this is a serious crisis, Tom.  But I, I put it in--first of all, I think the president, the vice president, secretary of State did exactly the right thing for American interests and for Israel, by, by the way. I think we got to put this in a, in a broad context, all
right?  I think what Hillary--Hillary's reaction and Biden's reaction, first of all, they were speaking for many secretaries of State, many presidents in the past who have had Israeli settlements shoved in their face before, during, and after a visit by Israel saying, ""Look, you guys do what you do, but we need to take care of our politics."" So there's a lot of backstory here, this isn't just about that trip."
172,"Second, I think we need to keep the following in mind.  What have we been--we, the United States--been doing for Israel rightly, I believe? We didn't, we didn't fight the Iraq war for Israel, but the fact is, in taking out Saddam Hussein, we took out a guy who had scud-missiled Israel and was giving $25,000 to any Palestinian who committed suicide against Israel.  We have fought against the--what I think was the tendentious Goldstone Report on, on the Gaza war on the world stage.  We've helped Israel protect it from that.  We've been trying to organize a global coalition against Iran.  And we give Israel, in the FY 2011 budget, $3 billion in military aid, the most advanced equipment. So let's put that context on."
173,"Then let's look at the moment we're in.  We have an Israeli prime minister from the right who actually could deliver the right.  He's done actually a lot of good things on the ground in the West Bank.  You have to give him credit for that.  We have the best Palestinian leadership
we've had in a long time. And we have a Sunni Arab world obsessed with Iran, ready to work with Israel more than ever.  You'd think in that context Israel could say to the United States, you know, ""You're doing all this for us, we're just going to stop settlements in Jerusalem, in
the West Bank, not temporarily, not moratorium. We're going to give you a chance to actually test the other side whether they're for real.  We've got enough settlements, we've go enough housing. Barack Obama, this Bud's for you.  We're going to do this for the American people."" Is that
anti-Semitism, is that anti-Israelism, to ask that of an Israeli government, to ask, act first in its own interest and then in America's interest?  I don't think so."
174,"MR. BROKAW:  Does that also have an impact on the relationship between the United States and the Iraqi government, which just had elections this past week, and in the face of renewed violence there, but they seem to have turned out pretty well.  So that Iraqi government has a strong alliance with the United States.  But can't the anti-United States elements in the Middle East say, ""You've just made a deal with the devil? Look what they're--what's going on in..."""
175,MR. FRIEDMAN:  You mean with the Israelis?
176,MR. BROKAW:  Yeah.
177,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yeah.  I mean, look, everyone in the Middle East is watching. You know, Tom, we both grew up in the Midwest.  You remember, we used to talk about the Minnesota State Fair."
178,MR. BROKAW:  Right.
179,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  I used to go the state fair as a kid.  There was a guy at the Minnesota State Fair who could guess your weight.  I was fascinated with that as a five, 10-year-old.  How does he get--and if he didn't get it right, you won a Kewpie doll or whatever.  In the Middle East, people can guess your power from a hundred paces.  They have to.  That's how,
how they survive.  And if we look weak, vis-a-vis our closest ally in the region, that will have regional implications."
180,"MR. BROKAW:  Let's talk about this country and what's going on here right now.  You said to me over the weekend that you're going to be spending more time looking at America because there's so much going on at this time.  Let's share with our audience what David had to say recently about the political climate.  ""In a sensible country, Obama would be able to
clearly define [his modern brand of moderate progressivism] without fear of offending the people he needs to get legislation passed.  But we don't live in that country.  We live in a country in which many people live in information cocoons in which they only talk to members of their own party and read blogs of their own sect."" Has the political culture been hijacked by the mechanics of the information technology?"
181,"MR. BROOKS:  Well, I do think everything--everybody gets to pick their own reality these days.  The--a lot of liberals think Obama's been very weak and he's not forceful enough.  I think he's been amazingly tenacious on Afghanistan, on health care, on education.  Pretty tough guy, I think. A lot of conservatives think he's a socialist, trying to turn us into
Sweden.  Give me a break; Is that what this health care is about?  But people like that because they want all differences to be 180 degrees rather than 30 degrees. And so they get to pick that reality because it makes them feel good."
182,"MR. BROKAW:  Tom, are we at a kind of turning point in America in terms of being able to make this a functioning country again or are we dysfunctional?"
183,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  Well, this is what worries me, that, you know, I've been saying for awhile, Tom, there's only one thing worse than a one-party autocracy, the Chinese form of government, and that's one-party democracy. You know, in China, if the leadership can get around to an enlightened decision, it can order it from the top down, OK?  Here, when
you have one-party democracy, one-party ruling, basically, and the other party just basically saying no, every solution is suboptimal, you know. And when your chief competitor in the world can order optimal and you can only produce suboptimal, because what happens, you know, whether it's health care or the energy bill, votes one through 50 cost you a lot, votes 50 to 59 cost you a fortune, and vote 60, his name's Ben Nelson. And by the time you've made all those compromises, you end up with the description David had of the healthcare bill, which is this Rube Goldberg contraption.  I really hope--I hope, personally, I hope it passes, I hope
it works, but I can't tell you I think it's optimal."
184,"MR. BROKAW:  If we can just--I've been wanting to share this on MEET THE PRESS for some time.  Looking forward beyond the elections this fall about the political future of President Obama, here are some numbers that people may want to keep in mind.  These are the unemployment rates in key states in 1982, well into President Reagan's first term.  Look at the
screen.  Michigan, 16.8 percent; Alabama, 14.3; Ohio, 13.9; down through 12 and above.  That went on into 1983.  Did it spell the end of the Reagan presidency?  Not exactly."
185,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  No, no.  You know, Tom, we were talking on the train yesterday, and it get--it gets to the point David was raising in his column. Why do I not travel abroad anymore?  Because this is the greatest show on Earth.  And it's not just a show.  It's that what happens here affects the whole world.  A lot of bad things happen in the world without us; not a lot of good things."
186,MR. BROOKS:  I got to get on this train ride.
187,"MR. BROKAW:  You're always welcome, David."
188,"Thank you very much, Tom Friedman, David Brooks.  Thanks very much for being with us.  We'll be right back."

TOM BROKAW:  A programming note:  Watch MSNBC today for my documentary called ""Operation Yellow Ribbon,"" the story of how the town of Gander in Newfoundland provided refuge and comfort for some 7,000 air travelers whose flights were diverted there right after 9/11.  We have had an astonishing reaction to this documentary, which first showed

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, decision time.  A special preview of the historic House vote on health care expected just hours from now.  Have the Democrats reached the magic number of 216 for passage after a personal visit from the president to House Democrats, Saturday?
    "
1,(Videotape)
2,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  It is in your hands.  It is time to pass healthcare reform for America, and I am confident that you are going to do it."
3,(End videotape)
4,"MR. GREGORY:  What will the final bill achieve?  With us exclusively, the leaders in the middle of the fight, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland and GOP leader John Boehner of Ohio."
5,"Then, what are the stakes for the Obama presidency and how large will health care loom in the fall campaign?  The political debate this morning between the party chairmen, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine vs. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele."
6,"Plus, insights and analysis on where the president goes from here with NBC News Chief White House Correspondent Chuck Todd; PBS's Tavis Smiley; former White House insider, Democrat Anita Dunn; and Republican Ed Gillespie."
7,"And in our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE, we remember Liz Carpenter, a pioneer in journalism, politics, and the women's rights movement who died yesterday at the age of 89.  Her feisty spirit was on display right here 33 years ago as she argued the case for the Equal Rights Amendment."
8,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  But first, down to the wire on healthcare reform. The House votes just hours from now.  President Obama made a last-minute trip to the Hill yesterday afternoon for the final push.  Joining us now, two men at the center of that fight, House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio and House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland."
9,"Both of you, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS on a big day. "
10,"REP. STENY HOYER (D-MD):  Good to be with you, David."
11,"MR. GREGORY:  Leader Hoyer, you need..."
12,REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH):  Nice to see you.
13,MR. GREGORY:  ...216 votes.  Where are you this morning?
14,REP. HOYER:  We're going to get those 216 votes because we believe that they understand that Americans want healthcare reform by overwhelming majorities.
15,MR. GREGORY:  Do you have them as we sit here?
16,"REP. HOYER:  I think we're going to have 216 votes when the roll is called, yes."
17,MR. GREGORY:  But not yet?  You're not nailed down.
18,REP. HOYER:  There's still member...
19,MR. GREGORY:  You--you're still a few behind.
20,REP. HOYER:  There's still members looking at it and trying to make up their minds.  But we think that there are going to be 216-plus votes when we call the roll.
21,MR. GREGORY:  What makes you so confident?  What's the final push?
22,"REP. HOYER:  Because for a hundred years, over a hundred years, David, as you well know, presidents of both parties have been saying we need to make sure that all Americans have access to affordable health care. George Bush said that, his father said that, Richard Nixon said it in 1974.  So that this is the time to do it.  We've come the furthest we've ever come to get--getting this done, and we're going to get it done today in the House of Representatives."
23,MR. GREGORY:  Fair to say there will not be a vote called if you don't have the 216?
24,REP. HOYER:  We're going to have a vote.  We're going to have 216.
25,MR. GREGORY:  Either way?
26,REP. HOYER:  We're going to pass this bill.
27,MR. GREGORY:  Either way you'll have a vote?
28,"REP. HOYER:  We're going, we're going to pass this bill, David."
29,"MR. GREGORY:  Leader Boehner, do they have the votes?"
30,"REP. BOEHNER:  Well, it's clear from listening to Steny that they don't have the votes yet.  You have to think about this.  Fifty-four speeches by the president of the United States over the last year, a year's conversation with the American people, and they've been heavily engaged in this conversation for nine months.  The Senate bill's been out there now for three months.  And yet, after all of this hand-wringing, all of this debate, millions of Americans upset on both sides of this debate, we're about to make this historic change on a purely partisan vote.  And I think if the American people stay engaged in this fight for the next few hours, that this, this fight is not lost yet. This fight for having real healthcare reform on a step-by-step basis to make our current system work better really can happen.  But first, we have to stop this bill, which will ruin our economy, ruin our healthcare system, the best healthcare system in the world."
31,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, you'll,"
32,"REP. HOYER:  David, let..."
33,"MR. GREGORY:  ...you'll be able to respond to some of the substance of that. But I thought Rex Babin in the Sacramento Bee, a cartoonist, summed up what the final push really looks like in this cartoon.  You have Speaker Pelosi, or the rough rider, trying to herd cats literally in the
Democratic caucus.  To Leader Boehner's point, why is this vote so close? Does it have something to do with the fact that, if you look at the opinion surveys, the public's against it?"
34,"REP. HOYER:  No, I don't think that's right.  The Economist poll shows that the majority of Americans are for it.  Kaiser shows that Americans are for it. Wall Street Journal poll that came out just a few days ago shows that..."
35,MR. GREGORY:  That's our poll.  That's not what it shows.  It shows...
36,"REP. HOYER:  Forty-six, 45."
37,"MR. GREGORY:  ...a majority want them to complete it, but the majority are opposed to it."
38,"REP. HOYER:  Well, I think if you look at every one of the internals, David, about stopping insurance companies from preventing pre-existing conditions from getting insurance, from putting so much money on--you have to spend per year that you go bankrupt and not putting on lifetime caps, those insurance reforms, those process reforms to insurance companies that are hurting Americans are all supported by overwhelming numbers of people."
39,"REP. BOEHNER:  Well, Steny, listen, there's no question..."
40,"REP. HOYER:  And people believe that we ought to have a, a national exchange so that the free market can be--operate so you can have transparency and competition."
41,"Let me also say about this vote, David.  You remember the prescription drug bill?  You remember that it took them three hours, from 3 AM in the morning to 6 AM in the morning, to bludgeon their members to get it to pass.  And it was very controversial.  And guess what, people like that prescription drug program and, in fact, we're going to make sure that the
failures of that program to, to make sure all Americans could afford it, we're going to close the doughnut hole for seniors.  So I think that Americans are for this bill. What they don't like is the divisiveness, the confrontation and, very frankly, the misrepresentation."
42,"REP. BOEHNER:  Oh, no.  David, David, there are insurance reforms and healthcare reforms that we can agree upon.  We talked about it at the White House during the summer.  But the--what the American people don't want is this big government takeover of our healthcare system--160 new boards, commissions, mandates, $500 billion in tax increases on an economy that, that is supposed to be producing jobs, and $500 billion being stolen from Medicare in order to fund a new government entitlement program.  They want no part of this."
43,REP. HOYER:  Government takeover...
44,"MR. GREGORY:  Let, let me, let me interject a question."
45,"REP. HOYER:  ...and stolen--John, you know that is not true.  It--this is not a government takeover, it's a creation of open markets with private insurance companies offering insurance to people who don't have it. "
46,"REP. BOEHNER:  It, it is a government takeover..."
47,REP. HOYER:  It's not a government takeover.
48,"REP. BOEHNER:  ...and, and a mandate on every American to have health insurance, a mandate on every employer to provide health insurance.  How about the health choices czar..."
49,REP. HOYER:  But that's not accurate.
50,REP. BOEHNER:  ...that's going to decide what every health insurance policy in America looks like within five years.
51,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me interject a question about the tone of this debate. This was the scene on Capitol Hill yesterday where you had tea party activists protesting the vote.  And in some cases it got quite ugly, where we had instances of anti-gay epithets being hurled at  Congressman Frank, racist epithets, as well, hurled by protesters.  Are you concerned, Leader Boehner, that the Republican Party is in any way associated with tea party activists who are among these protesters?"
52,"REP. BOEHNER:  Well, listen.  There were some isolated incidents on the Hill yesterday that were reprehensible and should not have happened.  But let's not let a few isolated incidents get in the way of the fact that millions of Americans are scared to death and millions of Americans want no part of this growing size of government here in Washington.  We've got
the best healthcare system in the world, and we're about to take this dangerous step, very dangerous step toward the government running the whole thing.  That's not what the American people want. "
53,"MR. GREGORY:  We--we've heard this debate over weeks and months, and we're not going to solve that now about--this is very much a question about the role of government in a, in a, in a system like health care. But I want to ask, first of all, Leader Hoyer, a comment on some of the, the protests that you saw yesterday and the tone of the debate at the end."
54,"REP. HOYER:  I think the tone of this entire debate has been denigrated, has been brought down, frankly, by the rhetoric of ""government takeover,"" ""socialism,"" things that are simply not accurate or true.  But it has put people in fear.  And when they're fear--fearful and angry, they don't look at the substance.  But when you ask them questions about the substance of these bills, which is the point I made earlier, David, they say yes, that makes sense.  Yes, that's common sense.  Yes, that makes sense.  Whether it's the insurance reforms, the affordability.  This is the biggest deficit reduction bill that we're going to have the
opportunity to vote on in a very long period of time."
55,"And very frankly, John Boehner said in 1993 that if we adopted President Clinton's economic program, the economy was going to go downhill very, very quickly, unemployment would rocket up and the deficits would explode.  Exactly the opposite happened."
56,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we, we have..."
57,REP. HOYER:  Best economy we've had in my lifetime.
58,REP. BOEHNER:  This will bankrupt our country.
59,"MR. GREGORY:  This debate will play out.  But, Leader Hoyer..."
60,REP. HOYER:  This time he says he's right.
61,MR. GREGORY:  ...I want to get to a couple of substantive points.
62,REP. HOYER:  Yeah.
63,"MR. GREGORY:  Very briefly, three top things that Americans will feel from healthcare reform this year."
64,"REP. HOYER:  Availability of insurance, availability for small businesses. For seniors, the doughnut hole's going to be closed.  People who have children who are up to 25 or 26 years of age will have access to be on their insurance policies.  Immediate reduction in prices for small
business.  They're going  to have group--availability of group policies. And tax credits for small businesses and individuals to get insurance. "
65,MR. GREGORY:  But the 32 million additional don't really start to get covered till 2014.
66,"REP. HOYER:  No.  We'll--we'll phase them in.  That's accurate, David. And we're going to phase them in, because this is a very large, complex program. And we're going to have to..."
67,"REP. BOEHNER:  But, David, you're right.  Most of this doesn't go into effect for four years."
68,"REP. HOYER:  Well, he's correct."
69,REP. BOEHNER:  Except the tax increases and the Medicare cuts go into effect immediately.
70,"REP. HOYER:  No, no."
71,"REP. BOEHNER:  So we've got 10 years of, of Medicare cuts, 10 years of tax increases to pay for six years of, of this new program.  And while the..."
72,"REP. HOYER:  John, you're making a point..."
73,REP. BOEHNER:  ...my friend says...
74,REP. HOYER:  ...but we save over $1 trillion over the next 20 years.
75,"REP. BOEHNER:  ...that we're, that we're, that we're going to save, we're going to save money from this is just not true.  The $300..."
76,"MR. GREGORY:  And, in fact, and in fact..."
77,"REP. BOEHNER:  ...billion of--to fix the doctor reimbursement problem is
not in the bill."
78,"REP. HOYER:  And what's in, and what's in your bill, John?"
79,"REP. BOEHNER:  And everybody knows, and everybody knows that, that it's going to need to be dealt with."
80,"REP. HOYER:  Why didn't you put it in your bill, John?"
81,"REP. BOEHNER:  They take, they take $70 billion out of the Class Act, this is the new long-term care insurance program, and they use it to pay for current benefits.  And the $500 billion they take out of Medicare--they're stealing from Medicare to start a new entitlement program, and if there's savings from Medicare, why wouldn't we roll it back in to save Medicare and, and to prolong the trust fund that's there to fund it?"
82,"MR. GREGORY:  Leader Boehner, there's a question of the cost of inaction, and Ron Brownstein writes about it in his National Journal column.  I want to put it up on the screen and have you react to it.  ""In all,"" he writes, ""CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, has projected that the
Senate bill would raise enough revenue and sufficiently cut existing spending to both cover its costs and reduce the federal deficit in the near and long term.  For fiscal hawks, that's a powerful"" incentative ""for action""--incentive, rather.  ""But equally compelling could be the
price of inaction.  If Obama's plan fails, as President Clinton's did, it's likely that no president would attempt a seriously expand coverage for many years.  The independent Medicare actuary has projected that under current trends the number of uninsured will increase by 10 million, to about 57 million, by 2019.  Providing uncompensated care to so many uninsured people would further strain physicians and hospitals - and inflate premiums as those providers shift costs to their insured patients."""
83,"Why, based on that, would you not conclude that even a flawed bill, as you might see it, is still better than nothing? "
84,"REP. BOEHNER:  I don't disagree with what Ron wrote there, and there's nobody in talk--in Washington talking about inaction.  We've laid out commonsense steps that will lower the cost of health insurance according to the Congressional Budget Office by up to 10 percent, and this
step-by-step approach preserves the greatest healthcare system in the world.  It doesn't take this dangerous step toward, toward government-run health insurance.  And so we can take steps, and we need to take steps, but we need to do it together.  Never in the history of our country have we made such a big, momentous decision on a straight party-line vote."
85,"REP. HOYER:  Well, we made a very big momentous decision in 1993, as I pointed out on a partisan line, no Republicans voted for it.  We had the best economy result in our lifetimes.  However, having said that, the dangerous takeovers, this language, really distracts us from the debate on the substance.  Harry and Louise said in 1994, ""You're going to pay more and get less if we do something."" We did nothing and guess what happened?  They paid more and they got less."
86,MR. GREGORY:  But in terms...
87,"REP. HOYER:  This is--he's absolutely right when he makes that quote. This is an opportunity both to save money in the short term and in the long term. And, unlike your program, which included three million people, this includes 32 million people..."
88,"MR. GREGORY:  But the reality is, this assumes the Congress..."
89,REP. HOYER:  ...to access.
90,MR. GREGORY:  ...will do what it says it will do going forward.
91,"REP. HOYER:  Yes, it does."
92,"MR. GREGORY:  And you know there is indeed the chance that some of the financing, raising taxes down the line, which won't happen until 2018, may not actually come to pass.  So you can't take these CBO numbers to the bank, can you?"
93,"REP. HOYER:  David, you're correct on that, and Congress is going to have to show courage, and the American people are going to have to show judgment as we go forward whatever we do.  You're absolutely right on that.  As somebody who believes that the fiscal posture confronting our country is one of the most serious that we have, and we need to get back
to fiscal discipline and fiscal balance.  And the surpluses that we had during the Clinton administration, you're absolutely right on that. We're going to have to show courage and do what we say we're going to do."
94,"MR. GREGORY:  Leader Boehner, this is what you said about the politics of this decision for the November race.  This is what you said the other day."
95,"(Videotape, Friday)"
96,"REP. BOEHNER:  The American people do not want any part of this, and if anyone thinks the American people are going to forget this vote, just watch."
97,(End videotape)
98,MR. GREGORY:  That to me--I may be wrong about this--that does sound like a threat.  Are Democrats going to lose the House in the fall because of this vote?
99,"REP. BOEHNER:  I don't know whether they will or not.  Our goal is to gain the majority.  It's a steep climb, but we want the majority not for the sake of having the majority.  We want the majority so that we can renew our fight for a smaller, less costly, and more accountable
government."
100,"MR. GREGORY:  But the campaign in the fall will be about, for Republicans, will be about repealing health care?"
101,"REP. BOEHNER:  If, if this bill passes, we will have an effort to repeal the bill, and we'll do it the same way that we approached health care, on a step-by-step basis.  I'd have a bill on the floor the first thing out to eliminate the Medicare cuts, eliminate the tax increases, eliminate
the mandate that every American has to buy health insurance and the employer mandate..."
102,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  And, and..."
103,REP. BOEHNER:  ...that's going to kill jobs.
104,"MR. GREGORY:  And Republicans, they would cover far fewer people.  I mean, that's the vision that Republicans..."
105,REP. HOYER:  Would you eliminate...
106,"MR. GREGORY:  Leader Hoyer, wait a minute.  Before..."
107,"REP. BOEHNER:  Their plan will bankrupt our country, David!"
108,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
109,REP. HOYER:  That's not what the CBO says.
110,"MR. GREGORY:  Leader Hoyer, the impact on 2010?  Does this cost Democrats
the House?"
111,"REP. HOYER:  No.  I think we're going to win the House back.  I think the American public saw the Republican leadership for 12 years, and they decided they didn't like that in '06, and they decided they didn't like the Republican presidency either in '08.  And so they changed course, and they asked us to do strong things.  And John McCain in that campaign said, ""What do we need?  We need to have Americans have access to affordable health care."" All Americans. That's what John McCain said in the debate in '08."
112,REP. BOEHNER:  And I agree with him.
113,"REP. HOYER:  Obama said the same thing, and that's what we're doing."
114,"MR. GREGORY:  We are--we are out of time.  Leader Hoyer, how many votes shy are you as you sit here?"
115,REP. HOYER:  We're going to get the votes.
116,MR. GREGORY:  Low single digits?
117,"REP. HOYER:  We're going to get the votes.  Low single digits, certainly, but we're going to get the votes, and we're going to have those votes this afternoon."
118,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, trying to pin you down.  Thank you both very much."
119,REP. HOYER:  Good try.
120,"MR. GREGORY:  Up next, what are the stakes of this healthcare legislation for the Obama presidency, and how large will this issue loom in the fall campaign? An exclusive debate, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine vs. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele.  Plus, insights and analysis on it all from our roundtable.  Chuck Todd, Tavis Smiley, Anita Dunn, and Ed Gillespie, only here on MEET THE PRESS."
121,(Announcements)
122,MR. GREGORY:  Democratic Party Chairman Tim Kaine and Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele square off in an exclusive debate after this brief commercial break.
123,(Announcements)
124,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We're back, joined now by Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine and Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele. Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS."
125,"All right, we just heard from the leaders about all of the runs, hits and errors on Capitol Hill today.  Let me ask a slightly larger question, Chairman Steele.  If this is victory for the president on health care, at what cost did he achieve it."
126,"MR. MICHAEL STEELE:  I think his defeat in the fall, in November.  I think you cannot ignore the past year of voters out there at town halls, in tea parties, in gatherings around the country, talking and conversing with their congressmen and elected officials directly, and then not
having that listened to, having a deaf ear turned to them by the administration, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid.  And I think the ballot box will be the last voice in this, in this big campaign for health care because the voters have made it very clear in poll after poll.  They do not want what's presently being proposed, they want to take a slower step approach.  They want the reforms, but they want it in a way that really address the costs.  You're going to add 33 million people to the healthcare rolls.  How do you effectively pay for it?  And the way this is set up, those folks don't hit the rolls until 2014 and later, which  then jumps the cost of this to over $2 trillion."
127,"MR. GREGORY:  But you wrote a, you wrote a letter this week to, to supporters of the RNC."
128,MR. STEELE:  Mm-hmm.
129,"MR. GREGORY:  And you say this, ""After a year a pushing his radical socialist health care `reform' experiment, Obama has just a few more days to wait to see"" if ""his number one priority succeeded.  ... If Pelosi can successfully cajole, intimidate, coerce her Democrat majority into
approving a bill the American people are against by a 3:1 margin, Obama and the rest of the radical Democrats in Washington will see their dream of government-run, government-rationed health care come true."" And, you know, critics of, of that kind of appeal with that sort of heavy rhetoric say this is a healthcare package that is more moderate than President Nixon actually put forward."
130,"MR. STEELE:  Well, not the way the American people see it.  You're taking one-sixth of the economy, and you're basically turning it on a head--on its head where you've got more government controls put in place, more commissions, more regulatory processes that are put in place, $406 billion in new taxes, $507 billion in cuts to Medicare.  You've got this,
this 94--900--nine--what, $940 billion CBO number, which even they say, ""Well, it's not the real number because there are other features of this that when they kick in will jump the cost over $2 trillion."" So this is the, this is the predicate that has been laid for the healthcare
debate that concerns people.  I think that rhetoric is reflective of how people feel and, and the concern that they have.  And I think it's important for the administration and the leadership on the hill to understand that."
131,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor, at what cost will victory be achieved?"
132,"FMR. GOV. TIM KAINE (D-VA):  David, this is going to be great for Democrats. You know, I've been on a ballot seven times and won seven races.  I would love to be running on this.  And I think the extreme nature of the rhetoric just shows how worried the other guys are.  Here's
what's going to happen.  This bill passes, right away seniors get a break on purchasing prescription medications.  Right away small businesses get a tax credit so they can afford to purchase insurance for their employees.  Right away parents will be able to keep kids on their
policies till they're 26 instead of 21.  And right away we stop the most heartless abuses of insurance companies kicking sick people around. That's going to happen right away.  The American public will see it. They won't see death panels, they won't see a government bureaucrat telling you to switch doctors, they won't see any of the phantoms that the other
guy's created.  And so if the--if going forward into 2010, if they want to campaign, as the leader said a minute ago, Leader Boehner, on repeal, let them do that just like Alf Landon campaigned to repeal Social Security in 1936.  This is going to be a big win for the American public, and every Democrat everywhere will get a tailwind because"
133,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Governor Kaine, you, you..."
134,GOV. KAINE:  ...they will have solved the big issue and done it well.
135,"MR. GREGORY:  You and the White House, certainly, Democrats, make the argument, `Let's pass this thing and you'll see the popularity increase.' Former President Clinton has said the same thing because people will like the individual elements of the bill, they're going to come around to this, even though a majority oppose the president's version of healthcare reform now. And yet, if you look at how the stimulus has fared, oh, those many months ago that it was passed, here's our latest poll that shows views about the stimulus package passed by the administration.  Forty-two percent think it's still a bad idea as opposed to 35 percent think it's a good idea.  What makes you so sure that people are going to come around on health care?"
136,"GOV. KAINE:  Well, well, look, David, here's the deal.  Before the stimulus was passed, the economy, as you know, was shrinking at 6 percent a year.  It's now growing at 6 percent a year.  Before the stimulus was passed, the American economy was losing 750,000 jobs a month.  Now we've got it back to net even. This is not primarily about politics, it's primarily about solving an issue that presidents since Teddy Roosevelt have tried to solve."
137,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, that's a fair point.  But I'm asking you a political question, and it's not always about merits in politics."
138,GOV. KAINE:  But--OK.  Then let me get to politics.  Then let me get to the politics.
139,MR. GREGORY:  People don't feel the stimulus.
140,"GOV. KAINE:  What, what they see about the healthcare bill is if--there are some polls, and you've cited them, that, overall, people have concerns.  Now, there were some polls this week that showed a majority are in favor.  In fact, in the last six weeks, there's been about a 13
point move in favor of healthcare reform.  But the thing that's important to know, and I know, I know you know this from your guys' own poll, if you poll about the individual elements, ""What do you think about reforming insurance so that they can't kick people off when they get sick
or turn them down when they change jobs or because of pre-existing condition,"" the American public says thumbs up.  ""What do you think about tax credits for small businesses?"" Thumbs up.  ""What do you think about parents having kids on their policy?"" Thumbs up."
141,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah, but you're repeating the point.  What I'm trying to make--say is that, that the package deal on the stimulus has not borne fruit, and what makes you so sure that it's going to bear fruit on... "
142,"GOV. KAINE:  But it has borne fruit.  The, the economy is now starting to go the right direction again.  It was in a free fall, and the other guys wouldn't even pull the rip cord."
143,"MR. STEELE:  But you're not, but you're not creating jobs, Governor. You're not--that's the core of this, this debate, really, is not so much about health care..."
144,GOV. KAINE:  CBO says we are creating jobs.
145,"MR. STEELE:  ...it's more about--well, tell that to the person who just got a pink slip yesterday."
146,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
147,GOV. KAINE:  Well...
148,"MR. STEELE:  Because the reality of it is that people are still being  aid off, jobs are not being created, and now you're about to take one-sixth of the nation's economy and turn it on its head at a time when you can ill afford to do that.  And the legacy here--this is the key thing that we need to focus on--if we don't get this right now--and I think we're both in agreement that we need to get this right--but if we don't get it right, future generations are--will not forgive us for passing on the debt and deficits that will come as a result of spending money we do not have today."
149,"GOV. KAINE:  Well, David..."
150,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let, let, let me, let me ask..."
151,GOV. KAINE:  Yeah.
152,"MR. GREGORY:  ...the other political kind of corollary to this.  Here's a poll about Congress, which we'll prepare, shows how people feel.  The question was, ""Would you vote to defeat and replace every single member of Congress, including your own representative?"" Fifty percent say yes. So in that case, Chairman Steele, how, how do you frame the debate about health care in the fall?  Is it about repeal?"
153,"MR. STEELE:  It--absolutely it's about repealing.  You know who's framing the debate this fall?  The people are.  That's the beauty of what's happening right now.  You've seen this surge across the spectrum--right, left, center--people expressing what they want.  The problem has been from the very beginning of this debate, David, that the leadership has not listened.  This administration, this Congress has not listened to what people wanted.  They've gotten on their cell phones in the middle of town hall meetings, they've asked for IDs.  Here in northern Virginia, at--in town hall meetings, you know, before you speak, you've got to let me know if you're in my district.  People have an expression they want to make on this, on this healthcare debate, on the economy, and the administration and the Congress hasn't let them do it. So, yes, this is very much about those things."
154,MR. GREGORY:  Before you respond to the poll...
155,GOV. KAINE:  Yeah.
156,"MR. GREGORY:  ...what about the tone of the debate?  I asked the leaders about this.  Some of the racial epithets, anti-gay epithets among tea party activists.  Is there a danger for Republicans to be associated with the tea party movement?"
157,"MR. STEELE:  Well, we're not associate--well, we're not--no, it's not a danger to be associated with the tea party movement.  It is--it's certainly not a reflection of the movement or the Republican Party when you have some idiots out there saying very stupid things.  So, as, as the leader said, as Leader Boehner said, that's reprehensible, we do not support that.  You can have this debate without, without attacking a member of Congress personally."
158,"MR. GREGORY:  But do you think some of your own rhetoric in the RNC, that slide show you had from your finance director vilifying the speaker and the president, talking about socialist health care.  Do you think... "
159,"MR. STEELE:  Inappropriate, as I said, inappropriate, and it should not
have happened.  And we've dealt..."
160,MR. GREGORY:  But what about your own fundraising letter?  Does that kind of rhetoric spur activism that gets to a point of ugliness?
161,"MR. STEELE:  Well, there's a fine line between engaging your donors and your activists to get them fired up and go out, going out and, and do for you, to raise money, etc., and saying something, as we've heard yesterday, that are racial epithets and anti-gay language.  There's a very--there's a very bright line there for us to not cross.  And nothing we've done or said on either side, Democrat or Republican, in the hot rhetoric of this, you know, I think comes to that.  What you had out there yesterday were a handful of people who just got stupid and, and said very ignorant things.  And neither party, I believe, are associated--or should be associated with that. "
162,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor Kaine, let me get you back to the framing the fall."
163,GOV. KAINE:  Right.
164,"MR. GREGORY:  You've got stubborn joblessness, a high unemployment rate. How do Democrats use this healthcare vote to campaign in the fall?"
165,"GOV. KAINE:  Sure.  We're the solutions party, David.  That's the way we use it.  I think the overheated rhetoric is one of the reasons why people, when they're asked about Congress, say things like, ""Well, we should replace it,"" because they want to see not rhetoric but results.
And so what we've seen with the Democrats over the last year and a half is the economy was in a free fall, and the previous administration wouldn't even pull the rip cord to, you know, pull out the parachute. This president has done the heavy lifting to get the economy growing again.  He's done the heavy lifting to stop the job losses, and we're doing the heavy lifting to do something that presidents since Teddy Roosevelt have tried, which is provide security to the Americans with insurance and a path to coverage to those who don't have it.  And
finally, as the CBO said, tackling the unsustainable growth in healthcare costs.  That's what this bill does.  I think the American public will always reward problem solvers over the folks who just, you know, throw rhetorical arguments and red meat to their base."
166,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, let..."
167,GOV. KAINE:  And we're solving problems.  And that's how we win in November.
168,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me conclude with this.  I want to put something on the screen that Ron Brownstein also--National Journal wrote about what we've learned about the president's leadership approach to issues like this. And this is what he wrote:  ""The [health care] fight has opened a second window into Obama.  The key here is the '08 campaign assertion that
`Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America' more than Richard Nixon or Bill Clinton did.  The ...  struggle suggests that Obama views changing that trajectory as the ultimate measure of a presidency's success.  His aim is to establish a long-term political direction - one
centered on a more activist government.  ...  Everything else - the legislative tactics, even most individual policies - is negotiable.  He wants to chart the course for the supertanker, not to steer it around each wave or decide which crates are loaded into its hull."""
169,"From each of you, what have we learned about the president's approach to his job, to his presidency?"
170,"MR. STEELE:  I think he hit it right on the head.  He--this is a president who believes fundamentally in an activist government, not an activist business class, not an activist community of investors and, and those who will create the wealth in an economy.  He sees that being centered--coming out of the federal government, using the institutions and the apparati of, of federal government to achieve those ends.  That is not what this country was founded on.  It is--fundamentally goes against every economic approach that we've had. Whether you like capitalism or not, it has provided for the wealth that's been created in
this nation.  It has not been created by government.  And that, for me, is a fundamental difference between a Ronald Reagan and a Barack Obama. "
171,MR. GREGORY:  What have we learned?
172,"GOV. KAINE:  David, what I'll say is what we've learned is that the president is good to his campaign promise.  He campaigned on the status quo is not working for the American public.  The, the decade of the--you know, the first decade of this century people lost income, we were losing jobs, the stock market was tanking, lax regulation led to meltdowns in the financial industry. And the president campaigned saying we've got to change direction if we're going to serve our people and be competitive in a global economy.  And that's why we see the heavy lifting to get the economy going again, to find a better energy future, to reform education,
and, yes, to do what so many presidents have tried to do, solve Americans' pressing health problems."
173,"I met a firefighter this week who has got, a daughter's about ready to graduate from college who's got a, you know, congenital illness and said she's going to go off his policy and what can he do?  When a bill like this passes and parents can keep kids on their policy till they're 26 or
seniors get a break, we'll be solving problems.  That's what this president was elected to do."
174,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you think that, either of you, that you'll be back here on this program discussing grand consensus between Republicans and Democrats in the course of this administration on another issue?"
175,MR. STEELE:  I hope so.
176,"GOV. KAINE:  I do.  I do, yeah."
177,"MR. STEELE:  I--yeah, I hope so.  I really do, because the country can't take what we've just spent the last year doing.  We cannot, we cannot approach the big issues that we face the way we have.  You cannot claim bipartisanship but then not invite the Republican leadership to the table or even to be in the room.  You cannot..."
178,"MR. GREGORY:  That, of course, would be disputed."
179,"GOV. KAINE:  And, David, and here--I mean, here's a good sign.  Senator Schumer and Senator Graham had an article that came out just two days ago talking about the fact that there can be bipartisan agreement on comprehensive immigration reform.  And I think there are a whole series of issues where there can be.  I wish that there had been some Republicans who would get on board with the healthcare bill that, frankly, owes an awful lot to their ideas.  They're going to miss this opportunity, but there are going to be other opportunities."
180,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, to be continued.  Thank you both very much."
181,MR. STEELE:  All right.
182,"MR. GREGORY:  Up next, where does President Obama go from here?  Plus, the very latest on the American public's attitude toward the president and Congress from our Wall Street Journal poll with NBC.  Our roundtable weighs in:  NBC News chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd; PBS's Tavis Smiley; former White House insiders, Democrat Anita Dunn and Republican Ed Gillespie. It's all after this brief station break."
183,(Announcements)
184,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We're back with our roundtable:  former White House advisers, two insiders, Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Anita Dunn; Chuck Todd of NBC News, our chief White House correspondent and political director; as well as Tavis Smiley of PBS."
185,"Welcome to all of you.  Let's get right into it.  Here was the president on Friday, the, the ""close the sale"" rally that he had.  And he had some interesting things to say.  Listen to this."
186,"(Videotape, Friday)"
187,"PRES. OBAMA:  I don't know how passing health care will play politically, but I know it's right.  Ted--Teddy Roosevelt knew it was right.  Harry Truman knew when it was right.  Ted Kennedy knew it was right.  And if you believe that it's right, then you've got to help us finish this
fight."
188,(End videotape)
189,"MR. GREGORY:  He, he mentioned some former presidents and, of course, Ted Kennedy, all of whom couldn't get health care done.  If, indeed, it proves that he does get it done, is this his crowning achievement?  Is this what puts him in the history books, Anita?"
190,"MS. ANITA DUNN:  You know, David, I would think that given the fact that he's got another two and a half years of his administration, there would be other achievements as well.  But there's no question this would be a huge thing for the American people, for this Congress, and for this presidency to show that you really can still deal with big issues in this town, which is something many people have thought just wasn't possible. And the political courage of taking on a very complex, very difficult issue that Republican and Democratic presidents have tried to deal with for over a century now, is something that I think would be a significant achievement.  But the winners?  The American people who don't have to worry about insurance."
191,"MR. GREGORY:  Ed Gillespie, you've been here in--inside the White House, dealing with very tough, controversial, big issues under President Bush. What does this mean for President Obama?  Do you see it differently? "
192,"MR. ED GILLESPIE:  No.  Look, if he gets this done, it is historic.  I think it's historically bad and that there will be a real price to pay for it in November.  But there's no doubt, I mean, the way they have pushed this bill through is going to have a long-term effect, not only on our health care and our economy, but also on the future of Washington.  And for someone who ran as a post-partisan, this has been a very partisan process.  And 10 years from now when there's a discussion on the roundtable about why is the Senate now just like the House in terms of
the civil discourse and the lack of bipartisanship and the, you know, the polarizing nature of it, we'll look back and say, ""Well, remember in--when they did health care, they got rid of the 60-vote margin and now the Senate lives by a simple majority rule,"" and that's going to have
long-term impact as well.  It's negative."
193,"MR. GREGORY:  Chuck Todd, you study our polling, you're involved with our polling, of course.  I think it's fair to say, left, right and center, the American people expected more from Washington on this."
194,"MR. CHUCK TODD:  They did.  I mean, clearly this issue of polarization is something that is frustrating, particularly the middle.  And one thing I think we forget, though, is on the issue of health care is that this actually gets at the philosophical divide between Democrats and
Republicans.  I've asked many a Republican and many a Democrat on this issue, is health care coverage a right or a privilege?  And that divide in it, it is a philosophical divide. So, on this issue, it shouldn't be surprising that we're sitting here so polarized.  It's sort of the
fundamental reason why somebody's a Democrat, believing in a more activist government, or somebody's a Republican, believing in keeping government smaller.  It's so--sometimes I--you know, when I was hearing the two party chairmen saying, ""Well, maybe on immigration, maybe on energy they can come""--well, that's because they, actually, are regional differences, this isn't a philosophical divide.  This is truly one of the great philosophical divides of American politics."
195,"MR. GREGORY:  Tavis, when you, when you strip away all the process, which will melt away over time, and even, even some of the rancorous feelings about all that, you'll be left with whether this makes people better off or not."
196,"MR. TAVIS SMILEY:  I think the president deserves great respect for having the courage to take this issue on.  Seven presidents have tired heretofore, and they've all failed.  So I think he gets credit for taking it on.  There's some good stuff in this bill; there's some bad stuff in
this bill.  I think we have another four years of a death sentence, quite frankly, for people who do have pre-existing conditions who aren't going to be covered for four years. It takes too long to phase this thing in. I think, additionally, that it's not just the American people who might
win today, if this vote can pass--30, 31, 32 million more Americans are covered.  That's a good thing.  But it's also true that the insurance people are the real winners here.  There is so much more that this bill should have been, to your question to Chuck a moment ago.  Americans expected more.  The insurance companies really won here."
197,"When I was last around this table, that week the stock of the insurance companies hit a 52-year high.  They are happy about this vote today given what it could have been.  And so I think that, you know, there's a lot to be done here.  Speaker Gingrich, former Speaker Gingrich, yesterday suggested that Democrats should pass this, and that it's good if they pass it because it's going to hurt them the way that the Democrats were hurt after LBJ crushed--pushed through civil rights legislation.  If that--first of all, it's a bad analogy to the speaker, number one.  But secondly, there are some things that are just right, and if you're going 
to lose, go down swinging.  And I think this is an issue that's serious for all Americans."
198,"MS. DUNN:  Well, I do have to respond to that, David, because if it's so good for the insurance companies, Tavis, why have they spent $200 million trying to defeat this?  Why has there been such a pitched battle from that particular interest group and from those groups?  I mean the reality of this is, for all the Republicans have talked about how it's a government takeover, this is very similar, as Chairman Kaine said, to, you know, a--the Republican approach from 1993.  What it says to the American people, David, is that it--Washington has changed, that they're
ready to stand up to one of the most powerful groups of interests, the insurance companies, that they're ready to stand up to the forces of fear that have kept people from dealing with this issue for so long, and that the reality is that, as of next week at this time, you're going to be talking about the fact that college students can stay on their parents policies after they graduate in May and June this year until they're 26, that they won't be without insurance.  You're going to be talking about the fact that children who have pre-existing conditions can  get insurance, which they cannot do right now.  You're going to be talking about small businesses getting tax credits to cover their employees. You're going to be talking about very different things that are all huge benefits."
199,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, well, we'll--and I want to get some of the..."
200,MS. DUNN:  Yeah.
201,MR. GREGORY:  ...how the politics lays out.
202,MS. DUNN:  Yeah.
203,"MR. GREGORY:  But let's, let's talk--this question, Chuck, of at what cost is victory achieved.  What are the leadership lessons of this healthcare fight for the administration?"
204,"MR. TODD:  Well, I think they're going to, at this point, look at a couple of things.  Number one, the mistake of letting Congress write this thing.  The mistake of just putting it all on them and it was sort of overlearning--you know, I think every presidency does this, they overlearn the conventional wisdom, mistakes of the previous presidency. And in this one, the overlearned lesson here with, ""Well, we didn't work--Bill Clinton didn't work with Congress close enough.  Didn't, didn't do these things."" And so they let it happen, and let it--they let too many odd issues bubble up and sort of over, overtake some of the bigger, the bigger issues.  And then you look at the bipartisanship.  I mean, the fact is they had Olympia--the White House had Olympia Snowe, and they wouldn't even have been worrying about Scott Brown, they probably would have had this thing passed two months ago.  And Harry Reid lost Olympia Snowe.  And when they lost even the one or two Republicans that they could have gotten, it set up the situation that they're facing today."
205,"MR. GREGORY:  And Ed, as we brought up with the party chairman, they are still counting on a strategy where they hope support increases--and White House advisers say they believe this--that there actually will be increased support once it gets passed, once it gets past a point of
mischaracterization."
206,MR. GILLESPIE:  Yeah.  Yeah.
207,MR. GREGORY:  But then you look at the stimulus example...
208,MR. GILLESPIE:  Right.
209,MR. GREGORY:  ...where that still hasn't come to pass yet.
210,"MR. GILLESPIE:  A couple of points.  One, they've clearly made the, the determination politically that they are more damned if they don't than damned if they do.  I disagree with that.  I think passing this bill is going to result not only in a Republican takeover of the House in November, I think we could possibly take over the Senate at this point, which I have not said before and not felt before.  But if they jam this through the Senate and through the House, I think we can.  There's going to be a lot of blood on the floor at the end of the day, and it's not going to be Republican blood."
211,"Second, I'm not sure it's, it's actually--we're talking here as though it's a done deal and that it's going to pass.  And my head says that's the case because, if the speaker of the House brings a bill to the floor, generally it passes."
212,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
213,"MR. GILLESPIE:  But my gut tells me it may not be.  I mean, I think we could be in for a very long day, and it's not--it would not surprise me, at the end of the day, if this bill collapses."
214,"MR. GREGORY:  Anita, to that point, do..."
215,MR. TODD:  Kansas was supposed to beat Northern Iowa.
216,"MR. GILLESPIE:  Exactly, yeah.  The speaker's always the number one seed."
217,"MR. GREGORY:  Inside the White House, do they think this is done?"
218,"MS. DUNN:  Inside the White House, they believe that by the end of the day we will see a vote in the House..."
219,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
220,MS. DUNN:  ...that will pass this bill.
221,"MR. GREGORY:  Which is pretty dynamic for a Sunday, the fact they will..."
222,"MS. DUNN:  Well, I was going to say that's not the typical Sunday conversation."
223,"MR. GREGORY:  So a lot could happen, yeah.  Not a typical Sunday.  A lot can happen."
224,MS. DUNN:  Yeah.
225,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's play a little bit of politics here, OK?  Another president says he doesn't know how it plays politically, and that we're sort of obsessed with that here."
226,"MS. DUNN:  Fortunately, he's got people like us for him.  So..."
227,"MR. GREGORY:  Yes, exactly right.  And he doesn't face the voters.  Let's look, everybody around the table, at a couple of voters--a couple of congressman who are voting; one no, one yes.  Here's Representative Jason Altmire.  He's from western Pennsylvania.  He'll be voting no.  He has cited a lot of constituents as being overwhelmingly opposed to this.  He faced some steelworkers who staged a sit-in in his office just yesterday urging him to do the right thing and vote for the bill.  He is from a very tough district that McCain carried 55-44 in 2006."
228,"Now on the other side you have John Boccieri.  He is voting yes now after voting no in November.  He's a Democrat.  He was just elected in '08. Another tight district, 50 percent McCain to Obama, 48, just in 2008.  He says now something is better than nothing."
229,"Chuck, what are the consequences for each of these congressmen as they go into the fall?"
230,"MR. TODD:  I'll say this.  I do think that we're--we--to assume that the next six months is going to look like it looks today is, is clearly--to say that is clearly you haven't watched American politics over the last three cycles.  To sustain this anger and this, and this ability to rally conservatives, rally independents against Democrats in some of these swing districts I think is going to be tricky.  That said, you know, look, there are some guys who have--who basically made the decision ""Well, it is easier to go down.  At least the base of the Democratic
Party will be with me in the fall and, you know, this is going to be a base turnout election, so don't depress the base."" I mean, that was sort of the political argument that they were saying.  But I'll tell you, look, with the middle, you know, if they don't see what they're
getting--and see that's  I think going to be the tricky thing.  Selling this thing in six months.  People aren't going to see the fact... "
231,"MR. SMILEY:  I respect Chuck's analysis, and I think he's right about this, but here's, here's the problem--and I'm not naive when I say this and know that I'm sitting in Washington this morning--the problem with Washington is that everything is about political calculation.  It's never about doing the right thing on behalf of the American people.  It's about, ""Is this going to help me?  Is this going to hurt me?  Does it help or hurt in my fundraising? Am I going to win or am I going to lose?"" LBJ did the right thing on civil rights because it was right for the
country.  You cannot become a transformational president, we cannot become transformational people if everything is about media, market, and political calculation; and that's what's wrong with these very graphs, that nobody's getting to the heart of the fact that Americans are  dying in this debate.  We've never talked about even health disparities.  I was in Chicago yesterday.  Thirty-two hundred black folk every year die in  Chicago just because of health disparities.  So it's--we got to move beyond this--again, I'm not naive here, but we got to move beyond political calculation if we're going to advance these big issues in America."
232,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but do you think that congressmen, the two of which I just cited, are they capable of moving beyond that calculation?"
233,"MR. SMILEY:  I, I don't, I don't know them personally.  I think Washington in general has not, has not proven of late that they're capable."
234,"MR. GREGORY:  Because if they, if they feel that they want to, they still have to get through the clearing gate of an election."
235,MR. SMILEY:  Absolutely.
236,MR. GREGORY:  And that's the reality.
237,"MR. SMILEY:  Yeah.  I don't know them personally, I just know..."
238,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
239,"MR. SMILEY:  ...that when you look at Washington at a glance, it certainly appears, I think, to the everyday American... "
240,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, Ed, and so, the, the question in '94 was, was it better for Republicans to have a bill passed or not to have a bill passed?"
241,MR. GILLESPIE:  Yeah.
242,MR. GREGORY:  What's better for Republicans in 2010?
243,"MR. GILLESPIE:  Well, I think actually to run against this bill--look, when this bill passes, people say, ""Oh, it's going to get better over time."" I don't think that's the case.  I think as the details of what's in there gets out there more, voters hear about it, understand it.  I understand there's $10 billion in funding for the IRS to collect the new  taxes, to enforce the individual mandate.  It would take 16,500 new IRS officials to do all of this. This is massive.  And when people see it, and I know Democrats take umbrage to ""Oh, it's government takeover,"" it is a government takeover.  That's what's going on here.  And the voters are going to see it, and they're going to reject it.  And, and one last thing, sorry, but..."
244,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
245,"MR. GILLESPIE:  ...you know, yes, politics.  We live in a representative democracy and the majority of voters think this is a bad idea, and the majority in Congress are going to disregard that and do it anyway.  And the majority of voters, I believe, in November are going to say, ""OK, well, we told you so."""
246,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Well, President Bush also got the surge through when the public was against the war. "
247,"MR. GILLESPIE:  I agree with that, David.  There's no doubt about it. And, and, look, there are, there are times and I think national security is an area where I think, as commander-in-chief, you have to.  You have a moral obligation to do that.  I know the president feels he has a moral obligation to do this.  I think the voters will see it differently.  I also think the outcomes will be different.  The surge worked.  I don't think this bill's going to work."
248,"MS. DUNN:  You know, after this bill becomes law, the Earth is not going to stop spinning on its axis, David, OK?  The sky is not going to fall. And I think that the, the Republican characterization of the bill, a ""government takeover, next week you won't get to go see your doctor, you're going to be kicked out of your insurance and some bureaucrat in Washington is going to take over,"" which doesn't happen, it just won't happen, that I think that the way the Republicans have framed this thing and the scare tactics they've used will work against them once this becomes law because the bad things will not happen."
249,"MR. GREGORY:  But you--don't you have to concede, as Leader Hoyer did, and this goes to your point, I think, Tavis... "
250,MR. SMILEY:  Yeah.
251,"MR. GREGORY:  ...which is there may be celebrations in the White House and on Capitol Hill if this thing gets done, but there are a lot of assumptions about this bill, including the financing, including the budgetary impacts, that you cannot take to the bank unless future Congresses have the courage to live up to all the obligations that this Congress didn't have the courage to do.  Fair point?"
252,"MS. DUNN:  Here's the deal, David, which is the assumptions in the bill about both the spending piece and the savings piece, do depend on future action, but this Congress is showing amazing courage of putting the framework in place.  I also have to tell you, throughout this debate, the
Republicans have loved to cite CBO when they're talking about spending, and they ignore them when they're talking about the savings.  It's necessary to do this, to reduce costs in the long run.  And this Congress is showing the courage, and future ones will as well."
253,MR. GREGORY:  I got to make that the last word.  To be continued.  It's going to be a dynamic day.  Thank you all. 
254,"Up next, our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE, remembering Liz Carpenter, a pioneer in journalism, politics, and the women's right movement, who died yesterday at the age of 89, after this brief station break. "
255,(Announcements)
256,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We are back with our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE, remembering noted feminist, prolific author, and celebrated humorist Liz Carpenter.  She died yesterday at the age of 89.  Carpenter started her career as a newspaper reporter and went on to become the first female executive assistant to Vice President Lyndon Johnson and then the press secretary to the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson.  Carpenter appeared here on MEET THE PRESS in 1977 as the co-founder of the National Women's Political Caucus to debate the Equal Rights Amendment with Phyllis Schlafly, the founder and national chairman of Stop ERA."
257,"(Videotape, November 20, 1977)"
258,"MS. ELLEN GOODMAN:  Ms. Carpenter, we seem to be reading polls this morning. I read a poll this morning by a Catholic organization which said that 68 percent of the Catholics were pro-ERA but anti-abortion.  These two issues have been linked very strongly in the minds of the public. You are either pro-ERA and pro-abortion or anti-ERA and anti-abortion. Yet there seems to be quite a split.  And has the ERAmerica done anything?  Is--are women who are anti-abortion welcome in the pro-ERA movement?"
259,"MS. LIZ CARPENTER:  Absolutely.  As a matter of fact, I, I hope that America will read the national plan of action because it will deny a great many of the things that Mrs. Schlafly has been saying across this country.  The ERA has nothing to do with abortion, nothing to do with
co-ed bathrooms, nothing to do with all of the horrors which she has spread across the country in speeches throughout the country.  Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex.  It simply says that."
260,(End videotape)
261,"MR. GREGORY:  One other note about Carpenter:  On that tragic day, November 22, 1963, the day President John F.  Kennedy was assassinated, Carpenter, as an aide to Vice President Johnson, drafted the 58 words Johnson spoke to a grief-stricken nation."
262,(Videotape)
263,"PRES. LYNDON B. JOHNSON:  This is a sad time for all people.  We have suffered a loss that cannot be weighed.  For me, it is a deep personal tragedy.  I know that the world shares the sorrow that Mrs. Kennedy and her family bear.  I will do my best.  That is all I can do.  I ask for
your help and God's."
264,(End videotape)
265,MR. GREGORY:  Liz Carpenter and her family are in our thoughts and prayers this morning.  We'll be right back. 
266,(Announcements)
267,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  That's all for today.  Stay with NBC News and MSNBC for complete coverage of the historic House vote later today, including a wrap-up on ""Nightly News"" tonight.  We'll be back next week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY: This Sunday: The president makes history with healthcare reform, but the fight is far from over. 
    "
1,(Videotape) 
2,"Unidentified Man: I think the slogan will be repeal and replace, repeal and replace. "
3,PRES. BARACK OBAMA: They're actually going to run on a platform of repeal in November. We've been hearing that. And my attitude is go for it! 
4,(End videotape) 
5,"MR. GREGORY: Will reform work and what are its real economic consequences? Plus, what does it mean for the rest of the president's agenda--jobs, climate change, and immigration? A debate this morning between Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat from New York, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican from South Carolina. "
6,"Then, the political fallout, rage against Washington, have opponents gone too far? And will voter anger sweep Democrats from power in November as Republicans hope a repeal healthcare message returns the GOP to power in Congress. Insights and analysis from our roundtable: Presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, Newsweek editor Jon Meacham, Republican strategist Mike Murphy, and Democratic strategist Bob Shrum. "
7,"Finally in our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE, we look back at another major piece of healthcare legislation that had Congressional Republicans talking about repeal. "
8,"But first, the vote may be over, but the debate over healthcare reform and its effects continues. With us this morning, Senators Chuck Schumer and Lindsey Graham. They have escaped the pressure cooker of Washington and gone back home. "
9,Where no doubt your constituents will have a lot to say about the legacy of healthcare reform. Welcome to both of you. 
10,SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D-NY): Morning. 
11,SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you. 
12,"MR. GREGORY: Let me ask you about this legacy question. Senator Schumer, is it going to be that millions of additional Americans are covered with health insurance, or is it going to be headlines like we saw this week that AT&T and other companies will take a billion-dollar charge because of lost deductions as a result of this law and that ultimately they may provide fewer benefits to their, to their employees? "
13,"SEN. SCHUMER: Well, I think as people learn about the bill, and now that the bill is enacted, it's going to become more and more popular. And here's why, two things happen, David. First, the lies that have been spread, they vanish because you see what's in the bill. We had ""death panels"" in the summer. People are going to see there are no death panels. ""Illegal immigrants are going to get health care,"" it's clear that's not true in the bill. And the number one lie that bothers people is ""You'll lose your insurance if you have it now and you're pretty happy with it."" I had a firefighter come to me at the Rockville Centre St. Patrick's Day parade last Saturday, he was all upset, he said, ""I'm going to lose my health benefits."" I said, ""Where do you work?"" He said, ""I'm a New York City firefighter."" Well, this bill isn't going to touch his benefits, which are very good. And, as we go through the next several months, he'll, he'll learn that and feel much better about the bill. "
14,"Then, at the same time, the positives are going to start weighing in. Senior citizens will get much better opportunities to buy prescription drugs, which we know they care about. Small businesses will get tax breaks so they'll be either able to cover their employees--many small business people want to but can't afford it--or keep the coverage if they have it already. People will be less likely to be--have their insurance policies canceled when they get sick. That's a big thing to people. "
15,MR. GREGORY: All right. 
16,"SEN. SCHUMER: And then there's a little hidden one, just one final one. If you're up to 26 years old you can stay on your parents' health coverage. My daughter is graduating from law school. We told her the day after she graduates she's on her own. She has a job in September, but she was fretting what does she do for the four months? Does she buy health insurance for $1200 a month? Well, she called me up at midnight after the bill passed and said, ""Dad, I'm covered."" "
17,MR. GREGORY: Senator... 
18,"SEN. SCHUMER: ""I'm--I feel great."" There are going to be millions of calls like that. So I predict, David, by November those who voted for health care will find it an asset, those who voted against it will find it a liability. "
19,"MR. GREGORY: All right. Well, we'll go through this in greater detail. "
20,"Senator Graham, the same legacy question for you, but here's the backdrop in terms of what people actually think about this. After all has been said and done, a 13-month pitched battle over this, whereas the president said, ""Everybody had their peace on this. Every, every opinion was aired,"" and this is the polling from The Washington Post out this morning, 50 percent still oppose healthcare reform. What's the legacy? "
21,"SEN. GRAHAM: Well, I think it's going to be on the Medicare front that we're going to take $570 billion out of Medicare, which is already $34 trillion underfunded, and give it to somebody else. So the legacy for Medicare is going to be devastating. If you're a senior citizen in South Carolina and New York, you're going to lose your Medicare Advantage. The legacy on taxes is going to be enormous, from 2014 to 2023 a trillion dollars in additional taxes. The legacy for student loans is going to be terrible because, in this bill, the federal government takes over the student loan program; and if you think Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did a good job with housings, wait till the government runs student loans, $9 billion taken out of the student loan program to pay for health care. So the process that led to this bill was sleazy. It was the worst of Washington, it was not transparent. The substance of this bill is massive in terms of taxes and compromising Medicare, and there's a bunch of tricks and gimmicks in the bill like--you've heard about AT&T, it's going to come up and bite the American people. So we're going to have a spirited civil contest on the size and shape of government, and health care will be center stage. "
22,"MR. GREGORY: Senator Graham, despite what you say, is a campaign of repeal--you're a pragmatic legislator--is that realistic? "
23,"SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. Only if you replace it. It is realistic to let the American people know the Class Act, which is a new entitlement where the government offers long-term healthcare insurance to the population, collects $78 billion in premiums to use to be paid for this bill. So when you--the money's spent to pay for the healthcare bill, and when you need your Class Act coverage, there's no money there. It is good to repeal the cuts in Medicare and to repeal the, the massive tax increases and replace it with opportunities to buy insurance in the private sector without cutting Medicare and raising taxes and using budget--Ponzi schemes like the Class Act. Yes, there's a way to do that. And 16 million people are dumped into Medicaid. My state is going to get killed by having to serve more Medicaid people; it's going to hurt state budgets. Finally, this fight won't wind up being just in Washington; it's going to spread to every statehouse in the nation, and we're going to have referendums on this bill through every statehouse in the nation. Can the states afford what Washington did to them? "
24,"MR. GREGORY: It is a, it is a big point. Let me break this down a little bit, now that we've kind of established some of the terrain, into some of the more specific costs and benefits. And let's, let's try to narrow this in our answers to, to these particular topics. "
25,"Here is the, the price of the bill, Senator Schumer: $938 billion over the course of 10 years. The big question that a lot of people have to ask is whether this really comes in with the price tag that the government says it will. And there are some nonpartisan deficit watchdog groups who have real questions about this, including the Concord Coalition that issued a statement last Sunday after the bill was passed, and I'll put it up on the screen. ""Even if everything goes according to plan, the promised deficit reduction will be quite modest compared to the trillions of dollars that current projections indicate the country will add to its debt in the coming decade. Political leaders will still need to look for large amounts of additional savings and revenue - both in the healthcare system and elsewhere. Moreover, they will have to do so with much of the potential savings having already been claimed for the expanded coverage in the new legislation. "
26,"""This is not the end of the cost control fight. It is a very tentative beginning."" Bottom line, Senator Schumer, you're covering 30 million additional people. How do you do that without busting the budget in a, in a final analysis? "
27,"SEN. SCHUMER: Well, you know, the CBO is very conservative, they don't give benefit to things that will happen. For instance, if you pay for preventing diabetes today and then you don't have to do a major operation on someone because they're in the final stages of diabetes 10 years from now--CBO doesn't give you that benefit. So I think, if anything, they underestimate the savings, and they say $130 billion in savings the first 10 years and then, when the bill really kicks in, a trillion. Look, David, everyone knows our healthcare system is very wasteful. It delivers good health care for most people, but one-third of all dollars don't go to health care. It's the most inefficient system we have. And, and with doing nothing, the price keeps going up 10, 12 percent a year. Without this bill, Medicare would have gone broke in seven years. "
28,"MR. GREGORY: But, but Senator Schumer... "
29,"SEN. SCHUMER: Now people say, now people say it's, it's, it's 12 more--it has 12 more years of life. So I think you're going to find--this is the first attempt in the history of health care to get at the waste, the fraud, the abuse, the duplication. Everyone's experienced it, you're on a gurney, they say, ""Oh, there's Dr. Wilson."" He waves, and then you look at the bill and he's--they've charged $4,000 for him, and you don't know what he did. That kind of stuff has to go. "
30,MR. GREGORY: I know that. But my question has to do with... 
31,SEN. SCHUMER: We're attempting to do it. 
32,"MR. GREGORY: ...whether this is a realistic time, all right? It's easy to say, ""Yeah, 10 years down the road we're going to have deficit reduction."" But the truth is, a future Congress--not until 2018 is Congress going to actually raise taxes on these gold-plated plans to raise some of the money for this. You really think Congress is going to have courage down the line that it didn't have this year? "
33,"SEN. SCHUMER: You bet. And that's why it's been crafted the way it is, to be realistic. But some of the cost-cutting will go into effect right away. Everyone knows the waste, the fraud, the abuse, the duplication in the system. The answer on the other side is do nothing, repeal it. We have to get a handle on costs. And for me, at least, the number one rationale for this bill--I think it's important to cover people--but the most important thing to do is get a handle on the costs that are out of control, that are killing business, killing individuals, and killing our federal deficit. Does this do everything in that regard? No. Is it the first major step to do it in a very large way? You bet. And in the second 10 years, when it really bites, because you can't do all this overnight... "
34,MR. GREGORY: OK. 
35,SEN. SCHUMER: ...they predict a trillion dollars in savings. 
36,SEN. GRAHAM: Hello? I can't hear. I lost him. 
37,"MR. GREGORY: Senator, Senator... "
38,SEN. SCHUMER: The biggest savings that we've ever seen in any federal program. 
39,MR. GREGORY: OK. 
40,SEN. GRAHAM: I lost him. 
41,MR. GREGORY: Senator Graham I think has some difficulty hearing us. 
42,"SEN. GRAHAM: I disagree with Chuck, in case you didn't hear me. "
43,"MR. GREGORY: OK, consider--Senator Graham, if you can hear us now... "
44,SEN. GRAHAM: Can't hear a word. 
45,"MR. GREGORY: ...what is your response? He still, he still can't hear us. "
46,"Let me move on to another issue, and we'll get Senator Graham back in here in just a minute. "
47,"Senator Schumer, you wrote a book a few years back in 2007, and this is what it was called, ""Positively American: Winning Back the Middle-Class Majority One Family at a Time."" The chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, has said this will be a middle-class tax--excuse me, a middle-class healthcare bill. And yet if you look at our polling, middle-income Americans who are asked about this healthcare bill are roundly opposed to it. Fifty-eight percent say this is not a good idea. How does this deliver, then, for the middle class? "
48,"SEN. SCHUMER: Well, it really does deliver for the middle class. But, as I said, there are lots of, lots of misinformation. That firefighter in Rockville Centre, and you could repeat that with tens of millions of families, are worried. People ask themselves, particularly at a time of recession, ""How is it going to affect me?"" They've been told by special interests that are against the bill that they will lose their coverage. People who have coverage now, whether through an employer or Medicare, will keep it and it will get better, actually, because the waste and the duplication will, will be cut back greatly. They'll keep it longer, they'll keep it better, they'll pay less. So this is a bill aimed at the middle class. And my point being, if you look at a snapshot poll today, some of them show--there was one that was 49-40 in favor of health care, this one's against it. But I would predict to you, and I feel very, very strongly about this and firmly about this, that as people learn what's actually in the bill, that six months from now, by election time, this is going to be a plus because the parade of horribles, particularly the worry that the average middle-class person has that this is going to affect them negatively... "
49,MR. GREGORY: OK. 
50,"SEN. SCHUMER: ...will have vanished, and they'll see that it'll affect them positively in many ways, some of which I mentioned. "
51,"MR. GREGORY: Let me get Senator Graham back in here. The, the question, before we, we lost your ability to communicate with you... "
52,SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. Yeah. 
53,MR. GREGORY: ...was whether this is really going to come in at cost. 
54,"SEN. GRAHAM: Well, no, it's a giant Ponzi scheme. Let's look at the claim that it saves $138 billion in terms of reducing the deficit. If you assume paying a doctor is part of health care, there's nothing in this bill for the doctor fix. Next week or two weeks from now, we will try to forgive cuts to doctors. Over the next 10 years, doctors are supposed to be cut by $21 billion. "
55,Can you hear me? Hello. 
56,"MR. GREGORY: Yeah, hear you fine. Hear you fine. "
57,SEN. GRAHAM: Hello? 
58,"MR. GREGORY: Continue--OK, we've lost Senator, Senator Graham again. "
59,"SEN. SCHUMER: Hey, I like the show this way. "
60,"MR. GREGORY: Yeah, right. "
61,SEN. SCHUMER: It's pretty good. 
62,"MR. GREGORY: These things happen from time to time. But he, he's, he's still making a point about the cost issue not coming in, that ultimately future Congresses, like with the doctor fix... "
63,SEN. SCHUMER: Yeah. 
64,"MR. GREGORY: ...are going to keep restoring payments to doctors when--in order to meet the budget of this plan. You know, you're not going--you're going to have to do that over time. "
65,"SEN. SCHUMER: Yeah, let me, let me say this. There are many doctors who--most do a very good job. There are a number, maybe 10 percent, who spend all their time maximizing income. Right now as we speak, there's some salesman talking to a doctor and saying, ""Hey, if you buy this machine for a million dollars, my company'll finance it. We'll then show you how to fill it up 100 percent of the time with patients and you'll make $200,000 more a year,"" and even though there's another machine a couple of miles away and the machine's not needed. Right now there's no check on that kind of waste. Our bill does it. Doctors who go overboard and provide tons of quantity and no quality will be disciplined here. Again, CBO is bipartisan, everyone goes by its estimates and it's known to be conservative. It's driven us nuts, because we think there are many more savings in the bill that they didn't score. But even taking them at their face, $138 billion these 10 years, that's a lot of savings. "
66,"MR. GREGORY: All right, let me get Senator... "
67,SEN. SCHUMER: A trillion next year... 
68,"MR. GREGORY: All right, Senator Schumer... "
69,SEN. SCHUMER: ...that's a lot of savings. 
70,MR. GREGORY: ...let me get Senator Graham in here. 
71,"Senator Graham, if you can hear us now, I promise Schumer is not... "
72,"SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, I can. Yeah. "
73,"MR. GREGORY: ...playing with the, the, the cables here. "
74,SEN. GRAHAM: No. 
75,"MR. GREGORY: But you, you have the floor here. You know what some of the discussion has been. What is your view? "
76,"SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, I do, I do. Well, there's a reason no Republican voted for this thing. It's not that we don't care about people and we don't want to lower costs. This lost its focus. It got to--there's a noble effort started by the president, then it got to be, ""I got to pass the bill because my presidency's at stake."" This idea it reduces the deficit is a flat-out lie. You don't include the money we're going to spend to fix the doctor problem, which is $200 billion. So they took it out of the healthcare bill and put it in the, in the jobs bill to make it look like it cuts the deficit. If you add the money we're all going to spend to help doctors not get cuts, that wipes out the deficit. "
77,"You spend Medicare money twice. You take $570 billion out of Medicare to pay for the healthcare bill, then you're using that same $570 to say it lowers the growth of Medicare over time. It's a giant Ponzi scheme. You create a new entitlement called the Class Act where you sell long-term health insurance to the public. You take the premiums and you don't keep them in the system, you pay for this healthcare bill. Where does the money come from when they need the health care? So it's a house of cards. It is a Ponzi scheme of the first order. It's going to blow up the deficit. It's going to affect every business, every family in this country. It was done by one-party rule, and it was an--it was a shame we had to go down this road, and there will be a contest in this country. President Obama ran as a centrist. He's governed from the left ditch in a right of center nation, and it's just not health care. It's taking over General Motors, it's the stimulus bill that's just completely out of control. And now taking over student loans. I look forward to a contest in November about whether this healthcare bill is a real fix or a phony political document trying to... "
78,MR. GREGORY: Can I... 
79,SEN. GRAHAM: ...grow the government. And I think... 
80,"MR. GREGORY: Senator Graham, let me... "
81,SEN. GRAHAM: ...that's what it is. 
82,"MR. GREGORY: Senator Graham, let me, let me stay with you on the tone of the debate and then look a little bit forward about the rest of the president's agenda. "
83,SEN. GRAHAM: Yes. 
84,"MR. GREGORY: Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke this week after we had seen instances of some violence or attacks on offices of members of Congress, nasty phone messages and all the rest. And this is what she said on Thursday. "
85,"(Videotape, Thursday) "
86,"REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I believe that words have power. They weigh a ton. And they are received differently by people in--depending on their, shall we say, emotional state. And we have to take responsibility for words that are said that we do not reject. "
87,(End videotape) 
88,"MR. GREGORY: When you hear from conservatives--whether they be popular politicians outside of office, party officials, members of Congress--describe healthcare reform as socialism, an attack on freedom, ushering in totalitarianism, does that contribute to an atmosphere where opponents can go too far? "
89,"SEN. GRAHAM: Well, in my view, I think attacking this bill in terms of expanding government beyond anybody's imagination, where 80 percent of the country at the end of the day will be covered by a healthcare bill that is not paid for, that can never be paid for, is a legitimate debate. But when you use the N word and when you question somebody's patriotism, you're off base. President Obama is a fine man. He's a good father, he's a good role model. He's an American liberal. The reason I don't say he's a socialist, because most people associate that with being un-American. He is an American just as much as anybody else. The idea that he's very liberal I think is pretty clear to the American people. He ran as a centrist, he's governing from the left ditch, that's his big problem. And we don't need to call each other names. "
90,MR. GREGORY: Right. 
91,"SEN. GRAHAM: Chuck Schumer and I come from very different backgrounds, and we're going to work together to do some hard things. So let's focus civilly on the major differences of the role of government in our lives and what's honest and what's not, and, and impart the rhetoric in a personal way. "
92,"MR. GREGORY: Senator Schumer, have opponents gone too far? "
93,"SEN. SCHUMER: Well, obviously there are some people way off the deep end, but you don't condemn a whole group or a whole movement for the outliers. You just ask the people who are responsible--left, right and center, Democrat and Republican--to condemn the bad words, the condemn the violence. That's been done. I've heard even the head of some of the tea party people condemn the violence. So I agree with Lindsey, I'm raring to go for a debate on the merits, because I think we win that debate and we don't need the distractions. "
94,"MR. GREGORY: Well, let's talk about the rest of the agenda, then, when it comes to... "
95,SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. 
96,"MR. GREGORY: ...immigration reform, where you two have come together to, to seek out a path toward immigration reform; or whether it's climate change, financial regulation and all the rest. There's real questions about whether there has been a poisoning of the well here, Senator Graham. Your friend Senator McCain said there will be no more cooperation with Democrats in the White House this year. And this is what the New York Daily News wrote in an op-ed this week as well. ""Senator Lindsey Graham, long been a thoughtful and constructive legislator. But the South Carolina Republican made a statement last week that showed why Washington is losing the public's trust and his party in particular is losing its sense of duty. "
97,"""Graham had joined with Senator Schumer to present a well-reasoned outline for immigration reform. Then Graham threatened to walk away from his own proposal. `If the healthcare bill goes through this weekend, that will, in my view, pretty much kill any chance of immigration reform passing the Senate this year.'"" "
98,What do you say? 
99,"SEN. GRAHAM: Well, I'm just being honest. I'm going to work with Chuck Schumer to come up with legislation to control China's manipulation of their currency. I will keep working with Chuck on immigration. But here's the effect, immigration's tough. You don't have to ask anybody other than me to tell you that. It is a tough heavy lift. The president promised to pass an immigration reform bill in his first year. They've done almost nothing in the White, White House on immigration. We've been absorbed by health care. People are risk averse. If a moderate Democrat got a phone call from the president, he wants you to come down to the White House and help him with immigration now, most of them would jump out the window. That's just the truth. I will continue to work with Chuck, but immigration is a heavy lift. We haven't done the things necessary to bring the body together, and 16 Democrats voted against immigration reform. This idea that I would be the 60th vote on immigration, climate change could not be further from the truth. Tough sledding lies ahead because of the, the acrimony around health care. But on financial regulations we'll get a bill. I hope it's a good bill, not some liberal bill with a few, a few Republicans. "
100,MR. GREGORY: Senator... 
101,SEN. GRAHAM: I look forward to working with Chuck. 
102,"MR. GREGORY: Senator Schumer, is immigration reform dead then? "
103,"SEN. SCHUMER: I don't think so. First, let's look at how desperately we need it. Fifteen thousand people cross our border illegally every day. Most of them take jobs from Americans. And yet, at the same time, there are certain people we need in this economy to help us grow, and we can't get them--engineers, doctors, farm workers. So the system is broken--it lets the wrong people in, excludes the wrong people--and so we need to fix it. "
104,"Now, Lindsey and I have worked for a year. We've put out a framework that goes by what we think most Americans believe. Most Americans are anti illegal immigration and pro legal immigration. And we're real close. We're real close. "
105,SEN. GRAHAM: Right. 
106,"SEN. SCHUMER: We do need a second Republican to come on the bill, and Lindsey, to his credit, and he's got a lot a courage to step forward here, I salute him, has always said we need that. But I would plead with him, if we can get that second Republican, we have business and labor ready to sign on. We have all the religious community, not just the liberals but the evangelicals. We even have Lou Dobbs and Bill O'Reilly saying positive things about our proposal. I would urge that we try to get this done... "
107,MR. GREGORY: All right. 
108,SEN. SCHUMER: ...because it's so important for America. 
109,SEN. GRAHAM: If I... 
110,"MR. GREGORY: Quickly, Senator. "
111,"SEN. GRAHAM: If I could say something. I urge, I urge the president to write a bill and see if he can get another Republican, see if he can convince the 16 Democrats who voted no last time. "
112,"SEN. SCHUMER: Oh, he will. "
113,SEN. GRAHAM: Let him do some heavy lifting here on immigration. 
114,MR. GREGORY: All right. 
115,SEN. SCHUMER: When the president... 
116,SEN. GRAHAM: Write a bill and send it to me. 
117,SEN. SCHUMER: The president will. 
118,SEN. GRAHAM: I'd be glad to look at it. 
119,MR. GREGORY: I'm going to make that the last word. 
120,"SEN. SCHUMER: The president supported our framework, and he'll be right up front in helping us. We just... "
121,SEN. GRAHAM: Good. 
122,SEN. SCHUMER: We just need to move forward. 
123,"MR. GREGORY: Before I let you go, Senator Graham... "
124,SEN. GRAHAM: Look forward to it. 
125,MR. GREGORY: ...are you concerned about these recess appointments from President Obama? 
126,SEN. GRAHAM: Yes. It's going to make problems worse. 
127,MR. GREGORY: How so? 
128,SEN. SCHUMER: Can I say something? 
129,"SEN. GRAHAM: Well, Becker is, Becker is a guy... "
130,SEN. SCHUMER: All right. 
131,"SEN. GRAHAM: ...who wants card check by regulation, and, at the end of the day, they're really pushing forward here rather than trying to bring this together. Financial regulation has some bipartisan hope. I hope we'll seize the moment there and try to get a bipartisan financial regulation bill. "
132,MR. GREGORY: Senator Schumer? 
133,"SEN. SCHUMER: Let me just say this, David, about recess appointments. They're holding up 77 people. The head of the TSA, we need that, some people in, in, in the Defense Department and the Treasury Department, 77 people. And so we have no choice but to do recess appointments. If we spent a week on each of these people they're holding up, and many of them get voted on 99 to nothing after they hold them up, we'd do nothing else. "
134,MR. GREGORY: All right. 
135,"SEN. SCHUMER: George Bush did more recess appointments in, at this point, than President Obama has done. Reagan has done them. Clinton has done them. If they'd let us vote on these people, we wouldn't have to do the recess appointments. "
136,"MR. GREGORY: I'm going to, I'm going to... "
137,SEN. SCHUMER: But they don't. 
138,"MR. GREGORY: I'm going to leave it there. Senator Schumer, Senator Graham, all of this to be continued. Thank you both very much. "
139,"SEN. SCHUMER: Hi, Lindsey. Bye, Lindsey. "
140,"MR. GREGORY: Coming up next, now that healthcare reform is law, what does it mean for the remainder of the Obama presidency and the midterm elections? Insights from Republican strategist Mike Murphy, Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, plus presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, and Newsweek's Jon Meacham. Only on MEET THE PRESS. "
141,(Announcements) 
142,"MR. GREGORY: Healthcare reform, the political fallout. What will it mean for the rest of the president's agenda and the 2010 midterm elections, after this brief commercial break. "
143,(Announcements) 
144,"MR. GREGORY: We're back now, and joined by Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, Republican strategist Mike Murphy, presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, and Newsweek editor Jon Meacham. "
145,"Welcome to all of you. Quite a week. Quite a week of history and an, an important week for the Obama presidency. Here is the president on Tuesday signing healthcare reform into law. "
146,"(Videotape, Tuesday) "
147,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA: After a century of striving, after a year of debate, after a historic vote, healthcare reform is no longer an unmet promise. It is the law of the land. It is the law of the land. "
148,(End videotape) 
149,"MR. GREGORY: And Joe Biden, the vice president, seemed to say it best when he said with such vigor that this was a big deal. "
150,"Certainly the late Senator Kennedy, Bob Shrum, was part of all of this in spirit. His son Patrick Kennedy went to his graveside and penned a note that was photographed that said, ""Dad, the unfinished business is done."" This was a big deal. "
151,"MR. BOB SHRUM: It was a big deal. The last time I was here was the week he was lost. This is the week that the cause for which he spent so much of his life has been won. He would be the first person, by the way, to say, ""Now we have to move on; we have other great challenges in this society."" But it was a wonderful week, if you had been with him as I had for 40 years in the center of this fight, to finally see it get done because, you know, there was always a sense maybe this never would happen. He never thought that, by the way. He wrote a thing last summer, one of the last things he wrote, saying, ""We're almost there."" Now we're there. "
152,"MR. GREGORY: Previous presidents couldn't achieve this, Jon Meacham. There is even this, this photo that was kind of interesting between Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State, and the president. Look at that embrace. I mean, she and her husband, former President Clinton, tried to achieve this and could not. To what extent is this what puts Barack Obama in the history books? "
153,"MR. MEACHAM: Well, it certainly changes the short-term narrative. Remember, about a month ago he was dead, dead, dead, and now he's--you're asking about what he's going to be in the history books. So I think it's a... "
154,MR. GREGORY: Right. 
155,"MR. MEACHAM: ...a cautionary lesson to all of us who, who render instant judgments. But he managed to do something that they've been trying to do since Theodore Roosevelt. And for all the rage and all the rawness that's out there, which is very ugly and very disturbing and, to my mind, disproportionate to, to the legislation, this is, as John Dingle has said, somewhat to the right of where Richard Nixon was. And so I think we should remember that as, as important this is, we need to look at it proportionately and with a sense of balance. "
156,"MR. GREGORY: Speaking about balance, Mike Murphy, there's a lot of Republicans who, who seek a little balance in all of this discussion of history. There's a, a congressman who wrote on his Web site, ""Just because it's historic doesn't mean it's good."" "
157,"MR. MURPHY: Well, I think that's right. I, I think it's a bad bill. I'm a conservative. I don't like it because it's not about cost, it's only about access, and the access problem is ultimately driven by cost. So I think the truth of this is it's only the end of the beginning on health care. "
158,MR. GREGORY: Mm-hmm. 
159,"MR. MURPHY: The Congress we're going to have after the November elections, I can't tell you the magnitude, but I'd be willing to make a bet, is going to be a different kind of Congress. It may still be Democratic, but the numbers will be much tighter. This bill couldn't pass that Congress because the country doesn't like this bill. So this thing, the implementation, it is a long-term here, this is only the beginning. And I believe that four to five years from now, when this bill really would start to take effect, the same bill will not be on the books, it'll be different. "
160,"MR. GREGORY: But let's--well, we're going to get more into the politics... "
161,MR. MURPHY: Mm-hmm. 
162,MR. GREGORY: ...there's so much to discuss there. 
163,"Doris, this question of history. If we put this into some kind of historical context, thinking of you this week, we were thinking about FDR, and we found this sound bite from him signing Social Security into law back in 1935. Here's what he said. "
164,"(Videotape, August 14, 1935) "
165,"PRES. FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT: It seems to me that if the Senate and the House of Representatives in this long and arduous session had done nothing more than pass this security bill, Social Security Act, the session would be regarded as historic for all time. "
166,(End videotape) 
167,"MR. GREGORY: Historic but also arduous, and certainly health care was. And if you look at the tone of this debate, some of the calls for violence, some of the violence against congressional offices, racial epithets, all the rest, you heard Senator Graham say the process was ""sleazy,"" it harkens back to another time. "
168,"MS. GOODWIN: Well, each time we've passed one of these major legislations, there's been a lot of turmoil around them. I mean, after Social Security, for example, in 1936, Landon, which we were just talking about before, ran to repeal that bill. He claimed in the '36 election that in your paycheck they would be taking out the payroll tax and you'd never get it back. And he ran on that issue, and he won a huge election, FDR did, as a result because he fought back. I think the key thing that the legacy is not simply what this is going to do for the future but what it's done, which you started on, to Obama's leadership. You know, when LBJ got civil rights through in '64, he said it felt so incredible inside to have done something that will make life better for millions of Americans. He said, ""Now I'm going for voting rights. Now I'm going for Medicare."" It emboldens a president. The fact that it was so tough in the Congress, and it became difficult, they're in the trenches together, they've come out more unified, the Democrats. The party has its morale back up. Even the, the sense of the countries abroad, he's a winner, he won something. I agree with you that the battle's only begun, because the battle of public sentiment was never won by the Obama people. The Republicans won it with the ""death panels,"" they won it maybe with falsehoods, but still the majority of the people still don't feel good about this bill. So they still have a lot to do, I think, to compress their arguments and make sure that they reach the country. Lincoln once said, to go back to yet another guy, as he claims I always do... "
169,MR. MEACHAM: It's Sunday. 
170,"MR. GREGORY: If it's Doris, it's Lincoln and Roosevelt. "
171,"MS. GOODWIN: OK, I promise, this is it. "
172,MR. MEACHAM: (Unintelligible) 
173,"MR. GREGORY: No, this is, this is--we love this. "
174,"MS. GOODWIN: This is the end. No, Lincoln once said that ""He who molds public sentiment is more important than he who passes laws."" "
175,MR. GREGORY: Mm. 
176,"MS. GOODWIN: That with public sentiment, everything's possible. Without it, nothing is. Public sentiment still has to be won. "
177,"MR. GREGORY: It, it, it raises the question, to Bob and Mike, you know, the, the--this president talked, as a campaigner, about being a transformational figure. And so what do we take away? What's a leadership lesson of this experience for this president, Bob? "
178,"MR. SHRUM: Well, well, first of all, I think there are some mistakes, and they would say there are some mistakes. They should have reassured the elderly at the very beginning that this didn't hurt Medicare, because if you look at the inside of that Washington Post poll, by 13 percent, people trust Democrats more on health care, and the center of the opposition to the bill is actually from seniors, and that could have been taken care of. But, you know, it's very hard to quarrel with the president who has achieved this kind of measure of social justice, the greatest measure in 50 years. Now, by the way, without the congressional majorities of the size that LBJ or FDR had, I think from here you have to go on and look at what's going to happen with financial reform, which Lindsay Graham sort of hinted is going to pass. "
179,MR. GREGORY: Yeah. 
180,"MR. SHRUM: I think it will. And at the end of 14 months, let alone the end of this year, you have a president with achievements of historic sweep: the largest economic recovery program in history; health care; the student loan reform, wholesale student loan reform, which by the way, was just tucked into the bill and hardly anybody talked about; and a major arms control treaty with the, with the, with the Russians. This is the beginning, I think, of a historic presidency that could be a great presidency and that could lead us into a whole new political era. And now Mike's going to disagree. "
181,"MR. MURPHY: I couldn't disagree more. In fact, I, I watched this debate, the new patina being applied to this, it reminds me of the old writers' room trick from the original ""Star Trek"" show, they used to do a great parallel thing where they'd do fake history, and they'd say, ""Oh, Plato, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Zingo of Zoron Five,"" you know, and they'd create kind of this equality of patina. This was a failure of leadership. The hard thing to do would have been to address cost in a bipartisan way, which is the real problem in health care. And that involves the insurance companies, it involves the docs, it involves the labor unions, it involves the trial lawyers, key constituency of the Democratic Parties, that didn't happen. What we got instead was a one-party muscular effort to put a lot more people into the current system, make some small insurance reforms, and flood the thing full of money to prop it up for a few years. This system they created with this bill can't stand, which is why I think it's written in pencil not pen. You can't get ahead of public opinion like this. You got to lead the country. This isn't leadership. This has divided the country, and it won't stand. "
182,MR. GREGORY: So if you... 
183,"MR. SHRUM: This is all a repetition of what was said about Medicare after it passed, what was said about Social Security after it passed. "
184,"MS. GOODWIN: You're right. Well, in fact, you know what Reagan said about Medicare at the time, he said that ""Some day after Medicare passes you're going to be telling your children's children, as senior citizens, that you once knew a time when America was free,"" because it's no longer free. And yet he didn't even move to dismantle it because it worked. So that's the key. The key is they have to make this work. They can come back and do cost controls more. "
185,MR. MURPHY: You think it will work? 
186,MS. GOODWIN: I think it will work. Because I think they... 
187,MR. MURPHY: I absolutely disagree. 
188,"MS. GOODWIN: This is the beginning. They can move forward, they can figure out--you know, it's not the end when these things pass, it's just the beginning. "
189,"MR. GREGORY: Well, let me ask about... "
190,"MR. MURPHY: I'm saying it's not the end, but it's not a solution either. "
191,"MR. GREGORY: All right. Well, let's... "
192,MR. MURPHY: It's a pun. 
193,MR. SHRUM: The 32 million people... 
194,"MR. MURPHY: It's, it's a solution... "
195,MR. SHRUM: ...who didn't have any health care... 
196,MR. GREGORY: Right. 
197,MR. SHRUM: ...it's a big solution. 
198,"MR. MURPHY: ...it's a solution for access, but you can't solve the access problem unless you solve cost. "
199,"MR. GREGORY: Well, there's also... "
200,MR. MURPHY: And it doesn't work. 
201,"MR. GREGORY: Whether it's a solution or not, you still--you bring up the political point about this. Here's the cover of The Economist, which says, ""What now for the president,"" or ""Now What?"" The, the subheadline is ""Barack Obama needs to use a bruising victory to unleash the promise of his presidency."" And here is the polling on this--so there's the substance, but then there's the perception. We showed this earlier, the new Washington Post poll, 50 percent still opposed on this. "
202,"Jon Meacham, in terms of mobilization of voters as we get toward the fall, who's more mobilized on this? "
203,"MR. MEACHAM: Well, right now the--I would say it's a pretty close call. The passion, and the passion that we pay attention to because it's so dramatic, and again, raw and tragically unfortunate, I think, the--when John Lewis can't walk across Capitol Hill without being spit on and called the worst thing he can be called, a man who helped change America, then we're out of, we're out of whack in a way that we should denounce in the way I think Republican leaders at the very highest levels love to hear from Senator Dole, from the Bushes, I mean you--this is something that, that should not stand. And my sense is that the right has the passion. But you know what, the left and the center of left just helped pass this bill, and we shouldn't forget that. There was a key moment in the, in the White House strategy here where they went back to the grass roots, and you could see it on the Web, you could feel it with the e-mails. They were trying to re-enage the people who helped Obama defeat, remember, the most formidable force in Democratic politics, the Clintons, in the year before. "
204,"MS. GOODWIN: You know, the tone, the tone of recent time really is troubling, I couldn't agree with you more. I mean, for those of us who live in the past, it's not as bad as the 1850s when congressmen and senators sported guns into the Congress. "
205,"MR. GREGORY: Not to suggest you were living in the 1850s, by the way. "
206,"MS. GOODWIN: No. Or the 1960s when there's bulldogs and whips against the civil rights marchers. But in the last 30 years or so, to hear the racial epithets, to hear the anti-gay thing, when we thought we were moving forward toward a more tolerant society, it shows we still have a far way to go. Frank Rich had an interesting article today where he said, ""This is not just about health care. Something bigger's going on."" Just like prohibition wasn't just about prohibition, it was the rurals against the city. Now it's people worrying that the country's becoming too homo--unhomogenous. There's a lot of minorities out there, and the whites are fearful of something that's going on. So something's out there. But the Democrats have got to mobilize their base just as the Republicans have mobilized theirs. "
207,"MR. GREGORY: But there are some bigger things going on here. You heard--and there was a piece in the Times this week, a reference to then candidate Obama talking about the Reagan legacy, that there ought to be bottom-up wealth created rather than just trickle down. And Ron Brownstein wrote something that caught my eye this week about the difficulty for Democrats among some voting groups. He wrote this: ""The belief that Washington has transferred benefits up the income ladder is pervasive across society but especially pronounced among white voters with less than a college education, the group that most resisted Obama in 2008."" The Hillary Clinton voter in a lot of the primaries. ""Now health care could threaten Democrats from the opposite direction by stoking old fears, particularly among the white working class, that liberals are transferring income down the income ladder to the `less deserving.'"" You know, there are some tight races in Pennsylvania, say, or in Ohio, where this could be a factor. "
208,"MR. SHRUM: You know, Chuck Schumer went through what's going to happen immediately with this bill, from 26-year-olds being on the--being covered on their parents' policies to help for small business to preventing cancellation of your insurance when you get sick. All that's going to happen right away, and people are going to live with the reality of this bill, not the caricatures. I think that what's happened to the Republicans--and I think they will pay a longer term price for this, by the way--is that some of them got married to the mob and they stood outside on the steps of the Capitol, went on that balcony, and they encouraged people to do this. The, the words of that mob were echoed inside with words like ""Armageddon"" and ""baby killer."" Americans don't like extremists, and when they find out this bill isn't extreme--you know, it's actually your friend Mitt Romney's bill, and he's trying to kind of... "
209,"MR. MEACHAM: No, it's not at all. "
210,"MR. SHRUM: He's kind of try--oh, no, come on, everybody concedes it. "
211,MR. MURPHY: The mandate is... 
212,MR. MEACHAM: That's...(unintelligible). 
213,"MR. MURPHY: The mandate is, but not the bill. "
214,MR. SHRUM: He--you know what his answers--you know what his answer is? 
215,"MR. MURPHY: That's unfair, Bob. It's not true. "
216,"MR. SHRUM: His answer is it should be done on a state-by-state basis. They then show a film of him from the 2008 campaign where he says it ought to be a national model. You know what's happened here? The Scott Brown era is the shortest era in the history of American politics, and he helped us pass the bill. Because once he got there, once he got there, the Democrats said, ""We can't ping-pong this back and forth between the Senate and the House. The House must pass the Senate bill, then we'll fix it in reconciliation."" "
217,"MR. MURPHY: That was a freight train of disingenuous sound bites, and I can't try to address them all. "
218,"MR. SHRUM: It was actually--it was, it was actually the march of truth. "
219,"MR. MURPHY: It was baloney. I worked on the Romney healthcare bill, you didn't. I know you don't. Here's my question for you. "
220,MR. SHRUM: I do know the Romney healthcare bill. He helped write it with Senator Kennedy. 
221,"MR. MURPHY: Here's my question for you, Bob. Based on this historical triumph of incredible dimensions, how many House and Senate seats you guys going to pick up in the midterm election? "
222,"MR. SHRUM: Oh, I don't think we'll pick up seats. We'll lose seats. But we'll lose far fewer seats than people assumed. I think the Republicans peaked way too early. "
223,"MR. MURPHY: Well, we'll see. "
224,"MR. SHRUM: And I think, Murphy, they made a big mistake. They didn't take your advice from months ago that they had to stand for something positive. "
225,MR. MURPHY: Well... 
226,"MR. SHRUM: The campaign you're running in California for governor stands for something positive. I hope it doesn't work, but... "
227,"MR. GREGORY: Let me ask specific question, though, that I brought up from the Brownstein piece, which is a lot of working-class, middle-class voters--and I showed this to Senator Schumer--they don't--they oppose this healthcare plan. "
228,MR. MURPHY: Right. 
229,"MR. GREGORY: The idea that somehow you think, ""Well, wait a minute, this is mostly helping people who are poor or don't have insurance. But, you know, I'm struggling here."" "
230,MR. MURPHY: Right. 
231,"MR. GREGORY: ""I may have insurance, but I'm struggling. Why are they getting all the benefits and not me?"" Is that a real sentiment that drives voters away from Democrats in the fall? "
232,"MR. MURPHY: No, absolutely. They feel totally disconnected--they thought they voted--Lindsey's right, for a middle-of-the-road person that would put Washington back together, and they got kind of a more liberal, more labor-oriented ideological administration and they've got that policy now. So they feel very disconnected from Washington, which is why the polls show Republicans are doing so well. "
233,"The only worry I have about the Republicans isn't now. I think we're going to do very well, because the country wants to get this out-of-control Congress back under control. I'm worried about the day after the election, because that's when we're going to have a lot of seats, despite the ""historic"" cry that Bob's very proud of here. And then the country's going to say, ""What are you going to do?"" And we'd better have a damn good answer at that moment. "
234,MR. SHRUM: And you don't right now. 
235,"MR. GREGORY: All right, I want to get to that in just a minute. "
236,"MR. MURPHY: Well, we do, but we're not, we're not talking about it right now. "
237,"MR. GREGORY: But, but let's stick with some of the nature of the opposition. Sarah Palin was--has gotten a lot of coverage. She was out this weekend campaigning for Senator McCain, who faces a tough race, a reminder that that anti-incumbency is also directed at Republicans like a Senator McCain. And she makes a point about the nexus between Republicans and the tea party movement out there. This is what she said. "
238,"(Videotape, Friday) "
239,"FMR. GOV. SARAH PALIN (R-AK): And let me clear the air right now. We might as well call it like we see it, right, and not beat around the bush. In respect to the tea party movement, beautiful movement. You know what, everybody here today supporting John McCain, we are all a part of that tea party movement. "
240,(End videotape) 
241,"MR. GREGORY: Is that true? That's probably what Republicans hope is true, that the tea party is part of the Republican Party. "
242,"MR. MEACHAM: I think perhaps that crowd, perhaps it was true there. "
243,MS. GOODWIN: In Searchlight. 
244,"MR. MEACHAM: In Searchlight. Well, no, that was a different one. But I don't think so. I think--and Bob and Michael know this better. But, you know, when you have these extreme, more for--vociferous and ferocious movements, it doesn't always help. As Churchill once said in another context, ""It's a good starter but it's not a good finisher."" And the way parties absorb these things--and we've seen it a thousand times; we've seen it with Wallace, we've seen it with Perot--is they take some part of the grievance, address it and press forward. I think we're--you know, partly we're built for argument. I mean, we--the system wasn't created to really resolve much, ultimately, to go back pre-Landon. "
245,"MS. GOODWIN: See, you're worse than me. You've gone way back. "
246,"MR. MEACHAM: Because, because we haven't mentioned James Madison yet. "
247,"MR. GREGORY: No, right. "
248,"MR. MEACHAM: And I think we, I think we'd be remiss not to. "
249,MR. SHRUM: And if you were in Texas you couldn't mention Jefferson... 
250,MR. MEACHAM: That's true. 
251,MR. SHRUM: ...because they've written him out of the curriculum. 
252,"MR. MEACHAM: That's true, that's true. "
253,"MR. GREGORY: Well, but, Doris--yeah, finish your point, Jon. "
254,"MR. MEACHAM: Well, just quickly. But honestly, I mean, when you think about it, and you think about the--it's interesting that the first question we asked is what's going to happen in the midterm? OK, all right. Well, we have this extraordinary bill, what's going to happen in the midterm? Well, this is the way it works. In 1964 we had civil rights, in 1965 we had Voting Rights Act. What happened in 1966? Republicans did extremely, extremely well. Ronald Reagan was elected governor of California. The system... "
255,"MS. GOODWIN: That was Vietnam as much as anything, though. "
256,"MR. MEACHAM: Well, it was... "
257,"MR. MURPHY: No, that point is correct. It's the big enchilada in 2012, which will also be linked to the one issue we're not talking about here, the economy, which is still the main driver of the election. "
258,MR. SHRUM: Right. 
259,MR. MEACHAM: Yeah. 
260,MS. GOODWIN: Of course. 
261,"MR. MURPHY: But you're right, the midterms are only a step along the way. I feel confident about that. But, beyond that, the Republican Party does have some work to do. "
262,"MR. GREGORY: Well, that--that's a question, Doris. What are the expectations that the American people have right now of government on the other end of the arduous process that has been health care? "
263,"MS. GOODWIN: Well, I think that's one of the things that needs to be worked on if public sentiment is going to be changed. Before the Obama campaign began, people were saying they trusted government more. It was one of those sea changes, a little bit, from the Reagan era of conservatives hating government. And now they're just so mad at the process that we have to be able, I think, if you are a Democrat, or even if you care about government, to show that government did come through in the end in a certain way. You know, the funny thing about the way this process worked, even though everybody said it was so horrible and he should have taken control earlier, the one thing LBJ always said was that they have to be with you on the takeoff if they're going to be with you on the landing. And he made Congress feel engaged in this process. Even though it seemed it went on much too long, by the end, boy, they were there with him on the landing. They got the credit, they got the recognition. I think my favorite moment at that moment was when that guy stood up, and he said, you know, ""You've taken your lumps."" ""We sure did, but we're still standing."" He's linked to them in a way. But now the--still, I couldn't agree more that the sentiment in the country has not yet been changed on this. And unless they do that, then I think the Democrats will be in trouble. "
264,"MR. SHRUM: There are two things, though, in the... "
265,MR. MURPHY: LBJ was... 
266,MR. SHRUM: Go ahead. 
267,"MR. MURPHY: ...a lot better at, at a bipartisan kind of strong-arming and compromise than President Obama was. He had the Democratic Party with him on the takeoff, he's got most of them on the landing, but he has nobody else. And it's hard to change the country with just that. "
268,"MR. SHRUM: Yeah, but, but, but, but wait, but wait a minute. Everett Dirksen, who was the Republican leader, was willing to help John Kennedy on the test ban treaty, was willing to help him on civil rights and help Lyndon Johnson. Mitch McConnell said from the beginning, ""We're not going to help at all. We're going to obstruct no matter what's in the bill"" before he knew what was in the bill. So I think you have a very different situation. The president did exactly what he has to do. "
269,"And by the way, Mike's right about the economy. The next big thing to watch for are the March job numbers which come out in early April. Show significant job creation. Start recalculating the midterm. "
270,MR. GREGORY: That's the last word. Thank you all very much. 
271,"Coming next, our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE. A look back at another piece of healthcare legislation that had congressional Republicans, including then minority leader Congressman Gerald Ford, and a question about repeal, after this brief station break. "
272,"MR. GREGORY: And we're back with our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE. Forty-five years ago in Washington there was another heated debate about providing health care to Americans. Despite vigorous Republican opposition, a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress passed sweeping reform. July 30th, 1965, the country's largest ever expansion of public health care, the Medicare program, was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson in Independence, Missouri, the hometown of President Harry Truman, who had fought for a national health insurance program 20 years prior. "
273,"A year later, Republicans made some big gains in the midterm election due in large part to President Johnson's unpopularity. The GOP netted 47 House seats. And in early 1967, then House Minority Leader Gerald Ford appeared right here on MEET THE PRESS to discuss his party's plans and the issue of whether Medicare should be repealed. "
274,"(Videotape January 8, 1967) "
275,"MR. NEIL MacNEIL: Mr. Ford, the last election is interpreted by many as a mandate for the House Republicans. In the previous Congress, you people describe that Congress as one of the worst. I'd like to know whether you plan to repeal or basically alter any of that worst legislation, for example the Medicare bill? "
276,"REP. GERALD R. FORD: In the last Congress, the Republicans, as you well know, recognized that there were problems domestically that had to be solved. We felt there were better ways for the Republicans to do this job than the way that the administration proposed. For example, we had an alternative, a constructive one in my judgment, for the handling of the problems of the aged, hospital care, medical care. We had other alternatives. We had a better voting rights bill, for example, than I think that which came from the White House. I still think it should be on the books. It would be better legislation than the one we're operating under at the present time. "
277,"Mr. MacNEIL: Well, well, isn't the House now a conservative body? "
278,"REP. FORD: I think the Republicans, the 187 of us, compared to 248 Democrats, is, the Republicans are a moderate, highly unanimous group of representatives, and we're not going to clobber things. We're not going to stop the progress of America. We're going to try to redirect it and do it in a more effective and, I think, less expensive way. "
279,(End videotape) 
280,"MR. GREGORY: The question today on healthcare reform, of course, is whether it represents progress for the American people. But, as a political reality, both parties understand very difficult to take away a benefit from the American people once it's been given. And we'll be right back. "
281,(Announcements) 
282,"MR. GREGORY: Before we go this morning, a programming note. Tune in Tuesday to NBC's ""Today"" program for Matt Lauer's exclusive interview with President Obama, his first one-on-one interview since signing healthcare reform into law. That is Tuesday morning. "
283,"That's all for today. We'll be back next week. If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS.  "

        MR. DAVID GREGORY: This Sunday, a bomb in New York's Times Square forces the
evacuation of thousands. What more is known this morning? And the latest on what damage the administration expects along the Gulf Coast from that massive oil spill. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, and the head of the U.S. Coast Guard, Admiral Thad Allen all will be here. 
    "
1,"Then the implications of the oil rig spill, a global immigration debate, and Iran's anti-American leader coming to America stirring controversy over nuclear weapons. Our exclusive guest, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton."
2,"And is the future of the GOP playing out in Florida? Republican Governor Charlie Crist joins
me to explain why he's running as an independent for the Senate.
Plus, our political roundtable weighs in, leaders from Congress and the states talking about the
president's agenda."
3,"Finally, MEET THE PRESS gets a new look."
4,"Announcer: From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory.
MR. GREGORY: Good morning. Breaking news this morning as police find and diffuse a car
bomb inside of an SUV in New York's Times Square last night."
5,(Videotape)
6,MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: We avoided what could have been a very deadly event...Certainly could have exploded and had a pretty big fire and a decent amount of explosive impact.
7,(End videotape)
8,"MR. GREGORY: Plus, the president flies to the Gulf Coast region this morning to assess the
response to that massive oil spill threatening the Louisiana and Mississippi coastlines. Here
with us to discuss these developing stories, the secretary of Homeland Security, Janet
Napolitano; the secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar; and with us from New Orleans, the man
spearheading the governmentwide operation, U.S. Coast Guard Commandant, Admiral Thad
Allen."
9,Welcome to all of you.
10,"Secretary Napolitano, let me start with you and this developing story out of New York. Mayor
Bloomberg described this as an ""amateurish device."" What does it say at this point about who's
behind it, in your judgment?"
11,"SEC'Y JANET NAPOLITANO: Well, we're taking it very seriously. It was obviously parked in an area, a lot of pedestrian traffic, other traffic. It's too soon to tell who was responsible, who or what groups were responsible, so every possible examination is being done of the device, but
also of the forensics. "
12,MR. GREGORY: An act of terrorism?
13,"SEC'Y NAPOLITANO: You know, it certainly looks that way. It certainly looks as if it was
intended to be that way."
14,"MR. GREGORY: Was it an indication at all of something wider, some kind of wider plot?
Can you determine that at this point?"
15,"SEC'Y NAPOLITANO: You know, at this point I have no information that it's anything other
than a one-off. But again, the situation is, is it happened. The forensics are being done. The
FBI and, and the Department of Homeland Security, along with the New York City Police,
working together to identify whether there are any other acts going on. We don't have any
information that there are right now."
16,"MR. GREGORY: This was a big device, though."
17,"SEC'Y NAPOLITANO: It was, it was a big device. I can't give you the--what would have been
the actually explosion had it actually detonated. That's all being worked up right now."
18,MR. GREGORY: What about leads? Where is the investigation going at the moment?
19,"SEC'Y NAPOLITANO: Well, every possible lead--you know, you look at the license plate on the vehicle, you look at the vehicle itself, you look at any sources on the, the propane tanks or anything else, you look for fingerprints. You look for all of kind of the traditional things..."
20,MR. GREGORY: Right.
21,"SEC'Y NAPOLITANO: ...people read, hear about, see on television. And then we also begin looking at, for example, videotape. There are a lot of cameras in that area of New York City."
22,"MR. GREGORY: Can you see anybody on the tape, or eyewitness accounts? "
23,"SEC'Y NAPOLITANO: Again, it's too soon to say. If there were already identification of a subject or subjects, obviously that would be getting out. But right now the investigation is just
beginning. "
24,"MR. GREGORY: All right. Let me turn to the other developing story, and that is, of course,
the oil spill. Let me go down to New Orleans and Admiral Allen. You're on the ground there, you're assessing the situation. I think the most obvious first question is how are they doing actually shutting off the leak itself? "
25,"ADM. THAD ALLEN: Well, David, that's the most challenging part of this operation. We're dealing with a wellhead that's 5,000 feet down on the sea floor, and a well that extends 18,000 feet below it. We've got a 5,000-foot riser pipe that came from the wellhead up to the drilling vessel that's crumpled on the ocean, and we have three different areas where there is product leaking from that pipe. All the work has to be done with remotely operated vehicles. There are a number of, of different scenarios that are being planned out by BP right now. All of it has to be done with remotely operated vehicles. But everything is, is being done because it looks like we had a failure of the blowout preventer, which is a device thats above the well, that is supposed to close it down in, in times of emergency that appeared not to work this time. "
26,"MR. GREGORY: And that is a big question, right? How, how does that not happen? How
does a fail-safe procedure fail?"
27,"ADM. ALLEN: Well, I would defer to Secretary Salazar for follow on comment, but basically
it's a multistage device that sits above the wellhead that can either cut the pipe, crimp the pipe, or put a rubber seal around it. So there are fair--various levels that can be actuated, but it appeared that it only partially actuated or did not actuate."
28,MR. GREGORY: Secretary...
29,ADM. ALLEN: But I would defer to Secretary Salazar.
30,"MR. GREGORY: All right. Well, Secretary Salazar, before you address that, I think another important issue here is how bad is it going to be? When is this going to reach shore and how
bad will it be when it gets here, this oil spill?"
31,"SEC'Y KEN SALAZAR: You know, from day one we've been preparing for the worst-case
scenario. There's a spill plan that essentially would cover hundreds of thousands of barrels of
oil, and that spill--response plan is what is being activated. You know, I have flown over this
area many times, and we have some of the most wonderful wildlife refuges and national parks.
The Gulf Coast is a place that needs to be protected. The president has directed from day one
that we spare nothing at all in terms of the effort to prevent damage onshore as well as taking
whatever other actions taking place."
32,"MR. GREGORY: But paint the scenario. I mean, you've got commercial fishery down there,
you've got small towns whose livelihood depend on commercial fishing. If that's interrupted or
lost for a period of time, those are jobs that could never come back, those are industries that
could never come back. What's a scenario of what you think you could actually be looking at in
terms of environmental impact?"
33,"SEC'Y SALAZAR: The, the scenario is a very grave scenario. You're looking at potentially 90
days before you ultimately get to what is the ultimate solution here, and that's a relief well that's going to have to be drilled down three and a half miles below the ocean floor. And by the time you drill that well down, a lot of oil could spread. Now, as that oil spreads, what the president has directed us to do is to make sure that we're taking care of protecting all of the assets down there, and that includes the communities, the people who are going to be affected by it. And so, at the end of the day, this is the beginning of a campaign for, for what's going to be a massive restoration of the Gulf Coast. "
34,"MR. GREGORY: In terms of environmental impact, bigger in scale than the results of the
Exxon Valdez spill? "
35,"SEC'Y SALAZAR: It is unknown at this point. We're in a dynamic situation. Everything is being tried to stop the source. And that's where the global resources are, are, are focused, on that particular challenge, but they're also focused on all the other aspects that the, the commandant was talking about. "
36,"MR. GREGORY: Secretary Napolitano, there are questions about when the government acted,
whether it did everything it could at the right moment. Is the government playing catch-up
here? You yourself didn't even request, until late in the week, for additional DOD resources to
be brought to bear. Is this a, a situation of playing catch-up?"
37,"SEC'Y NAPOLITANO: No, not at all. We had DOD resources there from day one. This was a
situation that was treated as a possible catastrophic failure from, from day one. So we had
prepositioned in place hundreds of thousands of feet of boom. There were 73 vessels, now over a hundred ships there to work on preventing the oil from actually reaching the shore, to, to stage that fight offshore, as it were. Every possible resource was being lined up onshore. There were set up joint command centers that included not only the Department of Interior, but other federal agencies and the states who are important participants in this. And so the physical response on the ground has been, from, from day one, as if this could be a catastrophic failure. "
38,As the situation has evolved...
39,MR. GREGORY: But did the government...
40,SEC'Y NAPOLITANO: ...different administrative actions then get taken.
41,"MR. GREGORY: Was the, was the government misled by BP? Could the government have done more to make an assessment that things were spiraling out of control more quickly?"
42,"SEC'Y NAPOLITANO: No. We had independent projections being done at the beginning. And realize, this incident evolved over time. First it was an explosion; and, of course, the Coast
Guard was first on scene with the search and rescue. Then two days later the, the, the rig
actually sank. And then you had some oil coming to the surface, but it was being burned off.
And then you had some oil starting to spread. All the while, BP is down there trying to deploy
its remote operating vessels, its robots, basically, down as deep as Ken just said, to try to shut off this oil to fix the riser. So all, all the time we are saying--getting independent verification of what was actually bubbling to the surface. And now, of course, we see a large slick and, of course, that evolved over the end of the week. "
43,MR. GREGORY: You're disappointed in BP's actions so far this week?
44,"SEC'Y NAPOLITANO: Well, I think we're all disappointed that BP hasn't been able to shut off
this well. And I would add to what Secretary Salazar said, all of these actions are being taken, but BP is going to pay for them."
45,"MR. GREGORY: Before I let you all go, question about Arizona. You're a former U.S.
attorney from the northern part of the state, former governor, of course. Will this very tough
law against illegal immigrants stand as a legal matter?"
46,"SEC'Y NAPOLITANO: Well, I'll, I'll tell you what. The Justice Department is looking at the
constitutionality of the provision. But I will tell you as the former U.S. attorney, attorney
general, and, and governor, I vetoed similar laws in part because they were bad for law
enforcement. I think what Arizonans are saying is that ""we need comprehensive immigration
reform, and our, our state simply can't afford to keep waiting."""
47,"MR. GREGORY: As a law enforcement officer, do you think this invites racial profiling that
will hurt the state?"
48,"SEC'Y NAPOLITANO: I think it certainly could invite profiling. And, and, again, you know,
as an Arizonan I think this law is the wrong way to go."
49,"MR. GREGORY: All right. We will leave it there. Thanks to all of you for being here this
busy morning. Earlier this weekend, we discussed some of the broader implications of this Gulf Coast oil spill, plus the immigration debate, and other global hotspots in an exclusive conversation with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton."
50,(Videotape)
51,MR. GREGORY: Welcome back. Thanks for being here.
52,"SEC'Y HILLARY CLINTON: Well, David, I'm thrilled to be here on the new set. Thank you."
53,MR. GREGORY: Thank you very much. There's a lot of important issues to talk about.
54,SEC'Y CLINTON: Yes.
55,"MR. GREGORY: What's certainly in the headlines this weekend is this oil spill off the coast of
Louisiana and Mississippi, and it becomes a bigger issue and even a national security issue in--
as it applies to climate change, which is an issue that you've dealt with. How will the
administration approach this, particularly given the president's interests in offshore drilling?
Does that have to stop now?"
56,"SEC'Y CLINTON: Well, David, I think that the president has ordered the departments that deal
with this, Homeland Security, Interior, Environmental Protection, Defense to all immediately,
not only do everything possible to mitigate the effects of this spill, but to try to come up with recommendations going forward. First order of business, however, is to try to get this spill under control--which has been, as you know, very difficult--and to prevent further damage to
the coastline along Louisiana to the fishing waters, to the wildlife. I think it does raise questions, which the president has said have to be answered. He put forth a very comprehensive approach that included the potential of drilling off of our own shore. That is a
national security concern because we have to do better to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. But it has to be done safely. It can't be done at the risk of having to spend billions of dollars cleaning up these spills. So, as with so much in these difficult areas, it's going to require a balancing act."
57,"MR. GREGORY: Another area that has become a domestic political debate over immigration
has also taken on some international ramifications. Mexico, because of the law, the stringent
law against--anti-immigration law passed in Arizona has issued a pretty unusual alert..."
58,SEC'Y CLINTON: Mm-hmm.
59,"MR. GREGORY: ...to its own citizens traveling to Arizona. I'll put it up on the screen. This is
the alert, a travel alert over Arizona immigration law. This is how the USA Today reported it on
Wednesday. ""The country warned that the state's adoption of a strict immigration enforcement
law has created `a negative political environment for migrant communities and for all Mexican
visitors.'"
60,"""`It must be assumed that every Mexican citizen may be harassed and questioned without
further cause at any time,' according to the foreign ministry."" The president, President Calderon, with whom you'll meet soon has talked about criminalizing--""this law criminalizes a largely social and economic phenomenon of migration."" This is a pretty big shot across the bow to America here."
61,"SEC'Y CLINTON: Well, it is, and, and I think if you look at it, again, you have a lot of
unanswered questions. This law, which is clearly a result of the frustration that people in
Arizona and their elected officials feel about the difficulty of enforcing the law along our border
and preventing the continued immigration, people who are not documented. But on the other
hand, it is written so broadly that if you were visiting in Arizona and you had an accent and you were a citizen from, you know, my state, of New York, you could be subjected to the kind of inquiry that is call--that this law permits. "
62,"MR. GREGORY: You think it invites profiling, racial profiling?"
63,"SEC'Y CLINTON: I don't think there's any doubt about that because, clearly, as I understand
the way the law is being explained, if you're a legal resident, you still have to carry papers.
Well, how are--how is a law enforcement official supposed to know? So, again, we have to try
to balance the very legitimate concerns that Americans--not just people in Arizona, but across
the country--have about safe and secure borders, about trying to have comprehensive
immigration reform, with a law that I think does what a state doesn't have the authority to do,
try to impose their own immigration law that is really the province of the federal government."
64,MR. GREGORY: That's important. Do you think this law will not stand up legally?
65,"SEC'Y CLINTON: Well, I don't want to offer a legal opinion. I, I think I'll leave that to the
Justice Department, but I know the attorney general of Arizona has raised questions about the
legality. And you're right, we have a visit from President Calderon coming up, a state visit.
He's a very important partner to us on trying to stop illegal activity along our border--the
importation of drugs, of arms, of human beings, all of the crime that that's associated with--and we believe that he has really done the best he can under very difficult circumstances to get this under control. We don't want to make his life any harder either. We want to try to support him in what has been a courageous campaign against the drug traffickers. "
66,"MR. GREGORY: Let me move on to some other issues that are obviously on your plate, which
is a, a big plate of issues."
67,SEC'Y CLINTON: Yes.
68,"MR. GREGORY: Let's talk about Afghanistan. A big offensive is being planned for Kandahar,
a very important visit by President Karzai is coming up after a period of turbulence between the
U.S. and Karzai, which I know the administration has tried to tamp down. And yet, it's the
nature of the insurgency that our fighting men and women are dealing with, and the Pentagon
issued a report that was reported on by the Los Angeles Times on Thursday. Let me put it up on the screen. It says, the report presented a sobering new assessment Wednesday of the Talibanled insurgency in the country, saying that its abilities are expanding and its operations are increasing in sophistication, despite major offensives by U.S. forces in the militants' heartland,"" like Marja. ""The new report offers a grim take on the likely difficulty of establishing lasting security, especially in southern Afghanistan, where the insurgency enjoys broad support. The conclusions raise the prospect that the insurgency in the south may never be completely vanquished, but instead must be contained to prevent it from threatening the government of the President Harmid Karzai."" A narrow question here. Are you resigned to the fact that the Taliban, the insurgency, will have to be a part of this government in the future?"
69,"SEC'Y CLINTON: No. And let me start by putting the, the recent report from the Pentagon
into context. It was a look back. It goes from last October through March. When we were
devising the strategy that the president announced at West Point in early December, it was
during the August, September, October, November period. And there was no doubt that the
Taliban had the initiative, that there was a very serious threat to not only our forces, obviously, on the ground, but to the stability and security of Afghanistan."
70,"MR. GREGORY: But you hear all this talk, and Karzai wants some kind of reconciliation with
the Taliban as well."
71,"SEC'Y CLINTON: Well, but, David, I think that we have to sort of sort out what we mean by
that. We talk about reconciliation and reintegration. They may sound the same, but they're
somewhat different concepts. Reintegration refers to the foot soldiers on the field who are
coming in increasing numbers and saying, ""Look, you know, we're fighting because we get paid.
We're fighting because we were volunteered to fight because the Taliban came to our village
and intimidated our, our, our elders. So there, there seems to be an ongoing movement of
people sort of out of the battlefield. And General McChrystal and his commanders on the
ground are seeing that and kind of organizing and running that."
72,"The larger question about reconciliation--I don't know any conflict in recent times that didn't
have some political resolution associated with it. People either got tired of fighting and decided
they would engage in a peace process, they were defeated enough so that they were willing to lay down their arms. What President Karzai is saying, and we agree with this direction, is that you've got to look to see who is reconcilable. Not everybody will be. We don't expect Mullah Omar to show up and say, ""Oh yeah, I'm giving up on my association with al-Qaeda, etc."" But we do think that there are leaders within the Taliban--in fact, there are some already who have come over to the other side. Now, if they do so, they have to renounce al-Qaeda, they have to renounce violence, they have to give up their arms, and they have to be willing to abide by the Afghan constitution."
73,"MR. GREGORY: Another adversary, of course, gets us to Iran and the fact that President
Ahmadinejad from Iran will be coming to New York to the U.N. for a nonproliferation meeting."
74,SEC'Y CLINTON: Right.
75,"MR. GREGORY: You're moving down a path of sanctions, we understand what that is. Do
you feel like he's going to try to show up here the early part of next week and steal the show?"
76,"SEC'Y CLINTON: I don't know what he's showing up for because the purpose of the nonproliferation treaty review conference is to reiterate the commitment of the international
community to the three goals--disarmament, non-proliferation, the peaceful uses of nuclear
energy. So the vast majority of countries are coming to see what progress we can make. And
this is a very high priority for President Obama. It's why he pressed so hard for the START
treaty, which he signed with President Medvedev in Prague. It's why he convened the nuclear
security summit to highlight the threat posed by nuclear terrorism. It's why we have begun to
work out deals with India and others for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, which countries are entitled to under the non-proliferation regime. If Iran is coming to say, ""We're willing to abide by the non-proliferation treaty,"" that would be very welcome news. I have a feeling that's not what they're coming to do. I think they're coming to try to divert attention and confuse the issue. And there is no confusion. They have violated the terms of the NPT, they have been held under all kinds of restrictions and obligations that they have not complied with by the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, by the U.N. Security Council. So we're not going to permit Iran to try to change the, the story from their failure to comply and in any way upset the efforts we are in the midst of, which is to get the international community to adopt a strong Security Council resolution that further isolates them and imposes consequences for their behavior."
77,"MR. GREGORY: Madam Secretary, I'd like to spend a couple minutes on some other global
hot spots that you're dealing with. The first one is actually with America's strong ally in the
U.K., in Great Britain. Very interesting election going on. You've got three candidates, a
resurgent third party in the Social Democrats, televised debates. You know something about
those."
78,SEC'Y CLINTON: I do.
79,"MR. GREGORY: And as you watch what's going on there, do you think there's a movement
that could spread? Do you see a third party becoming viable in the United States?"
80,"SEC'Y CLINTON: Well, let's see whether it's viable in the U.K. I, I don't know the answer to
that. Weve had, in my lifetime, and certainly long before, viable third party candidates. We've,
you know, had Ross Perot, John Anderson, you know, just within my voting history. I think
there's always room in a democracy for people to bring their views to the forefront. But I think
one of the real strengths of our system has been our two-party approach, where each party may frustrate some of its own members because they, they do have a broad cross-section of voters and opinions. But, look, I'm going to be as interested in anybody in seeing what happens in the election in Great Britain."
81,"MR. GREGORY: Final one has to do with the election in Sudan, where you have Bashir as the
victor. And yet, this is--Sudan is a sponsor of state terror, according to the State Department.
And this is someone who's boasting about the results and keeping the United States at bay.
Nicholas Kristof wrote this in The New York Times: ""Until he reached the White House,""
President ""Obama repeatedly insisted"" the U.S. ""apply more pressure on Sudan so as to avoid a
humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur and elsewhere. Yet, as president, Mr. Obama and his aides
have caved, leaving Sudan gloating at American weakness. ...""President"" Bashir, ""al-Bashir of Sudan - the man wanted"" ... ""for crimes against humanity in Darfur - has been celebrating. His regime calls itself the National Congress Party, or N.C.P., and he was quoted in Sudan as telling a rally in the Blue Nile region:"" Every America--""`Even America is becoming an N.C.P. member. No one is against our will.' ""Memo to Mr. Obama: When a man who has been charged with crimes against humanity tells the world that America is in his pocket, it's time to review your policy."" What do you say? "
82,"SEC'Y CLINTON: Well, I would say that, number one, I, I can't take anything seriously that
Bashir says. He is an indicted war criminal. The United States is very committed to seeing him
brought to justice. But let's look at what's happening in Sudan, because I have the greatest
respect, of course, for Nick Kristof and others who share my deep dismay at events in Sudan.
But here's what we're trying to do. When we came into office, Bashir threw out the, the groups, the non-governmental organizations who were providing most of the aid in the camps in Darfur, which could have been a disastrous humanitarian crisis. We were able to get a lot of the help back in, and we're beginning to see some slight progress in Darfur. I don't want to overstate it because it is still a deplorable situation. But we're working to try to get the people back to their homes, out of the camps. At the same time, you had this election going on. It was, by any measure, a flawed election. There were many, many things wrong with it, but there hadn't been an election in many years. And so part of our goal was to try to empower opposition parties, empower people to go out and vote. Thousands and thousands did. The result, I think, was pretty much foreordained that Bashir would come out the winner, and that's unfortunate. We are turning all of our attention to trying to help the south and to mitigate against the attitudes of the north. I, I can't sit here and say that we are satisfied because I'm certainly not satisfied with where we are and what we're doing, but it is an immensely complicated arena. Now, the United States could back off and say, ""We won't deal with these people, we're not going to have anything to do with them, Bashir is a war criminal."" I don't think that will improve the situation. So along with our partners--the U.K., Norway, neighboring countries-- we are trying to manage what is a very explosive problem. "
83,"MR. GREGORY: Just a couple minutes left. I want to ask you about another big thrust of your
time as secretary of State, and that is forging--well, I should say, a realization that there are
limits to what government can accomplish around the world."
84,SEC'Y CLINTON: Mm-hmm.
85,MR. GREGORY: You have spent a lot of time working with the private sector...
86,SEC'Y CLINTON: Mm-hmm.
87,"MR. GREGORY: ...to achieve certain commercial goals, also to achieve goals like the
empowerment of women. You've got an announcement this, this weekend having to do with
the China Expo..."
88,SEC'Y CLINTON: Right.
89,"MR. GREGORY: ...and the U.S. role in the China Expo, as well as efforts to empower women
around the world in developing countries through the help of the private sector. Why is this
really the, the route of the future for the government?"
90,"SEC'Y CLINTON: Thank you for asking me that because that is exactly what I believe, that
diplomacy today is not just government to government. Part of what I had to do when I became secretary of State was to rebuild America's image, standing, and leadership in the world; and certainly President Obama is, you know, our greatest advocate of that. But you can't just do that by the government saying things or even by our president making incredibly important speeches. You have to begin to engage the people in other countries; and, in order to do that effectively, I want more people to people contacts, I want more private sector partnerships with our public sector and with people around the world."
91,"Let me give you two quick examples. You mentioned the Shanghai Expo. You know, there are
probably 70 million plus people who go through that Expo. When I became secretary of State,
there was no money raised because we don't put public money into a project like that. So with
the help of a lot of very dedicated corporate sponsors, we now will be a player in that Expo.
Now, what does that mean? Well, when those 70 million Chinese, mostly Chinese, but people
from elsewhere in the world, go through, they're going to learn something about America. They're going to learn something about, you know, our values, about our products, about, you
know, how we live. I think that helps to build the kind of understanding and connection that is
at the root of good relations."
92,"And on women's issues, we just had a great announcement through the combined efforts of a
number of corporate sponsors, foundations like the Rockefeller Foundation. We're going to be
working to help empower women doing what they do best and to try to up their education
levels, their health levels. Why does this matter? Because it's the United States doing it. And
it's not just the United States government, it's the people of the United States."
93,"MR. GREGORY: Before you go, a question about whether you think it's realistic that you will
stay on as secretary of State for the balance of the first term."
94,"SEC'Y CLINTON: Well, I intend to, yeah."
95,MR. GREGORY: You do intend to?
96,"SEC'Y CLINTON: I intend to, yeah. But, I mean, you know, people have been asking me this
and in, in the interest of full disclosure, it is an exhausting job. But I enjoy it, I have a great
time doing it. I feel like we're making a difference around the world, that--you know, I'm a big
believer in setting goals, having a vision of where we're trying to get, but then trying to translate that into what we do today and what we do tomorrow. And we've made a lot of progress. We face incredibly difficult problems. "
97,"MR. GREGORY: But so, you, you think you'll stay for the whole first term?"
98,"SEC'Y CLINTON: Well, I think so. I think so. I mean, look, you know, ask me next month
and the month after that. But that certainly is my intention."
99,MR. GREGORY: And yet you don't care to be on the Supreme Court?
100,"SEC'Y CLINTON: Oh, never. I mean, I'm glad, I'm glad you asked me that."
101,MR. GREGORY: You're a lawyer with all that background.
102,"SEC'Y CLINTON: I am--I do not and have never wanted to be a judge, ever. I mean, that has
never been anything that I even let cross my mind because it's just not my personality.\"
103,MR. GREGORY: Do you think the president should pick another women--woman this time?
104,"SEC'Y CLINTON: I think he should pick a very well-qualified, people-savvy, young person to
be on the Court to really help to shape the jurisprudence going forward. I think that, you know,
it's not a surprise that there's a real division on the Court, and a lot of decisions that have great ramifications for the people of our country, that I would like to see someone put on the Court who can really try to shift the direction of the current Court."
105,"MR. GREGORY: Secretary Clinton, thank you, as always."
106,SEC'Y CLINTON: You're welcome.
107,"MR. GREGORY: And up next, an exclusive interview with Florida's Republican governor,
Charlie Crist. Why he's now running as an independent for Senate and what it means about the
future of the GOP. Plus, a look at how the president's agenda is playing out across the country."
108,"Our political roundtable of leaders from Congress and the states weighs in, only here on MEET THE PRESS."
109,(Announcements)
110,"MR. GREGORY: Florida Governor Charlie Crist on his decision to leave the Republican Party
and run for the Senate as an independent. Plus, our political roundtable with state and
congressional leaders. They tackle the politics of immigration and much more, right after this
brief commercial break."
111,(Announcements)
112,"MR. GREGORY: And we are back. Joining us now, Governor Charlie Crist of Florida, who
announced this week he is leaving the Republican Party and is now running for the U.S. Senate
as an independent."
113,"Governor, good morning."
114,"GOV. CHARLIE CRIST (FL): Good morning, David. How are you?"
115,"MR. GREGORY: Just 35 days ago, during an interview on Fox News, you were categorical
about this. The question was, ""Are you willing to pledge right here, right now that you will run
in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate and not run as an independent?"" Your response:
""I'm running as a Republican."" Did you determine in those 35 days that the Republican Party
had rejected you?"
116,"GOV. CRIST: I think the primary part of the Republican Party. The, the primary Republicans,
if you will. And what ensued in those 35 days was a lot of listening on my part, David. The
next weekend was Easter weekend. My wife, Carole, and I went down to Useppa Island and had the opportunity to start listening to people around the state, whether in southwest Florida or in Miami or Jacksonville or my home of St. Petersburg, or in the Panhandle where I am today.
And the consistent message that I got over and over and over again was that people were
frustrated, they were tired of the gridlock, tired of the bickering in Washington, D.C., and that
we needed a new way, a better path, if you will, and encouraged me to run independent and get to that November ballot so that the people of Florida, all the people of Florida, would have a much truer choice when it came to this race for the U.S. Senate. "
117,"MR. GREGORY: But, Governor, you were elected as a Republican. The Republicans of
Florida know you best. And here is your standing in the polls, you're now some 20 points
behind Marco Rubio. What a change from back in October, when you had a pretty
commanding lead over him. You say listen to the people. Have the people not spoken?"
118,"GOV. CRIST: Well, in a sense they have. But again, I would, I would emphasize that those are
primary Republican voters. It's very different from the November Republican or Democrats or
independents. And I think what's happening in our country is unfortunately there's a lot of
primary fear. And what I mean by that is, you know, I see people in Washington in the House
or the Senate and they're so concerned about being faced or challenged in a primary that they
can't speak their, their true sense, their, their free will. They feel, feel kind of shackled, if you
will, by what the primary voters might do. And I think what we need to have is a true, honest
discussion about what democracy is supposed to be about. Let all the people have their say..."
119,MR. GREGORY: All right.
120,"GOV. CRIST: ...give them a true choice, and that's why I'm going to November."
121,"MR. GREGORY: I was struck in an interview on Friday, you, you made a point by saying
you're not deserting the Republican Party. And if we can, rather quickly, I just want to go a few issues to really sort of explore where you are. If you are elected as a senator, will you caucus in the Senate with Republicans?"
122,"GOV. CRIST: I'll caucus with the people of Florida. And, and, and as I said earlier this week,
I'll caucus with anybody who will help my fellow Floridians."
123,"MR. GREGORY: But hold on, Governor. You have to make a choice when you're in the
Senate, Republicans or Democrats. Who do you caucus with? As a matter of business, you'd
have to decide."
124,"GOV. CRIST: Well, when I'm an independent, I'm going to do what I think is in the best
interest of my people, and that's my decision. And that's what I'm going to do for Floridians.
And that's what people want. They don't want you to say, look, you have to either go with
Democrats or Republicans. You have to go with your gut and with your heart. That's what this
country needs now more than ever, and that's why I'm running independent."
125,"MR. GREGORY: Would you, would you vote for a Republican or a Democratic majority
leader?"
126,"GOV. CRIST: I might not vote for either one. You know, I'm going to vote for who I think
would be best for the people of Florida. And if that happens to be a Democrat, so be it. If it
happens to be a Republican, so be it. But I got to look out for the people of my state. I mean,
we've got candidates now in this race, one that's on the hard right in Speaker Rubio, one that's on the hard left in Congressman Meek; you know, sort of the big government guy and the big corporate guy. And then you've got a commonsense guy right down the middle that wants to represent the people of the state and do what's right. It's not right vs. left, this is about right vs. wrong."
127,"MR. GREGORY: All right, couple more issues. Would you support legislation that repealed
the president's healthcare legislation?"
128,"GOV. CRIST: Yeah, I think we need to start over. I really do. We've got a great plan here in
Florida, David. There's no government mandate, no tax increases. It offers coverage to those
who can't afford it, who have lost a job. It's a compassionate way to do it, and I think that's a
good model for the country."
129,MR. GREGORY: All right. Do you think you we need a limit on emissions of carbon dioxide?
130,"GOV. CRIST: I think we do have to have limits. I mean, you know, look what's happening
here in the Panhandle of Florida. On Tuesday I went out, I flew over this oil spill. It is horrific.
And it, and it terrifies me what the possible implications could be, both environmentally and
economically. If this doesn't make the case that we've got to go to clean energy--solar energy, wind energy, nuclear--I don't know what does. And, and I think that we have to be focused on that and realistic about it and move forward. "
131,"MR. GREGORY: Final question, Governor. Especially with the oil spill that has unfolded on
the Gulf Coast, is it your view that offshore drilling should be tabled as an idea going forward?"
132,"GOV. CRIST: Absolutely. It's got to be tabled for sure. I mean, you know, when I flew over it
on Tuesday and I saw the magnitude of this thing, it was, it was unbelievable. And then I've
been here in Pensacola yesterday and again today, and it, it frightens me. I mean, you know, I
think what we have to do is be prepared to handle this thing, do the very best we can, but we've got to be prepared for the worst. And that means going to clean energy as quickly as we can, and natural gas. "
133,"MR. GREGORY: Final point, Governor, before I let you go. Would you concede that you are
running an uphill battle as an independent for the Senate?"
134,"GOV. CRIST: I don't think there's any question about it. But I, but I do get great
encouragement. At the announcement in St. Petersburg, for example, on Thursday, after I said
I'm going to run as an independent, I said, ""I don't have either party anymore. I need the
people."" And some teachers were there behind me and said, ""Governor, we've got your back.""
That really inspired me. And while it's an uphill battle, I'm encouraged."
135,"MR. GREGORY: Governor Crist, thank you very much for joining us this morning."
136,And now...
137,"GOV. CRIST: Great. Thank you, David. Good to be with you."
138,"I want to bring in our political roundtable. Joining us, the Democrat governor of Michigan,
Jennifer Granholm; chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, Senator Lamar Alexander;
chairman of the House Republican Conference, Representative Mike Pence; and the Democratic
governor of New Mexico, Bill Richardson."
139,"First of all, welcome to our new digs. Very nice..."
140,REP. MIKE PENCE (R-IN): Thank you.
141,SEN. LAMAR ALEXANDER (R-TN): It's very nice.
142,GOV. JENNIFER GRANHOLM (D-MI): Beautiful.
143,"MR. GREGORY: ...to have all of you here. Thank you very much. We've had a lot of
breaking news here, so--and still a lot of issues to get to. We'll get to as much as we can on a
busy Sunday morning. I do want to start with politics.
Senator Alexander, you didn't get a commitment from the governor of Florida, who's now a
Republican, to caucus with Republicans. And the leadership, of which you're a part, has said,
""Thanks but no thanks."" You don't want much association with Governor Crist at the moment."
144,"SEN. ALEXANDER: Well, when he changed his mind, I changed my mind
about him. I'm very disappointed by that. I mean, it really undermines the ability of people to
participate in our, our, our politics. We've got a lot of alienated people in America right now.
They want a place to have their say. So we say, ""Come on in to our primary if you want to put a check and a balance on runaway government."" So he did, and now he says, ""I'm not doing so
well by the rules, so I'm going to go another direction."" That's what primaries are for."
145,"MR. GREGORY: But why--you know, when Senator Lieberman ran as an independent, the
Democratic Party did not push him away. They said, ""No, we're still, still--stay with us here.""
And yet the Republican leadership has said, ""No thanks, Governor."" You know, ""We've
changed our mind about you,"" as you just said. Is that a right strategy?"
146,"SEN. ALEXANDER: Senator Lieberman was different. First, he ran as an independent at the
same time he was running as a Democrat. Second, he had a very strong principled opposition to the Iraq war. And third, the Democratic leadership in that case said that they didn't, they didn't support him. So Marco Rubio has shown to the people of Florida that he's a better candidate than Governor Crist, apparently, and Governor Crist has said, ""I'm not doing too well by these rules. I think I'll try some other rules."""
147,"MR. GREGORY: On the other side of the aisle, Governor Richardson, from the Rocky
Mountain West and New Mexico, a place where independents have certainly flexed their
muscles, what's going on here from your vantage point? This was somebody, Governor Crist,
who was on the short list to be a vice presidential candidate for John McCain, and now he may
not survive within his own party?"
148,"GOV. BILL RICHARDSON (D-NM): Well, I think the case is, with the exception of our two
Republican guests who I know are moderate, this is a Republican Party that is basically driving
moderates like Charlie Crist out of the party. I mean, these--this was like an ideological litmus
test, and there is a dramatic increase in independent voters throughout the country. I think as an outsider, the true outsider in this race, Governor Crist, has a chance. But I want to say that we have some very strong Democratic candidates, and I believe that the entrance of Governor Crist has helped candidates like Congressman Meech--Meek, who has been very active, crisscrossing the state. But he certainly, Governor Crist, has, has turned the tables around in Florida. It's a wide open race."
149,"MR. GREGORY: But Congressman Pence, the bigger question is, is it safe to be a moderate in
the Republican Party? Or no longer?"
150,"REP. PENCE: Well, David, I'm still trying to recover being called a moderate by
Governor Richardson."
151,MR. GREGORY: Yeah.
152,"REP. PENCE: You know, I'm a, I'm a conservative."
153,MR. GREGORY: Something tells me he didn't really mean that.
154,"REP. PENCE: Yeah, I..."
155,GOV. RICHARDSON: I was trying to be nice to you.
156,"REP. PENCE: Yeah, yeah, it was nice. I endorsed Marco Rubio in February. I think the real
story here is that Marco Rubio won the primary early. I mean, he, he, he launched a campaign,
a come-from-behind campaign that was really built on what is a broad American rejection of the borrowing, the spending, the bailouts, and the takeovers of this administration. It was really born of the famous hug, that appeared as Republicans were fighting against or to call..."
157,"MR. GREGORY: His--the, the stimulus plan."
158,"REP. PENCE: Yeah. The so-called stimulus bill that has taken us from 7.5 percent employment to nearly 10 percent unemployment nationwide; worse in Michigan. I mean, I mean, Governor Crist, different from Republicans in Washington, D.C., decided to embrace the president's policies, literally embrace the president. Marco Rubio courageously stepped forward. He gave Republican voters in Florida a choice for a principled conservative committed to fiscal  responsibility and the principles of growth and conservative values, and he won that primary without anybody having to cast a vote."
159,"MR. GREGORY: All right. I want to move on. Governor Granholm, I want to talk about some of the other issues that we've been talking about this morning. This oil spill in the Gulf and questions of presidential leadership, the administration's role, you now have an oil spill the dimensions of which are not exactly clear. What kind of job has the administration done here dealing with the private company in BP, assessing the magnitude of damage here, and then responding? "
160,"GOV. GRANHOLM: Well, clearly, you had Janet Napolitano and Ken
Salazar on this morning. They outlined the steps that the administration is taking. This is
something I think that nobody could have anticipated or knew exactly what the scope was going to be. So they acted very swiftly to contain it. But I do think, to the bigger issue, it--and I'd be curious to know what this does in terms of the support for offshore drilling from the
Republicans who are on the panel here. I mean, I think that according to Governor Crist, we
should pause on that. But it does speak to the need to have an energy plan and policy that gets us to being independent of foreign oil, but also we should be careful about what sources of fossil fuels we're going after. "
161,"MR. GREGORY: Well, senator and the former secretary of energy is here as well. But,
Senator, this was the Tampa Tribune editorial on Monday on this point: ""The tragic explosion
of a drilling rig off the coast of Louisiana exposes the big lie espoused by the oil industry and its minions in the Florida Legislature: Modern drilling is harmless. ...""Americans have to accept some tradeoffs if we want an abundant and affordable energy. But we must balance the risks intelligently. ""To permit drilling in Florida's coastal waters where there is no margin for error is unnecessary and irresponsible."" This has to be seen as a setback for offshore drilling."
162,"SEN. ALEXANDER: It is a setback, and we ought to stop for a moment and see if there's
anything we can do to make it safer. All 40 Republican senators, now 41, support electrifying
half our cars and trucks, the best way to reduce the use of oil. If we were to do that, we'd
probably take 20 years and we'd still need 12 million barrels of oil a day in this country. And
one-fourth of all the air--oil that we produce for ourselves comes from the Gulf of Mexico. So,
unless we want $14 a gallon gasoline and tankers bringing oil from Saudi Arabia, which has
been 99 percent of the oil spills in history, we're going to have to find a way to continue to drill
safely in the Gulf of Mexico."
163,MR. GREGORY: Governor?
164,"GOV. RICHARDSON: Well, my view is that we need an overall oceans policy in this country
protecting the ocean just as we protect the land. I think the president was right in putting a
moratorium on new offshore leases. I think the Clean Water Act has to be expanded to provide
aid to the Gulf. I believe BP is to blame. They have to pay for this. This is something that,
obviously, they saw coming. They predicted wrongly. And the administration, I believe,
moved in rapidly. But, but I think across the board, David, we have to look at protecting our
fisheries, our coastal seabed, our seashores, and this means a national, a national policy on
oceans that we don't have."
165,"MR. GREGORY: Let me spend our last few minutes talking about the domestic debate over
immigration reform. This is a debate that is very, very serious, the Arizona law. It is also
something that the president used for some pretty sharp-edged satire, as well, at our annual
correspondents dinner here in Washington, the White House Correspondents Dinner, where he
talked about Senator McCain, who is actually supporting this measure after, you know,
spearheading comprehensive immigration reform with the late Senator Kennedy. Here was the
president last night."
166,(Videotape)
167,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA: Unfortunately, John McCain couldn't make it. Recently he
claimed that he had never identified himself as a maverick. And we all know what happens in
Arizona when you don't have ID. Adios, amigos."
168,(End videotape)
169,"MR. GREGORY: Some laughter, Governor Granholm, over, obviously, a very serious issue
that is talked about in terms of boycotts of Arizona, and it's certainly raising more calls for
comprehensive immigration reform."
170,"GOV. GRANHOLM: Yeah, it sure is, and there should be comprehensive immigration reform.
And it's got to be tough on the violators, tough on those who hire illegal immigrants. It's got to
be practical. How do you do it? How do you do it with those who are here? How do you
ensure that it's fair to the taxpayers? And those three things, I think, have to all be a part of it."
171,"But I, I do say from my perspective as a governor in the north, for, for our citizens, really, we
are so focused on jobs that that for us is--has got to be the number one issue, which is why"
172,"I'm a very big proponent of the energy bill as a way to create jobs. So immigration is really
important. Obviously, it's much more important in states like New Mexico. "
173,"MR. GREGORY: But this is an interesting point because, Congressman Pence, the president
came out and said, you know, there was some debate about whether immigration would be an
agenda item that he would push before energy legislation. He said this week there simply aren't
the votes for it, particularly from Republicans."
174,"REP. PENCE: Well, well, let, let's be clear for a second. This is no laughing matter for the
people of Arizona who are--have been profoundly affected by the fact that there's nearly a half a million illegal immigrants and, and a rampant drug trade and, and, and human trafficking trade that's been besetting. Phoenix, Arizona, is, is the kidnapping capital of the United State of America. I don't know if this law is perfect, but I knew--do know that it is wrong for officials in this government to throw stones at the people of Arizona as they're trying to, to reassert the rule of law in the wake of the fact that this administration and this Congress have been
systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control."
175,"MR. GREGORY: Of course, it was Republicans who blocked comprehensive immigration
reform. Let's be clear about that."
176,"REP. PENCE: Well, let--well, let, let's focus on border security first, David."
177,MR. GREGORY: Right.
178,"REP. PENCE: In, in fiscal..."
179,"MR. GREGORY: The bill called for that. The Bush bill called for more border security,
Republicans were with him..."
180,REP. PENCE: Right.
181,MR. GREGORY: ...until they were against him on that.
182,"REP. PENCE: David, here's the numbers. Fiscal 2007, the last year Republicans wrote a
budget, $1.2 billion for border security and fencing. By 2010 that was cut by--to $800 billion.
If you'd kept funding level..."
183,MR. GREGORY: Right.
184,"REP. PENCE: I mean, the Democrats have cut three-quarters of a trillion out of this..."
185,MR. GREGORY: All right.
186,REP. PENCE: ...and the president wants to go to 50 percent of the level that Republicans...
187,MR. GREGORY: Governor...
188,REP. PENCE: ...spent on border security. We have got to take border security seriously.
189,"MR. GREGORY: All right, Governor Richardson..."
190,REP. PENCE: We can't blame Arizonans for trying to reaffirm the rule of law.
191,"MR. GREGORY: ...final, final, final thought on this."
192,"GOV. RICHARDSON: This law in Arizona is terrible. What the administration needs to do is
challenge it because it's unconstitutional. Immigration is a federal matter. One hundred
thousand demonstrators were out on the streets yesterday against this law around this country, dwarfing the tea party demonstrations. There's going to be an anti-immigration hysteria creeping up, and the Congress needs to act. But President Bush deserves credit for trying to move an immigration bill; Senator Obama's--President Obama's on the right path asking for a bill that says an earned legalization, those that have to pay back taxes, learn English, get to the back of the line, pay a fine. More border security, I agree with the congressman. But I think the congressman and many Republicans all they want to do is more border security. Yeah, we need it. I'm on the border, too. We need more technology, we need more border patrol, we need the National Guard. But you have to do it simultaneously as an earned legalization pack. "
193,"MR. GREGORY: Senator, can you get comprehensive immigration reform passed this year?
You're part of the leadership on the Republican side."
194,"SEN. ALEXANDER: Well, the difference is right, right here. We need the secure--instead of
joking about the Arizona situation and suing Arizona, the president ought to work with the
governor and secure the border."
195,MR. GREGORY: Right.
196,"SEN. ALEXANDER: That's his job, he's the commander-in-chief. It's a federal responsibility.
When the border's secure, then we can deal with the people illegally here and how they become citizens or not."
197,"MR. GREGORY: We're going to make that the last word. Thank you all very much.
A special programming note, stay with NBC News for continuing coverage of that oil spill in
the Gulf, including a special edition of ""Nightly News"" with Brian Williams broadcasting live
from New Orleans Monday evening. We'll be back right after this brief station break with a
special look back at our set for the past 62 years."
198,(Announcements)
199,"MR. GREGORY: Finally this morning, our new look. In television, this is what we do. We
evolve. And for a program 62 years old, it's not the first time changes have been made."
200,(Videotape)
201,"Announcer: MEET THE PRESS, where you'll meet top news men in an unrehearsed,
spontaneous press conference."

Television. The last change, March 17th, 1996. Now, time for a fresh, new look, this time in
high definition. The plans were set, 139 days, the best team of designers, construction workers, technical folks, and more, and today, here we are. Yes, I know, it is a large set. Modern and versatile. It's also a living tribute to those who have sat here before me and made this program what it is. However it looks, the mission of the program does not change."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday:  Attorney General Eric Holder sits down for his first live Sunday morning interview.  The question, what does the attempted bombing in Times Square say about the new face of terror?  And what do you do to stop a homegrown threat?
    "
1,"Then, our political roundtable weighs in; the oil spill in the Gulf, the economy and immigration.  Is the government doing too much or not enough? With us, New York Times columnist David Brooks, Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne, the BBC's Katty Kay, and Wes Moore, author of the new book, ""The Other Wes Moore."" Finally, a look back in our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE 21 years ago. Another massive oil spill in U.S. waters, and the questions:  Who cleans it up?  And who pays?"
2,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
3,"Good morning.  The president is close to making a decision on a Supreme Court nominee.  Over the weekend, aides prepared Mr. Obama with materials and their final recommendations, clearing the way for the president to now make his choice to replace retiring Justice Stevens.  Here with us now, the attorney general of the United States, Eric Holder."
4,Welcome to the program.
5,MR. ERIC HOLDER:  Good to be here.
6,"MR. GREGORY:  My apologies for my voice, I'm under the weather.  I'll keep my distance."
7,MR. HOLDER:  All right.
8,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about that Supreme Court choice.  The president will make this decision, will announce this decision as soon as when?"
9,"MR. HOLDER:  I think the decision will be announced very shortly.  The president has had a wealth of good candidates to consider, and I think he's looking for a person who will understand that we have to have a Supreme Court that understands its decisions and the impact those decisions have on the American--the average American person."
10,MR. GREGORY:  An announcement tomorrow?
11,MR. HOLDER:  I think we're going to have an announcement very soon.
12,"MR. GREGORY:  Very soon.  As early as tomorrow, is that fair?"
13,MR. HOLDER:  I'd say we're going to have one very soon.
14,"MR. GREGORY:  One of the people that you work closely with, of course, is thought to be one of the finalists, and that's Elena Kagan, the solicitor general of the United States.  She's 50 years old, she was a former dean of Harvard Law School.  She doesn't have much of a paper trail.  Is it reasonable to expect that we can get an understanding of her judicial philosophy given that background?"
15,"MR. HOLDER:  Oh, yeah.  I think that she's done a great job as solicitor general, the first woman to ever hold that job, the first woman to be the dean of the Harvard Law School.  I think people have a--will get an understanding of who she is, what her judicial, judicial philosophy is, if, in fact, she is, is the pick.  She's done a wonderful job in the Justice Department.  I've known her since the Clinton years, and I think she would be a great justice."
16,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me move on to the Times Square plot.  The suspect involved here is Faisal Shahzad, who is responsible, you have said, for planting a bomb that did not go off in Times Square.  The important question now is whether Shahzad is part of the ongoing jihadist campaign against the United States."
17,"MR. HOLDER:  I can say that the evidence that we've now developed shows that the Pakistani Taliban has directed this plot.  We know that they helped facilitate it, we know that we helped--they helped direct it, and I suspect that we are going to come up with evidence that shows they helped to finance it.  They were intimately involved in this plot."
18,"MR. GREGORY:  Now, the Pakistani Taliban is a militant organization that has pulled off huge terror plots within Pakistan, thought to be behind the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.  What specifically was done here and over what period of time that they would plan to do something rather unusual, which is an external operation against the United States?"
19,"MR. HOLDER:  Well, this is an ongoing investigation, there's only so much that I can talk about, but I am comfortable in saying that they were involved in what Shahzad tried to do.  And I think that's an indication of the new threat that we face, these terrorist organizations, these affiliates of al-Qaeda or--these organizations are somehow connected to the kinds of things that al-Qaeda wants to do, indicates the worldwide concerns that we have to have if we're going to be effective."
20,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, before I ask you about that changing face of terror, is it a danger when you have officials like Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano saying, at this very table last week, that this appeared to be a one-off attack, or the general of Central Command, David Petraeus saying that Shahzad appeared to be a lone wolf, and now you're saying no, this was part of a, a Pakistani Taliban plot?"
21,"MR. HOLDER:  Well, you know, the evidence develops, and I think we have to always try to be careful to make sure that the statements that we make is consistence with the evidence that we have developed.  And it certainly looked, I think, at the beginning of this investigation, like it could have been a one-off.  Over the course of this week, we've developed information, we've developed evidence that shows that the involved--shows the involvement of the Pakistani Taliban."
22,MR. GREGORY:  Was there an attempt to falsely reassure the public?
23,"MR. HOLDER:  No, that's not it at all.  I think that those, those comments--that certainly was my view at least, I think, initially that that was probably what we were, were dealing with, but as the days have passed and as we've had a chance to investigate, we've come to the conclusion that I've just announced."
24,MR. GREGORY:  What kind of cooperation are you--we getting from Pakistan with regard to tracking down those elements who might be responsible and how high up within the Pakistani Taliban organization does this go?
25,"MR. HOLDER:  Well, again, I don't want to get in to too much of the ongoing investigation, but I am satisfied with the help that we've gotten from our Pakistani counterparts.  I think they have done an awful lot; they have been aggressive.  Do we want them to do more?  Yes.  And we will be making more requests of them in the coming days."
26,"MR. GREGORY:  What happened to this guy, Shahzad?  He's an American, he's living happily here with his family, and then he starts traveling back and forth to Pakistan, leaves his family over there and comes back and lives a very different life.  How does he get radicalized, if that's what happened?"
27,MR. HOLDER:  That's not something that we fully understand yet.  He is in the process of cooperating with us.  He's talking to people who are interviewing him on behalf of the United States government.  And part of that is to try to understand what is it that took him over the edge and that converted him from being a person who seemingly was an average American to somebody who was bound and determined to kill Americans.  We are in the process of trying to determine that.
28,"MR. GREGORY:  Why doesn't he get on the radar screen earlier?  If he is ferrying money, as we know, back and forth over a number of years, if you think the Taliban is providing him with money when he's living--when he comes back to the U.S. in pretty modest means, how does he not get on the radar at a time when we know that law enforcement here and intelligence officials are tracking people who go back and forth to Pakistan?"
29,"MR. HOLDER:  Well, that's one of the things that we're looking at, to see if he was, in fact, in any of our databases and to see what we knew about him before the events of, of last week.  Again, the investigation is ongoing, he is cooperating with us, and we think, through the combination of what we're doing and what he is telling us, we'll get a better, better sense of who he is and, and who he was."
30,"MR. GREGORY:  Look at this changing face of terror.  We put up on the screen some of the people who have been involved in recent plots.  You have Najibullah Nazi***(as spoken)***involved in that New York subway plot, an American citizen; Major Nidal Hasan, the Fort Hood massacre, also a U.S.-born Army psychiatrist; then you have Hussain and other students from northern Virginia who go and are arrested in Pakistan; December 2009, Abdulmutallab, he's a Nigerian, but he had a visa to the United States; in March of this year, Colleen Larose, she was called ""Jihad Jane"" for a, a plot to kill a Swedish cartoonist, she's from Pennsylvania; and then Shahzad.  Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff told Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC this week there is a pattern here.  Here's how he described it.  We put that on the screen.  He said, ""This is why they are recruiting people who ...  have clean records, are American citizens, have lived in America, because they want to take advantage of that cleanliness as a way of invading our defenses."" We have a new attempt here to use people who have easy access to the U.S."
31,"MR. HOLDER:  Yeah.  I mean, you certainly hear from them that they're looking for people, as they call it, people with ""clean skins."" They're trying to get people into the country or use people who don't fit any kind of a profile or not people who you might expect to be involved in these kinds of activities. And that's why we have to redouble our efforts in terms of intelligence-gathering to make sure that we are fully cognizant of what is it they're planning to do, who are they trying to use in, in coming up with these plots?  It makes our job more difficult, not one that we can't do, but certainly makes it more difficult."
32,MR. GREGORY:  How many people right now are we tracking who are going back and forth to Pakistan?
33,"MR. HOLDER:  Well, 200,000 people per year go back and forth between the United States and Pakistan, and we're doing a, a fair amount of monitoring with regard to, to that number."
34,"MR. GREGORY:  When, in this context, when is racial profiling illegal?"
35,"MR. HOLDER:  Well, I'm not sure--I don't even talk about whether or not racial profiling is legal, I just don't think racial profiling is a particularly good law enforcement tool.  If one focuses on particular groups, that necessarily means you're taking law enforcement away from places where they probably ought to be, especially given..."
36,MR. GREGORY:  But what happened in this case?
37,MR. HOLDER:  Well...
38,"MR. GREGORY:  Wasn't it racial profiling that led us to ultimately get the most important piece of information from this guy, which was a telephone number that he uses in the plot because he was held aside from for a second screening earlier this year?"
39,"MR. HOLDER:  No.  What led us to him was good normal law enforcement. Looking at what people did tracking down that car, where did that car come from, who owned that car, who sold that car?  Doing all the kinds of things that we do in traditional law enforcement without any resort to, to racial profiling."
40,"MR. GREGORY:  But where is the line, Mr. Attorney General?  Because, I mean, this is very complicated.  If you have U.S. citizens who are being used who are going back and forth to Pakistan--we are tracking people from Pakistan and Yemen for reasons that are relevant, that are germane to law enforcement not because they just happen to be Pakistani.  So where is the line when you talk about profiling?"
41,"MR. HOLDER:  Again, I don't think that profiling is good law enforcement. What you want to do is to see people who are going back and forth, what, in fact, are they doing?  Are they bringing substantial amounts of cash back and forth?  What are they doing when they're over in Pakistan, when they're in Yemen?  What are they doing here in the United States?  Is there a predicate, is there a basis for us to believe that we ought to focus our law enforcement attention on them?  Not based on the basis of the color of their skin or the kind of name that they have, but on the basis of what it is that they do?"
42,"MR. GREGORY:  So if a Pakistani, who is a U.S. citizen, is coming back from Pakistan today and a white woman from Pennsylvania is coming back from Pakistan, you're telling me that at the airports they ought not pay more careful attention to the Pakistani?"
43,"MR. HOLDER:  You ought to pay attention to the person who you have a suspicion about, a person who you have a basis to believe wants to do harm to our nation.  If you look at the arrest that we made in Pennsylvania of white women, those were people who were bound and determined to do something very negative with regard to the United States..."
44,MR. GREGORY:  Do you...
45,MR. HOLDER:  ...and racial profiling would not have picked those people up.
46,MR. GREGORY:  Do you support stripping American citizenship from those who are thought to be involved in terrorist activity?
47,"MR. HOLDER:  You know, that's something that Senator Lieberman has proposed. I've really not had a chance to look at the bill that I guess he is in the process of, of putting together.  But I do know that using just traditional law enforcement techniques we can put people in jail for extended periods of time, we can put them in jail for the rest of their lives, we can even execute them.  I think there are constitutional concerns with the bill that Senator Lieberman is proposing."
48,"MR. GREGORY:  You issued a Miranda warning to Shahzad, the right to remain silent, at which point a lot of defendants, suspects could get a lawyer.  You did that after eight hours and after you had already gotten him talking. There's criticism about injecting the possibility that a suspect will not provide intelligence if you give them that Miranda warning.  Take me through that process of what the balancing test is before Miranda is actually issued."
49,"MR. HOLDER:  Well, I wouldn't say that we talked to him for eight hours without giving his Miranda warnings, but aside from that what you do is you use the public safety exception that the Supreme Court has defined to make sure that there are no immediate threats."
50,"MR. GREGORY:  The quote/unquote ""ticking time bomb"" scenario."
51,"MR. HOLDER:  Ticking time bomb.  And then you make the determination whether or not it is appropriate, whether you think that giving Miranda warnings to that person is going to stop the flow of information or whether the flow of information will continue, and you make the determination.  In this particular case, is it more important for us to get intelligence from this person, or is it more important for us to build the case?  One of the things that we have certainly seen is that the giving of Miranda warnings has not stopped these terror suspects from talking to us.  They have continued to talk even though we have given them a Miranda warning."
52,MR. GREGORY:  Is that still the case here with Shahzad?
53,"MR. HOLDER:  It's clearly the case.  He was given his Miranda warnings after the public safety exception questioning was finished, and he has talked to us and he continues to talk to us."
54,MR. GREGORY:  But would you like interrogators to have more flexibility?
55,"MR. HOLDER:  I think we have to look at the rules that we have and look at the situation that we now confront.  The public safety exception was really based on a robbery that occurred back in the '80s and something to do with a supermarket.  We're now dealing with international terrorists, and I think that we have to think about perhaps modifying the rules that interrogators have and somehow coming up with something that is flexible and is more consistent with the threat that we now face."
56,"MR. GREGORY:  So let me, let me unpack that a little bit.  What you'd like to see happen is that Congress would pass a law that would say to judges, ""Hey, look, in this environment if we extract information that could be valuable intelligence about another terror plot, about who they're involved in, whether they're connected to the Pakistani Taliban, we want to get all that without them lawyering up and still be able to use that against them in the court of law."" And you need more flexibility to do that, you think."
57,"MR. HOLDER:  Yeah.  We certainly need more flexibility, and we want the public safety exception to be consistent with the public safety concerns that we now have in the 21st century as opposed to the public safety concerns that we had back in the 1980s."
58,"MR. GREGORY:  So that's news.  I mean, that's an important development. Would you work with Congress to try to get that new law passed?"
59,"MR. HOLDER:  Yeah.  We want to work with Congress to come up with a way in which we make our public safety exception more flexible and, again, more consistent with the threat that we face.  And yes, this is, in fact, big news. This is a proposal that we're going to be making and that we want to work with Congress about."
60,MR. GREGORY:  So a new priority for the administration.
61,MR. HOLDER:  It is a new priority.
62,MR. GREGORY:  Will Shahzad be tried in civilian court?
63,MR. HOLDER:  We will see.  I suspect that he will.  We have developed information that I think we can use in a civilian court.  It's not even sure at this point whether or not there'll even have to be a trial.
64,"MR. GREGORY:  OK.  But if there is a trial, it's not a decision you've made 100 percent yet."
65,MR. HOLDER:  No.  But I suspect he'd be in the civilian court.
66,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk about another decision you haven't made yet with regard to a trial for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind behind 9/11.  You announced that he would be in a civilian trial in New York.  And when you made that announcement back in November, this is what you said."
67,"(Videotape, November 13, 2009)"
68,"MR. HOLDER:  For over 200 years our nation has relied on a faithful adherence to the rule of law to bring criminals to justice and provide accountability to victims.  Once again, we will ask our legal system in two venues to rise to that challenge.  I am confident that it will answer the call with fairness and with justice."
69,(End videotape)
70,"MR. GREGORY:  Fairness and justice.  That same month you were asked what happens if Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is acquitted, and this is what you said."
71,"(Videotape, November 18, 2009)"
72,"MR. HOLDER:  If there were the possibility that a trial was not successful, that would not mean that that person would be released into, into our country. That would--that is not a possibility."
73,(End videotape)
74,"MR. GREGORY:  So, if he's acquitted, he would not be released.  How is that consistent, Mr. Attorney General, with fairness and justice that you believe in of our system?"
75,"MR. HOLDER:  Well, he certainly would be provided fairness and justice with regard to the trial that would occur.  And with regard to the outcome of that trial, we have--if--and if he were acquitted, what I was trying to say that there are other mechanisms that we have that we might employ, immigration laws that we could use, the possibility of detaining him under the wars of law. There are a variety of things that we can do in order to protect the American people, and that is the thing that I keep uppermost in my mind."
76,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but if he's acquitted and the United States says we will not let him free, then what is the point of having a trial?"
77,"MR. HOLDER:  Well, there are other charges that are--that could be brought against him in addition to those he would stand accused of with regard to the 9/11 plot.  There are a variety of other things that he could be tried for. And I think we can provide him with fairness and with justice in the systems that we now have in place."
78,"MR. GREGORY:  But you said, with regard to any KSM trial, failure is not an option, and yet you know full well you send prosecutors into court every day in this country knowing that there is plenty of uncertainty.  Paul McNulty, the former deputy attorney general, said earlier this year with regard to the Moussaoui prosecution, he said, ""The criminal justice process is not designed to guarantee any particular outcome.  If that option (civilian court) is followed, we have to accept that it is unpredictable."" A trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in civilian court is unpredictable, isn't it?"
79,"MR. HOLDER:  Well, I'm confident that if we try him in a civilian court, given the evidence that we have amassed, given the experience of the prosecutors who would try the case, given the skills that they have, that we will stand a very, very good chance of, of convicting him."
80,"MR. GREGORY:  But that's not what you said.  You said failure is not an option.  You said he will not be released.  And the broader criticism is, of you, that you say you believe in our civilian justice system.  And you said when you became attorney general that ""I'm going to stick to those principles even when it's hard."" And yet, with all the political pressure to be tough on terrorists, you said ""I believe in the system"" at the same time you appear to be rewriting the rules of that system, which, ultimately, critics say, can undermine the system.  Even with Shahzad, before he was charged, you held a press conference announcing that he had confessed.  Shouldn't that be a concern to those who work with you and others who believe, as you say you do, in our civilian justice system?"
81,"MR. HOLDER:  Well, I believe in the civilian justice system.  I have certainly worked all my life in the civilian justice system.  I have confidence in the civilian justice system's ability to handle these new threats that our, our, our country faces with regard to Shahzad, with regard to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.  I think that we have conducted ourselves in a way that's consistent with the best that is about our, our, our civilian justice system.  I'm not--I don't think that I have to take back anything that I have said in the past.  One of the things that we did with regard to that press conference was to get out there early to assure the American people generally and people in New York specifically that the person we thought was responsible for that attempted bombing was, in fact, in custody."
82,MR. GREGORY:  Will KSM be tried in New York?
83,MR. HOLDER:  We are still in the process of trying to decide where that trial will occur.
84,"MR. GREGORY:  What is the holdup?  Everybody seems to be saying this is a foregone conclusion, it's never going to New York.  Why won't you say that it won't be there?"
85,"MR. HOLDER:  Well, we're taking a look at all of our options and trying to decide where the case can best be tried.  There are federal statutes that we have to deal with that dictate where the case would have to occur if we're going to seek the death penalty, as I've indicated that we will.  There are a variety of things that have to be taken into consideration, both--in addition to what I've talked about, we also have to take into account what the political leadership in these various jurisdictions wants, what the, what the people in these various..."
86,"MR. GREGORY:  New York doesn't want it.  New York doesn't have the resources for it.  You just deployed all these FBI agents to catch Shahzad.  What if they had to protect a trial of KSM?  I mean, it's fairly clear that it doesn't belong in New York, according to elected officials and other law enforcement officials, and yet there is this basically inaction on this issue of where the trial is.  Is this being overly politicized by this administration and by you?"
87,"MR. HOLDER:  No, it's not being overly politicized.  What we're trying to do is come up with the best decision that we can.  We're taking our time, we're considering all of our options.  We want to make sure that we put this trial in the place where it can best be held."
88,MR. GREGORY:  Should it be a military tribunal?
89,MR. HOLDER:  That is one of the things that we are in the process of trying to decide.
90,MR. GREGORY:  Is it more likely that now than a civilian trial?
91,"MR. HOLDER:  No, I wouldn't say one is more likely than the other at this point.  We are, as I said, working our way through this and, again, trying to come up with the best place for the trial to occur."
92,"MR. GREGORY:  But critics, including more progressive, liberal critics of this administration and of you say, ""Look, you said there was going to be a civilian trial, you said you were going to close down Guantanamo, you announced that there would be five military tribunals when you made the announcement about Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.  What is the holdup?  Gitmo is still open, there is no movement on military tribunals.  And, by the way, what happens if you capture operatives on the battlefield somewhere overseas?  You have nowhere to put them."""
93,"MR. HOLDER:  Well, there are a variety of questions you put up--you've packed a lot into that one question."
94,MR. GREGORY:  You can unpack it.
95,"MR. HOLDER:  There are a whole bunch of things that we have to do.  First, with regard to Guantanamo, we're bound and determined to close Guantanamo.  It is a place that has served as a recruiting tool for, for al-Qaeda, and so we're in the process of working our way through that.  We've asked Congress, in the budget for the Justice Department for 2011, to give us the money necessary to buy a facility in Thompson, Illinois, and we would be able to close Guantanamo, transfer prisoners there.  With regard to the selection of a trial site, that is something that we are working through with our law enforcement components, with the intelligence community, to try to come up with ways in which we can find the best place to try, to try the case."
96,"MR. GREGORY:  But you will stick to your belief in the civilian justice system.  If Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is acquitted in a U.S. court, will the United States let him free?"
97,"MR. HOLDER:  We will consider our options at the conclusion of that unlikely event.  As I said, there are other charges that can be brought.  It is hard for me to imagine a situation in which he would be let free given all the evidence that we have against him with regard to the trial that we would bring, and then beyond that with regard to other charges that we have and other abilities that we have to try to keep him detained."
98,"MR. GREGORY:  Two other matters before we are out of time.  Arizona:  What is specifically wrong with the anti-immigration law that has been passed there, and are you close to filing a legal challenge to it?"
99,"MR. HOLDER:  Well, one of the things I think we have to acknowledge is that our immigration system is broken in many ways, and I think it requires a national solution.  The concern I have is trying to do it state by state.  I understand the frustration of people in Arizona, but the concern I have about the law that they have passed is that I think it has the possibility of leading to racial profiling and putting a wedge between law enforcement and a community that would, in fact, be profiled.  People in that community are less likely then to cooperate with people in law enforcement, less likely to share information, less likely to be witnesses in a case that law enforcement is trying to solve."
100,MR. GREGORY:  So you're close to filing a legal challenge to it?
101,"MR. HOLDER:  We are considering all of our options, and we--one of the things that we are thinking about is the possibility of filing, filing a lawsuit. But we're considering all of our options at this point.  Whether or not it is something that we can file a lawsuit based on federal pre-emption grounds, whether we think that the law as enacted could violate federal civil rights statutes."
102,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Finally, on the issue of race, when you first became attorney general, you, you talked about the country being ""a nation of cowards,"" and you said we, as average Americans, simply do not talk enough with each other about race.  Do you think that's changed since the president's been elected?"
103,"MR. HOLDER:  I think it's changed a bit.  I don't--still don't think we're at a place where we need to be.  I think that we need to talk to each other more about race and the racial things that divide us, especially when one looks at the demographic changes that this nation is about to undergo.  The demographic changes we're about to undergo can, I think, be a real source of pride, real source of strength for this nation if we handle that change in the correct way.  If we don't, it can be a very divisive thing.  And one of the things I think we can do in that regard is to talk to one another about race and about these coming changes so that it becomes a positive force in this nation."
104,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you think the discussion about immigration, the arguments about what's happening in Arizona is, is part of more constructive dialogue?"
105,"MR. HOLDER:  Yeah.  I think this is, I think, I think a teaching possibility that we have here, to talk about why people think this law is good, why other people think this law is bad, and then to unpack that and go underneath what those arguments are all about and have a very frank dialogue about what we really think about ourselves as individuals, as members of different ethnic groups.  I think we need to have that courage and, and have those kinds of conversations."
106,"MR. GREGORY:  We will leave it there.  Attorney General Holder, thank you very much."
107,MR. HOLDER:  Thanks for having me.
108,MR. GREGORY:  Appreciate it.
109,"Coming up next, big tests for the Obama administration--the oil spill in the gulf, the economy, and immigration.  Is enough being done?  Our roundtable weighs in--David Brooks, E.J.  Dionne, Katty Kay, and Wes Moore.  Plus, our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE, another massive oil spill and the cleanup that followed, only on MEET THE PRESS."
110,(Announcements)
111,"MR. GREGORY:  The economy, immigration reform and a major environmental disaster.  Is government doing too much or not enough.  Our political roundtable weighs in right after this brief commercial break."
112,(Announcements)
113,"MR. GREGORY:  And we're back with our roundtable, columnist David Brooks of The New York Times and E.J.  Dionne of The Washington Post, both still trying to get use to the new surroundings here, Katty Kay of the BBC, and we are welcoming for the first time Wes Moore to the discussion.  He's a newly published author of a book about two young men trying to find their way in a hostile world, ""The Other Wes Moore."" He works on Wall Street as an associate at Citigroup's global banking division and is a former White House fellow and retired captain in the U.S. Army who fought in Afghanistan."
114,"So welcome, Wes, and welcome to everyone here."
115,"David Brooks, there's plenty of news this morning to talk about from that interview with Attorney General Holder.  The fact that he said the Pakistan Taliban directed Faisal Shahzad in this plot in Times Square takes us in a different direction."
116,"MR. DAVID BROOKS:  Right.  Well, it internationalizes it.  There, there was, as you mentioned, people say it was a lone wolf, but now we know it's part of a larger war, part of the longer war on terror.  One of the reasons we--President Obama doubled down in Afghanistan is because the Taliban is not only an Afghan thing, it's a transborder movement, trying to destabilize Pakistan, trying to destabilize Afghanistan and that region and beyond.  And we've been pretty devastating against them with drone attacks and other things; and in war, the enemy gets to fight back, and they're fighting back using American citizens.  But it does take this event and put it in a much broader international context."
117,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Wes Moore, part of that context now includes our military posture with regard to Pakistan.  What's Pakistan doing to crack down on the Pakistani Taliban, which, by the way, has been responsible for huge attacks there--Rawalpindi and Peshawar, as well as the assassination of Bhutto.  Will there be greater pressure now for U.S. military operation in Pakistan?  We can be in Afghanistan, the bad guys are in Pakistan."
118,"MR. WES MOORE:  Yeah.  Well, I think the, the bad guys are in both places."
119,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
120,"MR. MOORE:  I think it's important to remember that as well.  And I think we've started to see a lot more cooperation from, from the Pakistani side of the, side of the, you know, side of the borders in terms of elect, you know, intelligence collection and also in terms of military reinforcement.  But I think one thing we have to remember about that border region is it is very porous, and the ideas of these distinctive nationalistic borders are, in some cases, relatively almost imaginary because it's still a very tribal system. So that's why making sure that we have forces on side of the, the Afghan side of the border, not only for reconstruction and development purposes, but also for intelligence collection as well, becomes a--you know, becomes very important, not just on the Afghan side, but also on the Pakistan side, as well."
121,"MR. GREGORY:  You know, Katty, the other thing, I talked to intelligence officials this week who said, it's not just the military questions about our posture in Pakistan, it also is what does this portend for Pakistani-Americans who are now coming into the United States?  What kind of screening are we talking about?  What kind of job are we doing that's not just about our defenses and how Shahzad got on an airplane when he was on a no-fly list, but a question about what are we doing to disrupt plots in Pakistan?"
122,"MS. KATTY KAY:  Well, the issue of screening, of course, is one that Eric Holder raised, and it is something that, whether we say it or not, is happening.  I'm sure that, you know, there is more scrutiny of Pakistani-Americans coming into the country than there might be of other Americans coming into the country.  It is happening already.  Whether that--there's an argument about whether that kind of racial profiling drives people to extremism.  I've heard moderate Muslims here in America say to me they have known people who were moderate, law-abiding Muslims who, when they have felt racial screening when they were at airports, have actually then turned towards extremism.  So it's, it's a dangerous weapon, racial screening. I think it is already happening here."
123,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
124,MS. KAY:  But it is something that has to be used very carefully.
125,MR. GREGORY:  E.J.?
126,"MR. E.J.  DIONNE:  Well, I--first of all, happy Mother's Day to Katty and all the moms out there."
127,"MR. GREGORY:  Yes, indeed.  Forgive me for, for missing that."
128,"MR. DIONNE:  The, the--you know, I, I was struck during that conversation about racial profiling that the woman from Pennsylvania would not have been caught or stopped or interrogated..."
129,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
130,"MR. DIONNE:  ...if this were the central approach to stopping terrorists.  I mean, this is a hard problem.  How do we protect ourselves and, at the same time, remain a nation rooted in liberty and law?  And we have faced this problem many times in our history going back to the Civil War, the two world wars, particularly World War I, the Cold War, and we haven't always privileged liberty as a country.  And I think what you're seeing in this debate is a kind of choice between a muddled approach--and I think the Obama administration has been muddled because it's very complicated..."
131,MS. KAY:  Mm-hmm.
132,"MR. DIONNE:  ...vs. demagoguery, where anytime they seem to lean in any way toward civil liberties, somebody jumps on them.  But I tell you what scares me is the rise of less sophisticated forms of terror.  A car bomb is not flying a plane into a building, yet--you know, I spent time in Lebanon during the civil war there--car bombs are frightening.  We are very lucky, a combination of luck and skill of our police forces that we've stopped things so far.  But this..."
133,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
134,MR. DIONNE:  ...would portend--I just pray these things don't succeed because this really is terrorism by every definition.
135,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But there--I mean the reality is you ultimately cannot stop attacks from happening.  You can try, David, to disrupt the plots, you can, to be blunt about it, kill the people with predator drones or troops or whatever who are organizing them.  And there are probably a finite number of really good people over there who can launch these attacks because Shahzad was clearly not the cream of the crop."
136,"MR. BROOKS:  Yeah.  And what's amazing to me is the, is the personality is so consistent over so many of these cases.  You get a young man from a privileged background, as this was, as Mohammad Atta was, as many others have been, they go to study, for some reason often engineering and medicine, and they're caught between two worlds, the modern world that we live in and an imagined pure Islam of the seventh or eighth century.  And then they revert back to that Islam.  So we focus on the terror networks and because we like to think on material things, but it is an ideology."
137,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
138,"MR. BROOKS:  And so in dealing that, that--we can't defeat that except through resilience.  And one good thing I thought Holder did today was to talk about revising some of the Miranda rules, and that is to give them flexibility.  We cannot lawyer ourselves up so that people on the scene of a crime are bound by rules that are very strict."
139,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
140,"MR. BROOKS:  It's important to give them authority and responsibility and then just hold them accountable afterwards.  But, but loosening up the level of regulation and what they can do at the time of the crime seems to me really important."
141,"MR. GREGORY:  And that is interesting.  I mean, what they're saying is, as we outlined it with Holder, is that they want a new law that gives them--gives the interrogators more latitude than they apparently have now because even Holder has said, back in 2002, when you introduce a lawyer into the equations--into the equation, it's sometimes hard to get the information you need."
142,"MR. MOORE:  It is.  And actually, I wholeheartedly agree that I think it--it's good that we are willing to revisit and look at the Miranda laws. But one thing I also know is, is one of the core, one of the core things about our country is that we are nation of laws."
143,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
144,"MR. MOORE:  And that's one of the things that people respect about us, you know, throughout the world.  And I know from, from firsthand experience that when we have people who, who--if we have situations where it looks like that's not being administered, where we're not living up to those highest tenets, it makes things a lot more difficult and dangerous, not only for our soldiers abroad, but also for our people at home."
145,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to--while we're talking about overseas developments, I want to talk about Hamid Karzai.  The president of Afghanistan will be coming to the United States.  He last, of course, met with President Obama in--this was back in March in Kabul.  This was a meeting that did not go well.  The message has gone down from on high in this administration, ""Stop publicly trashing Karzai.  We got to work with this guy."" He's coming for a big visit here to the United States."
146,"MS. KAY:  Yeah.  And the hope will be that they can improve relations in some way, that Karzai has--seems to now be sticking with the White House, and the White House seems to be sticking with Karzai largely out of default.  I mean, there doesn't seem to be anybody else in Afghanistan that they can deal with particularly.  He is elected in--to the extent that the elections were free and fair at all, he is the elected leader of Afghanistan.  I think, you know, it is very worrying.  There are two measures by which we can measure our success against Islamic extremism, one is attacks against the West, the other is violence in Afghanistan and Pakistan."
147,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
148,"MS. KAY:  On both of those measures, we still see attacks against the West and attempted attacks and violence in Afghanistan and Pakistan is at record highs.  So clearly the, the situation there is still extremely volatile.  The Pakistanis are on board to some extent with dealing with extremists, but they're not dealing with all the extremists that they need to be dealing with."
149,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Let me--I want to talk about some domestic matters now.
150,"You want to make a point on that, E.J.?  Go ahead."
151,"MR. DIONNE:  I just want to say, I just want to say I, I just hate this term ""lawyered up."""
152,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
153,"MR. DIONNE:  Because if you are accused of a crime and you are innocent, you want a lawyer to defend your innocence.  And we totally forget that we have civil liberties protections not only to protect the guilty but to protect innocent people.  And this is..."
154,"MR. GREGORY:  But E.J., this is not just an ideological argument.  There is a reality that..."
155,"MR. DIONNE:  Well, I'm not making an ideological argument.  I'm making an argument about..."
156,"MR. GREGORY:  No, no, but you're saying you don't like the term ""lawyered up."""
157,MR. DIONNE:  ...what a term that's...
158,"MR. GREGORY:  There is--even the attorney general is making the point--it's not a question just of civil liberties, it's an issue of there are intelligence values, there are--there is valuable intelligence that you get from people who are true enemies of the United States who are not just, you know, suspects in a criminal trial.  Even the attorney general recognized back in 2002 in the--for the purpose of interrogation, sometimes lawyers are an impediment.  He's acknowledging here that Miranda is sometimes an impediment to ultimately making the, the best case and also getting the intelligence information you need."
159,"MR. DIONNE:  And what I objected to is a term, ""lawyered up,"" which is used over and over again to imply that any kind of use of normal judicial process, which is designed to protect innocence, sort of pushes us so far down the line that we forget why we have these protections in the first place."
160,"MR. BROOKS:  Yeah, but I, I wasn't being..."
161,"MR. DIONNE:  Yes, this is a--this is--I said right at the outset, protecting liberty and protecting ourselves, this is a tough matter when it comes to terrorism.  But we should not throw out our rights with sort of the, the--blithely, which is the way a term like ""lawyered up,"" I think that's imposed."
162,MS. KAY:  And that...
163,"MR. BROOKS:  No, no, nobody's talking, nobody's talking about throwing out their rights.  But we do have a balance here.  We have a tension, a tension between the rights of the individual and the safety of the country, and that tension cannot be settled abstractly from Washington from far away.  It's context by context, case by case.  And we have people with authorities, and at some point you just have to trust the people with authorities to make the decisions..."
164,"MS. KAY:  But, David..."
165,MR. BROOKS:  ...based on that specific context.
166,"MS. KAY:  ...some of, some of this is intensely political.  Look, President Bush tried hundreds of terror suspects in civilian courts.  He tried Zacarias Moussaoui, he tried Richard Reid in civilian courts.  Nobody ever criticized his administration, either from the left or the right, for using civilian courts.  Now here's President Obama who, perhaps because Democrats are--always seem to be softer on terror, and that is a very big issue in this country, can--is even being criticized by Democrats for using civilian courts.  It's a double standard."
167,"MR. BROOKS:  Yeah, I'm not--listen, I'm defending the Obama administration today because the Obama administration is moving in the right direction, away from overly strict and abstract rules into some sort of local flexibility."
168,"MR. GREGORY:  Let, let--can--I just want to, I want to, I want to get the issue of the Supreme Court here because it looks like we're, we're about to have news on that in, in some immediate period, maybe tomorrow, and that is the president's Supreme Court pick.  Here are the finalists as best we can determine it.  Among the names, you--we talked about Elena Kagan, the solicitor general; Judge Merrick Garland is on the D.C.  circuit; and also Judge Diane Wood, with whom the president has a pretty close personal relationship, has known her for some period of time."
169,"E.J., back to you on this.  What's going to make up the president's mind?"
170,"MR. DIONNE:  Well, I think putting this in the context of future fights is one, he's got--he probably will have another nomination.  But he is somebody who really has--he has a lot of self-confidence.  There's probably no issue on which he has more self-confidence than this one.  He is a law professor--he was a law professor, he knows all these people.  The scuttlebutt around Washington is Elena Kagan is going to be the choice, I have no idea if that's true.  I think--I should confess a bias, I've known Merrick Garland since college.  I think one of the questions here is what is this fight going to be about?  I think the fight should be about the rise of a new conservative judicial activism, going back to the same fights we had during the New Deal of trying to limit Congress' authority to intervene in the economy.  I think--you know, I think Elena could do a good job on that.  Merrick Garland also, as somebody who really has been a restrained liberal judge, would be a good person to have that fight on the court."
171,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.  Katty?
172,"MS. KAY:  I think Elena Kagan is known as somebody who can lead and I think that is important to the White House as well at the moment.  She can sway opinions of other judges.  And, of course, Justice Kennedy as a swing judge is particularly important.  She has a fierce intellect.  She's known actually, curiously, people from Harvard describe her similar terms to the way they described Obama..."
173,MR. DIONNE:  Yes.
174,"MS. KAY:  ...that she's known as a consensualist, somebody who can listen to different points of view and bring people together.  And I think in this divided court, that might be important for the White House as well.  The other thing is, if he is looking down the road and, perhaps, one of the women was to go, if he appointed another woman now, that still leaves him with two women on the court further down the road."
175,"MR. GREGORY:  And there's a political calculation as well, which is you--you've got a large enough majority to maybe go with a more progressive nominee, and there's a thought that somebody like a Judge Garland is somebody that you save when you've got a tighter political climate because he might be more noncontroversial.  The question of how big of a lift this is going to be is an issue."
176,"MR. MOORE:  I think it is, and I think that's, you know, definitely something the president's trying to evaluate in terms of how much political capital will have to go into the decision."
177,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
178,"MR. MOORE:  But I think that one thing the president is also, you know, seemingly, when you're looking at him making this final decision, are some of the other intangibles that have been, that have been spoken about.  And looking at what type of court is going to--is this--you know, what type of addition is this going to make to the court, and also, what type of, what type of addition is this going to make in terms of the stability of the court, the challenge to Justice Roberts as well, and how do you balance that court decision out?"
179,"MR. GREGORY:  The, the politics also interesting not just in terms of the Supreme Court but because of the midterm race as well.  And we had a development yesterday that really makes you stand up and take notice.  Senator Bennett, Bob Bennett of Utah, a well-known conservative, been in the Senate for a number of years, is out in a primary in Utah.  He spoke to reporters afterward and was, was obviously emotional about it."
180,"(Videotape, May 8, 2010)"
181,"SEN. BOB BENNETT (R-UT):  The political atmosphere obviously has been toxic, and it's very clear that some of the votes that I have cast have added to the toxic environment.  ...  I offer my congratulations, as I say, to whoever wins.  But I assure him he will not have any more loyal, dedicated, or efficient staff than I've had."
182,(End videotape)
183,"MR. GREGORY:  David Brooks, a reliable conservative for 18 years, yet he proposed an alternative on health care and he voted for the bank bailout."
184,"MR. BROOKS:  Right.  It is a damn outrage, to be honest.  I mean, this is a guy who was a very good senator, and he was a good senator for--and a good conservative, but a good conservative who was trying to get things done.  The Wyden-Bennett Bill, which he co-sponsored, if you took the healthcare economists in the country, they would probably be for that bill ideally.  It was a substantive, serious bill, a bipartisan bill, but with strong conservative and some liberal support.  So he did something sort of brave by working with Democrats, which more senators should do, and now they've been sent a big message, ""Don't do that."" The second thing is the TARP.  Nobody liked the TARP, but we were in a complete economic meltdown and sometimes you have to do terrible things.  And we're in a much better economic place because of the TARP.  So he bravely cast a vote that nobody wanted to really cast, and now he's losing his career over that.  And it's just a damn outrage."
185,"MR. DIONNE:  I agree with David on this, and I think that something's happening inside the Republican Party that I think in the long run won't be good for the Republican Party.  You just had an election in Britain where David Cameron, the conservative, almost got a majority by saying, ""We need to detoxify, take the rough edges off conservativism, appeal to a broader constituency."" And here you have a state party convention, by the way, not a primary.  It's almost a nonviolent coup because they deny the sitting Republican senator even a chance of getting on the primary ballot.  And I think the party, over the long run, risks a backlash among voters who may not be liberal at all but don't like this kind of politics.  And before people on the right crow too much about this, it is a party convention in Utah."
186,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
187,MR. DIONNE:  I would imagine the left would win a party convention on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  So let's not sort of make this into a bigger thing than it is.  But it is a big deal to dump somebody like Bob Bennett.
188,"MS. KAY:  Well, well, it isn't just Utah, because there are other places around the country, clearly, where the Republicans are going to sit through the same sort of fight.  I've just come back from Kentucky and was interviewing Rand Paul.  He's in exactly the same position.  He's being backed by the tea party, he's up against the Republican establishment candidate.  He says he's facing very strong headwinds, but the movement is in his favor and he's ahead in the polls.  There is something, as you say, going on in the party and going on in the country of, you know, this anti-incumbency mood, which is actually really playing out."
189,"MR. MOORE:  And, and I think that's actually a really important point too, that it, it's not just within the Republican Party.  I think this, this was a clear message to all incumbents that, that everybody's put on notice.  I mean, one of the safest seats and one of the safest jobs traditionally has been if you are a member of, of Congress.  The vast majority of congressional seats are not contested generally."
190,"MR. GREGORY:  But we're not having the kinds of purity tests across the board that we see in some of these Republican races where they are looking, in, in part because of the tea party influence, to say, ""Where were you on the bailout?  Where are you on the issue of, you know, big government right now?"""
191,"MR. BROOKS:  Right.  And that's become the big argument we've talked about this show on the--in the past.  I think it's because people have a sense--and to be fair to the other side, which I disagree with--they have a sense, ""I went to high school, I worked hard.  Other people didn't.  I started a company, I worked hard.  Other people didn't.  And now I'm being taxed to bail out people who either didn't work hard or screwed up.  I peel--feel my basic values are being violated."""
192,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
193,"MR. BROOKS:  And that's what's motivating these people, and I completely understand that.  But the fact is in government you can be a conservative and still deal with the other side.  And people like Senator Bennett or Lindsey Graham, they're solid conservatives who know how to deal with the other side, and you have to allow room for that in politics."
194,"MR. GREGORY:  Part of the debate that we're having that is a bigger debate, and, and in this context we can think about Arizona immigration, the president says he does want an immigration law this year; the oil spill in the gulf, the government's response, the issue of regulation.  I thought, E.J., you, you caught this in, in your column on Thursday about the role of government.  We posed this at the top of the program, doing too little or doing too much? This is the big political question this year.  This is how you phrased it, E.J.:  ""The more important and dynamic force behind the current disillusionment with government comes instead from those who actually believe it can and should be effective.  They do not think that the market is automatically rational or that the government has to be dumb.  They are fed up with government not because their ideology, ideology or philosophy tells them to be but because they don't think government has been doing a proper job of promoting prosperity, equity and fair-dealing.  So far, the Obama administration has missed the opportunity to demonstrate to such voters how it is changing the way government works."" So what has to happen?"
195,"MR. DIONNE:  Well, I think that the--we, we talk so much about the tea party folks, who represent a current of opinion in this country, but it's a current of opinion that's always been there.  I think the increment in mistrust to government comes from people who actually want government to work, who don't look for a sort of tiny government.  And these recent events suggest that we need government there at certain moments.  It's a line I quote all the time from former Senator Bill Cohen, ""government is the enemy until you need a friend."" And whether you look at what's happened in the gulf, what--in the Gulf of Mexico, what happened with that coal mining incident where we're going to look at how regulation work, you need a government role in certain instances.  And I think one of the things Bill Clinton did with Al Gore's reinventing government project is accept the idea that if you are a liberal or a progressive, you're going to use government.  But people don't trust that government will always work well."
196,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
197,"MR. DIONNE:  And you have a constant task of persuading people, ""I am changing this in ways to make it work."" There have been reforms in our agencies under Obama.  People don't see any of them.  I think that people who are progressive really have to persuade people, ""Yes, we're doing this in a better and different way."""
198,"MR. GREGORY:  Dave, do you, do you have a different view of it?"
199,"MR. BROOKS:  Yeah, I think it's all about values.  Is government reinforcing my values about hard work and individual responsibility?  And the bailouts violated people's sense of that.  If government--welfare reform, it was big government.  It was kind of intrusive, but it reinforced the values you work and you get something for it, and people were fine with that.  And so to me it's about whether government is enforcing our values or seemingly undermining our values."
200,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet in the U.K., Katty, you have a third party that rears its head in this election and has an impact.  As you analyze for us what's ahead on that, you know, we're all thinking about, in, in this context of government, how the notion of a third party plays here."
201,"MS. KAY:  Well, actually, I think the lesson from Britain is that the third party didn't get very far.  I mean, there is a king maker.  Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats are in negotiations this weekend with David Cameron and the conservatives to try and see if they can form a coalition government.  But there was all that excitement, largely fueled by the television debates that we had, about Nick Clegg and the rise of this personality.  But in the end, when it came to voting, British voters tended to go back to their old parties. They went back to Labour, and they went back to the Conservatives.  And to some extent, what's happening in Britain would be just fantastic political theater if it weren't happening, again, in this incredible economic backdrop where we have major fiscal problems that have to be dealt with, a minority government can't deal with them, and which actually then have ripple effects around the world."
202,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, I'm going to have to make that the last word.  Thank you all very much.  We're going to leave it there, but we're going to continue our discussion with author Wes Moore here in our MEET THE PRESS Take Two Web extra.  You can read an excerpt from his book, ""The Other Wes Moore,"" and find updates from me throughout the week.  It's all on our Web site, mtp.msnbc.com."
203,"And up next, our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE.  Twenty-one years ago, another massive oil spill threatening the U.S. coastline.  Who cleans it up and who pays the bill?  Right after this brief station break."
204,(Announcements)
205,"MR. GREGORY:  And we're back with our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE.  The attempt to use a containment dome to stop the leaking BP oil well in the Gulf of Mexico appears to have failed.  The well exploded 19 days ago and has since spewed three million gallons of oil into the ocean, threatening the economic and ecological well-being of the region.  It is the biggest such disaster since March 24th, 1989 when the Exxon Valdez oil tanker ran aground in Prince William Sound Alaska, spilling an estimated 11 million gallons of crude oil across 1300 miles of coastline.  Six months into the major cleanup effort, EPA administrator William Reilly appeared right here on MEET THE PRESS and challenged Exxon's claim that the job was done."
206,"(Videotape, September 10, 1989)"
207,"MR. GARRICK UTLEY:  Mr. Reilly, let's begin with Alaska, the oil spill there, the Exxon Valdez, as you know, as we said on ""Sunday Today"" this morning, that cleanup is ending this week.  Exxon says it's done the job, it's done it well.  What's your comment?"
208,"MR. WILLIAM REILLY:  Well, my comment is the job isn't done.  We had a catastrophe of extraordinary magnitude, really unprecedented for the United States, back in March.  I think in fairness the government, the corporation, the state anticipated nothing of that sort.  We all perhaps have been lulled by the great success of those tanker shipments, some 9,000 of them, that had come down without major incident.  But there's a lot still to do.  I was up there just last month, and it's very clear we're going to have to go back in. Exxon is going to have to go back in in the spring, as they intend to do, and survey what the problems are, and then, if there's remaining work to be done, to do it."
209,"MR. UTLEY:  Now what happens next spring if Exxon says, ""We don't really want to continue,"" or next summer they say simply, ""The job's done."" What do you do?  What should Congress do?"
210,"Mr. REILLY:  Well, if the Coast Guard, if the federal government essentially disagrees with that, we will take the route that has always been open, which is to undertake the direct cleanup ourselves and then bill Exxon for the price, for the cost."
211,MR. UTLEY:  Congress should just send them the bill or the government should send the bill?
212,"Mr. REILLY:  That's, that's right."
213,(End videotape)
214,"MR. GREGORY:  Preliminary estimates say it will cost billions of dollars to clean up the BP spill now in the gulf.  And while the government is assisting in those efforts, the Obama administration has made it clear that BP will be responsible for all of the cleanup costs."
215,And we'll be right back.
216,(Announcements)
217,"MR. GREGORY:  That is all for today.  We'll be back next week.  Happy Mother's Day to mine, to yours, and especially to my Beth.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday:  a critical moment in the future and direction of the Supreme Court.  What role will she play?  The president's nominee Elena Kagan has started to make the rounds on Capitol Hill.  This morning, only on MEET THE PRESS, two of the key players who will decide whether Kagan becomes the next justice, Democratic member of
the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York; and the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
    "
1,"Then, our political roundtable weighs in on the eve of a huge political week in this midterm year.  Key Senate primary battles in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Arkansas; and a special election to fill John Murtha's seat in Pennsylvania.  What is behind the anti-incumbent wave?"
2,"Finally, a look back in our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE.  Thirty-nine years ago, where the debate stood about nominating a woman to sit on the high court."
3,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
4,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
5,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Twenty-six days after the BP oil rig explosion in the Gulf, another attempt to stop the massive oil leak failed yesterday as BP tried a procedure to siphon oil to a ship.  But the pipe connection didn't work.  This as federal officials sought assurances from BP that it will live up to its promise to cover individual compensation claims. With us to discuss this and a host of other issues Washington is now confronting, New York Senator Chuck Schumer."
6,Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
7,SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  Glad to be back once again.
8,"MR. GREGORY:  The president spoke about BP, he spoke about the oil spill on Friday, and he got mad."
9,SEN. SCHUMER:  He did.
10,MR. GREGORY:  This is what he had to say.
11,"(Videotape, Friday)"
12,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  I know BP has committed to pay for the response effort, and we will hold them to their obligation.  I have to say, though, I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle during the congressional hearings into this matter.  You had executives with BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else.  The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn't. "
13,(End videotape)
14,"MR. GREGORY:  He got angry.  So now what should the government be doing, Senator?"
15,"SEN. SCHUMER:  Well, a couple of things.  First, you have to make sure BP pays for the whole thing.  It's their fault, the taxpayers should not have to be behind this."
16,MR. GREGORY:  Should there be any cap on the damages they pay?
17,SEN. SCHUMER:  I don't believe there should be.  I would...
18,MR. GREGORY:  Because right now it's $75 million.
19,"SEN. SCHUMER:  There's an effort in Congress to remove that cap, and I think it'll pass."
20,MR. GREGORY:  What else would the government do?  Is it a question of more regulation?
21,"SEN. SCHUMER:  I think it is.  Somebody has to look over the oil companies' shoulders.  And the president, to his credit, said that the federal watchdog wasn't a good enough watchdog.  Obviously, something failed dramatically here. There ought to be a fail-safe mechanism and
then there ought to be a backup fail-safe mechanism because if you, if you don't have it, look at the damage. And it can last for years and years and years, and it also changes all the politics.  You look at a climate change bill, it's going to be harder to get one done given the
oil spill, given that drilling off the coast was part of the compromise."
22,"MR. GREGORY:  And--right.  And the president was for that compromise, now that's been tabled.  But look at our NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, what it found about offshore drilling.  It is still very popular.  Sixty percent say they support it.  And yet, the politics are bad on this now."
23,"SEN. SCHUMER:  Well, you have to come up with assurances of people that this wouldn't happen again.  Now, you know, just before this happened people would come in who were for offshore drilling and say nothing bad has happened in the Gulf, at least, for 30 or 40 years.  Can't say that anymore, and it changes the balance.  And my guess is gradually those
poll numbers will reflect that. Americans want to be independent to foreign oil.  That's right.  It's killing us both economically, foreign policywise, and everything else to take people--countries like Iran and Venezuela that hate us and make them rich.  So everyone is now looking
anew at domestic sources of energy production.  Clean energy would be the priority, but people are looking at others--nuclear, offshore, things like that.  And that's going to continue.  But people want to make sure that if we're going to do it, it's going to be a lot better and a lot
safer than what happened in the Gulf."
24,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me turn to the nomination of Elena Kagan to be the next Supreme Court justice.  Here she is back in 1993 in the committee room. She worked, of course, for Senator Biden, who was chairman at the time. There she is.  And she had--she saw it up close, and she had some pretty direct things to say about it.  This was an article she penned for the University of Chicago Law Review, during which she said, in recent hearings--""If recent hearings lacked acrimony, they also lacked seriousness and substance.  ...  When the Senate ceases to engage nominees in meaningful discussion of legal issues, the confirmation process takes on an air of vacuity and farce, and the Senate becomes incapable of either properly evaluating nominees or appropriately educating the public."" You've met with her.  With that in mind, do you think she is prepared to reveal more than she might otherwise about her legal views and philosophy?"
25,"SEN. SCHUMER:  Yeah.  I think that's the right thing to do.  I said that when there were Republican nominees from George Bush, and I believe it with Democratic nominees.  These hearings should not be a farce and should not be, ""What's your favorite movie or restaurant?"" They should talk about judicial ideology and philosophy.  Obviously, you can't pin--try to pin someone down on what might be an upcoming case.  But knowing how they think, how they reason, what's their view of settled law, these are all very legitimate questions, and the hearings would be much less if they weren't asked."
26,MR. GREGORY:  What do you specifically want to know?
27,"SEN. SCHUMER:  Well, the first thing I want to know is just how she balances things.  What I really like about Elena Kagan is she's a practical person. You know, we have eight justices who were judges above all.  Sometimes when you have people way up there in that rarified ivory
tower, they forget the practical consequences of their decisions on businesses, on local governments, on people.  To have someone practical, someone who ran a big legal business, Harvard Law School--which she ran by all reports very well, $160 million budget, 500 people."
28,"MR. GREGORY:  That's pretty rarified air, though, Harvard Law School."
29,"SEN. SCHUMER:  Yeah, but..."
30,MR. GREGORY:  You say that the judges are living in rarified air.
31,"SEN. SCHUMER:  Yeah, but, you know, it's a lot of practical concerns. One of the things she had to do, which she may have to do on the court, is bring the conservative and liberal factions together.  And both sides said she did a very good job."
32,MR. GREGORY:  But do...
33,"SEN. SCHUMER:  So I want to see how--and I hope, and I--it's my hope and belief, this practical person will help bring the court down to earth a little bit."
34,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, so talk about that.  What, what does she mean for the overall direction of the court?"
35,SEN. SCHUMER:  Well...
36,MR. GREGORY:  Is she a liberal or is she a moderate?
37,"SEN. SCHUMER:  I--look, I think she's--she tends to be a moderate when you look at her writings.  But I think that's less important.  When the president called me and asked me what was the number one criteria for a nominee--this was before he chose Kagan--I said, I think it should be somebody who will be in the majority of five rather than the minority of four; someone who'll have the--not only the intellect--and everyone says she's brilliant--but the force of personality, the practicality to try and create coalitions.  I think a lot of us, at least on the Democratic side, were shocked by the Citizens United case, for instance.  And..."
38,"MR. GREGORY:  Just remind people, this was about political contributions."
39,"SEN. SCHUMER:  This is the case that said unlimited corporate money could flow into our politics undisclosed in any way, and it's really--I mean, the First Amendment's important, but so is the sanctity of our political process, so that the average person has a say.  And I was shocked at this.  Maybe a Kagan on the court could have persuaded a Justice Kennedy that the practical--you know, the abstract notion of First Amendment triumphs everything has a balance, and the balance is the practical effects of that. And my hope would be she would do it, and that's what I'm looking for."
40,MR. GREGORY:  But...
41,SEN. SCHUMER:  I'd like to see someone who would be effective at that.
42,"MR. GREGORY:  As you know, there are liberals who are concerned about her view of executive power, that she might be closer to the Bush administration, frankly, on what the executive can do with regard to a war on terror."
43,SEN. SCHUMER:  Mm-hmm.
44,MR. GREGORY:  And she might actually hold up some views that the Obama administration has put forward with regard to a robust executive power with regard to the war on terror.  Is that a concern?
45,"SEN. SCHUMER:  It's certainly a concern.  It will be an area of questioning. But, again, I think that Elena Kagan, as both brilliant and practical--those are the two watchwords that I would ascribe to her in looking at her record, as I have a little bit, meeting her this week--will sort of come to a balance. I, I like balance.  I don't like judges too far right, but I don't like them too far left.  They tend to want to impose their own views and ideology."
46,"MR. GREGORY:  The Republicans have said she's a blank slate, she doesn't have judicial experience. Take that on. "
47,"SEN. SCHUMER:  She doesn't have judicial experience, but she has a lot of experience, a lot of practical experience.  She's hardly a blank slate. You'll look at all of her writings, she wrote many articles as a professor. What she did when she was working in the Clinton White House,
that's all going to be available--Freedom of Information--to the Kennedy Library--or the Clinton Library has been put forward.  There'll be plenty of information about her.  And this idea that she has to be a judge and has judicial writing, some of our greatest justices had no judicial experience, Justice Marshall, Justice Frankfurter, Justice Jackson. Rehnquist, who many conservatives would consider a great justice, had about as much judicial experience as Kagan has."
48,MR. GREGORY:  Couple of issues in our couple of minutes left.  Terrorism and homeland security funding has become a hot button issue... 
49,"SEN. SCHUMER:  Yes, it has."
50,"MR. GREGORY:  ...for you and for New Yorkers.  Here is the New York Post after the administration said it would cut back some of that funding. ""Obama to New York:  Drop Dead."
51,"""That was the message Team Obama sent - loud and clear - yesterday in slashing anti-terror funding for the city."" You put out a pretty blistering statement as well."
52,SEN. SCHUMER:  I did.
53,"MR. GREGORY:  And we'll put that up on the screen.  ""For the administration to announce these cuts two weeks after the attempted Times Square bombing shows they just don't get it and are not doing right by New York City on anti-terrorism funding."" You say it was cut by 27
percent.  Secretary Napolitano of Homeland Security says, ""Hey, wait a minute.  New York has unused anti-terror funding available to it now."" And you got additional stimulus money to help in this regard.  What's at issue here?"
54,"SEN. SCHUMER:  OK, what, what's at issue is two things.  First, it's changed. We've learned since Christmas, with the Christmas bomber, Abdulmutallab, and, of course, with the attempted--thank God it missed--horrible attempt in Times Square, that: A, New York is really the target.  It's not one of 50 targets; we're the number one target.  And second, that there's a group, Pakistan Taliban, that has the capability of trying to do something.  They came all too close.  And so the funding should change.  Should New York get only 12 percent of the port
anti-terrorism security funding?  You know, Secretary Napolitano points out that not all the money is spent.  That's how Washington works. Bottom line is, a lot of the money hasn't been spent because FEMA, an agency under the jurisdiction of the Homeland Security, hasn't spent it."
55,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator, a lot of people don't like how Washington works. If you haven't spent all the money why do you need more money now? "
56,"SEN. SCHUMER:  No.  OK.  Well, we have spent it, it just hasn't been spent out."
57,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
58,"SEN. SCHUMER:  In other words, when you do a three-year contract to put in radiation detectors, she's saying ""Well, years two and three haven't been spent yet."" That's true.  But they've been accounted for.  And when FEMA, a federal agency, is holding it up, you can't blame--that's true. People don't like the way Washington works and that's an example.  Look,
here's what I think, David.  The president gets it.  He came to New York, he showed responsibility.  What happened here is sort of bureaucrats and bean counters at OMB and maybe Homeland Security were doing business as usual, following through on a formula that had been put in place before December.  We have a new round of anti-terror funding, the largest pot called UASI.  I've asked the administration, I've spoken to the highest levels, to move New York's percentage up from 18 to 25, which is what it was in 2005.  We do that, we can make up for these cuts, and I think the mayor, myself, Peter King would be happy."
59,"MR. GREGORY:  The attorney general, Eric Holder, was here last Sunday. He refused to say whether Khalid Sheikh Mohammed will be tried in New York or not.  You have said this is, this is not a closed question."
60,"SEN. SCHUMER:  It is not a closed question.  I, I think the chances of him been tried--of him being tried in New York are close to zero."
61,"MR. GREGORY:  Does he go to a military tribunal, case closed? "
62,"SEN. SCHUMER:  Well, that'll be a question that they have to decide.  The issue here is..."
63,"MR. GREGORY:  What do you think, though?"
64,"SEN. SCHUMER:  Well, here's what I think.  I think--look, I'm tough on terrorism.  I wrote the federal death penalty law that would give the death penalty to terrorists.  What's the quickest and best way to do that?  And I think we ought to defer to the experts on that."
65,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Final point here is politics.  Look what our poll found about who the voters' preference are for this year election, in terms of Republican or Democratic-controlled Congress.  Even split, 44/44."
66,SEN. SCHUMER:  Right.
67,MR. GREGORY:  The Republicans have come way back here.  How about job approval for Congress?  Not so good.  Seventy-two percent disapprove in our poll.  Should Democrats be concerned about this going into November? 
68,"SEN. SCHUMER:  Of course we should, and that's why we have to focus, number one, on the issue that Americans care most about--jobs and the economy.  And we are doing that.  The stimulus, which was unpopular at first, now, if you look at the polls, is getting more popular.  It's having its effect. Financial reform, good strong financial reform will have its effect.  And let me tell you this, the American are generally optimistic.  The reason the numbers are so low is because, for the first time, I think, in this recession, unlike the other nine post-World War II
recessions, Americans said, ""We're never going to get out of this."" If by Labor Day they start seeing light at the end of the tunnel, not that we're there yet, but, ""Ah, I can see where we're going to get there and get out of this and be back to the good old optimistic, prosperous America,"" we're going to do a lot better than people think.  And that's what the numbers seem to indicate economically are going to happen.  Job growth and everything else is up."
69,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Specter, win or lose in the primary?"
70,SEN. SCHUMER:  I bet he wins by a little.
71,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Schumer, thank you as always."
72,SEN. SCHUMER:  Nice to talk to you.
73,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Joining us now from Louisville, Kentucky, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell."
74,"Senator, welcome back to the program."
75,"SEN. MITCH McCONNELL (R-KY):Good morning, David."
76,"MR. GREGORY:  I'd like to begin with the Kagan nomination.  You have questioned her qualifications, suggesting correctly that she does not have judicial experience, she's never been a judge.  And yet, back during the ill-fated nomination of Harriet Miers by President Bush, you were on the floor of the Senate and you said the following, ""She will bring to the Court a lifetime of experience in various levels of government at the highest levels of the legal profession.  ...  She is well qualified to join our Nation's highest court."" She wasn't a judge either, and yet you were for her."
77,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, I think we learned from the Harriet Miers nomination that when you're a friend of the president and you don't have any judicial experience, it makes it important to make, to make sure that you're not just going to be a rubber stamp for the administration.
Really, we've had plenty of Supreme Court justices who have not had judicial experience who've done an outstanding job.  It just raises a red flag.  Frankly, I'm a good deal more troubled by two other things. "
78,"Number one, the, the case that Chuck Schumer mentioned, the Citizens United case, which was a blow for the First Amendment, a very important free-speech case.  Solicitor Kagan's office in the initial hearing argued that it'd be OK to ban books.  And then when there was a rehearing Solicitor Kagan herself, in her first Supreme Court argument, suggested that it might be OK to ban pamphlets.  I think that's very troubling, and this whole area of her view of the First Amendment and political speech is something that ought to be explored by the judiciary committee and by the full Senate."
79,"Secondly is the issue of the military recruitment at Harvard.  She took the position that Harvard should not allow military recruiters at the law school, later supported that position in a decision in the--in a, in a case in the court system that ended up with the Supreme Court ruling 8-to-nothing against the position that she took.  I think these are two areas that need to be..."
80,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
81,SEN. McCONNELL:  ...explored and will be explored by the committee.
82,"MR. GREGORY:  I, I want to unpack that a little bit, Senator, but let me go back to this issue of qualifications.  Are you then satisfied that she has the level of qualifications to be on the Supreme Court?"
83,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, look, I think that's what we go into in the hearings. There'll be lots of records that'll be reviewed from her time at the Clinton administration, from her time at Chicago Law School, at Harvard Law School. We need to let the process play out here, an orderly process, a fair process, not a rush to judgment."
84,"MR. GREGORY:  But don't you think a lot of people look at Washington and say, ""This is the kind of politics that I hate."" Here you were, you stood up for Harriet Miers despite the fact that she was a friend of the president.  You stood up for her despite the fact she didn't have judicial experience, but when it comes to a Democratic nominee you say, ""Oh wait a minute, these are real problems here that have to be explored."""
85,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Look, David, the Republicans have treated Supreme Court nominees a lot better than the Democrats have.  I can't think of a single Supreme Court nominee by a Democratic president who's been treated the way Robert Bork was, the way Clarence Thomas was, the way Sam Alito was, who was filibustered by the president, the vice president, the Democratic leader and the chairman of the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I've never filibustered a Supreme Court nomination."
86,MR. GREGORY:  And do you think there's any impediment to Elena Kagan being confirmed this time around?
87,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, what I think we need to do is to find out what her record is.  That's why--the hearings are not a sham.  They're serious hearings.  So the record will be developed before the Judiciary Committee, and then the members of the committee and, subsequently, the Senate will have an opportunity to tell us how they feel about it. "
88,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's go to this--the other concern that you raised about her position about the military.  So she's dean of Harvard Law School, she opposes military recruitment on campus because of the anti-discrimination policy that, that she was supporting with regard to the prohibition against gays and lesbians serving in the military.  Do you think that position makes her a radical with regard to her views in the military?"
89,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, you left out the most important point, and that was that the law, the Solomon Amendment, required that military recruiters be allowed on campus or the university give up their federal funding. So I think a more appropriate response might have been to
follow the law.  I think it's something we're going to look into at the committee because the decision was apparently made, ""We'll take our chances on federal funding by not allowing those recruiters at Harvard Law School."""
90,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But they did, of course, have access to students through other military groups and, and veterans groups associated with campus. But my question is, do you think, as some Republicans have suggested, that she's got radical views about the military, or do you
think that's an overstatement and unfair?"
91,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Look, I don't know, all we know is the issue with regard to the Solomon Amendment.  And I think the committee ought to look into it. I--this--the record is yet to be developed."
92,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me turn to the issue of the BP oil spill, which the president was quite angry about after the appearance by CEOs on Capitol Hill this past week, including the CEO of BP.  You heard Senator Schumer say there ought to be more effort on the part of the government to look over the shoulders of the oil companies.  What do you say?"
93,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, look, we're all angry about it.  This is a--an environmental disaster of gargantuan proportions, but the president's spent a whole lot of time pointing the finger at, at BP--and you should point the finger at BP and the other companies involved in it.  We're
also interested in knowing what the administration did.  Was the Mineral Management Service a part of this administration that approved this site? It also approved this spill response plan.  What kind of oversight did the administration provide during the course of the drilling?  There are plenty of questions that need to be answered, and there'll be adequate time for that.  But the administration's involvement in this will be a big part of the inquiry.  In the meantime, we need to do everything we can to stop this spill."
94,"MR. GREGORY:  What about the issue of legitimate claims, as BP said, that it will honor?  Do you think that the cap for damages should be higher now, higher than $75 million, as you heard Senator Schumer say they would propose?"
95,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, the danger in that, of course, is that if you raise the cap too high, there will be no competition in the Gulf and you'll leave all the business to the big guys like BP.  What BP has said they need to be held to, which is they're going to pay for this.  They ought to pay for it, and they will pay for it.  But the danger of taking the cap too high is that you end up with only massive, very large oil producers able to meet that cap and produce in the Gulf.  And look, we can't walk away--and the president's not suggesting this either--from
offshore drilling.  As horrible as this is, it's important to remember that we get 30 percent of our oil from the Gulf and, if you shut that down, you'd have $14 gasoline."
96,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me move on to Kentucky politics, something I'm sure you're thinking about this week.  This is the race that you've been engaged in, the Senate primary between the secretary of state of Kentucky, and that, of course, is Trey Grayson, against Rand Paul, who's
got support from Sarah Palin and from the tea party movement.  And right now, Senator, as you know, it is Rand Paul's to lose.  He's up double digits.  And The Washington Post had this headline this past week, and that is ""The old Kentucky reign:  Who will join McConnell in the Senate? Depends on how much voters like McConnell."" You have really put yourself out on a limb on this race ,and the voters appear to be rejecting that. Is this a referendum on you and the establishment Republican Party?"
97,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, it reminds me of when the president went in to Massachusetts, a state he carried by 26 points, and tried to elect the candidate running against Scott Brown.  I don't think anybody seriously thinks the president won't carry Massachusetts next time.  This is a race between two non-incumbents.  There's been a lot of discussion about incumbency.  We'll find out maybe something about incumbency Tuesday in Arkansas and, and Pennsylvania, where we have two Democratic incumbents in serious races.  We don't have incumbency on the line in Kentucky.  We have two non-incumbents running for an open seat.  One of our senators is supporting one candidate, and one is supporting the other candidate. Whichever one ends up running the best race, I guess, will be the nominee.  But most importantly, in terms of the Kentucky scene, we will have a unity rally at the state party headquarters on--next Saturday to get behind the winner and win in November."
98,"MR. GREGORY:  You're not going to be in Kentucky on election night, are you?"
99,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Well, the Senate is in session on Tuesday, but I'll be at state headquarters next Saturday with the winner, and we'll all lock arms and go out and win in November."
100,"MR. GREGORY:  But you're, you're suggesting that your efforts to help Trey Grayson have not paid off, you expect Rand Paul to win?"
101,"SEN. McCONNELL:  No, I don't know who's going to win.  I hope it will help. I think Trey Grayson would be a stronger candidate in November. But I expect Kentucky's going to be in a pretty Republican mood this fall, and I'm optimistic that whoever wins the primary will be the next senator from Kentucky."
102,"MR. GREGORY:  What does it say, though, about the strength of the tea party movement?  However large and vast that movement is, it certainly has been in evidence in the support for Rand Paul."
103,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Yeah, I think so, and it's an important movement in the country, and I think it's really going to help us in November."
104,"MR. GREGORY:  President Obama has made the point and begun to frame the argument for the midterm race, and he did it at a campaign event the other night, about how Republicans will have to hear from Democrats, how Democrats will run in the fall.  This is what he said."
105,"(Videotape, Thursday): PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  Now, after they drove the car into the ditch, made it as difficult as possible for us to pull it back, now they want the keys back. No!  You can't drive!  We don't want to have to go back into the ditch.  We just got the car out.  We just got the car out."
106,(End videotape)
107,MR. GREGORY:  How do you respond to that?
108,"SEN. McCONNELL:  Sounds like he wants to run against George Bush one more time, doesn't it?  I mean, look, the administration's--the, the American people have taken a look at what this administration's done.  They're running banks, insurance companies, car companies.  They nationalized the student loan business, which will kill 31,000 private sector jobs. They've taken over health care.  They're in amount--they're about to do to financial services what they did to health care.  Their appointees over at the FCC are trying to take over the Internet. They've doubled the national debt in the last--will double the national debt in the next five years, triple it in 10.  The American people are appalled by this. And in your own NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, Peter Hart, the Democratic pollster who participates in that, and I'm paraphrasing, basically said the American people have made up their mind and it'll be very, very hard for the Democrats to change their mind.  We're looking at a midcourse correction here.  We'd like to see the president be the moderate he campaigned as.  And I think the only way that's going to happen is that the American people send us more Republicans in the House and Senate to
move this administration back to the middle in what I hope is the last two years of its only term."
109,"MR. GREGORY:  Before you go, Senator McConnell, if the economy continues to produce jobs--573,000 between January and April--it's a projected 1.72 million jobs created over a full year.  If that happens, do you think President Obama deserves credit?"
110,"SEN. McCONNELL:  What we know right now is there have been 3,000 private sector jobs lost when the president--since the president came to office. We know they've added 260,000 government jobs.  We know the only boomtown in America is Washington because they're exploding government employment, hiring new government workers by borrowing money from our grandchildren. That isn't likely to change by November.  I hope the economy is beginning
to come back, but it'd have to come back a long way for anybody to believe the stimulus plan, which was sold to us to keep unemployment at 8 percent, has worked. Unemployment is at 10 percent.  We're not making a whole lot of headway so far."
111,"MR. GREGORY:  Leader McConnell, we'll leave it there.  Thank you very much."
112,SEN. McCONNELL:  Thank you.
113,"MR. GREGORY:  And up next, a Super Tuesday of sorts, in just two days, as we've been talking about.  Our roundtable weighs in on all the big races and what's behind this anti-incumbent wave:  Jonathan Alter, Peggy Noonan, Mike Murphy, and Bob Shrum.  Plus, our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE. Nearly four decades ago, the debate over nominating a woman to the Supreme Court, only here on MEET THE PRESS."
114,(Announcements)
115,"MR. GREGORY:  Heated Senate primaries, a key special election in Pennsylvania and a growing anti-incumbent wave.  Our roundtable weighs in on the eve of a political week that could define the midterm elections, after this brief commercial break."
116,(Announcements)
117,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  And we're back with our roundtable:  author of the new book ""The Promise:  President Obama Year One,"" Newsweek senior editor Jonathan Alter; Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan; Republican strategist Mike Murphy; and Democratic strategist Bob Shrum."
118,"Welcome to all of you.  Good to have you here.  I keep--for the first couple of weeks, I keep welcoming people to the new digs.  So welcome to the new digs."
119,MR. BOB SHRUM:  Yeah.  They're great.
120,"MR. GREGORY:  Thank you, thank you.  It's good..."
121,MS. PEGGY NOONAN:  Yeah.
122,"MR. JONATHAN ALTER:  As the kids would say, this is a sweet set."
123,"MR. GREGORY:  Yes, yes."
124,"MR. MIKE MURPHY:  I don't know if we're all very excited about HD.  I can tell you, I've been worried all week."
125,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah, it's HD.  Right, right, it's a good thing."
126,So much to talk about.  Let's start with the president's standing right here as we get set for this mini super Tuesday coming up this week. Here's his job approval according to our new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll.  He's at 50 percent.
127,"And, Mike Murphy, I spoke to somebody close to the president this week who said, ""Hey, look, he gets 53 percent of the vote in 2008, he's now at 50 percent.  Not bad for everything that's going on."""
128,"MR. MURPHY:  Well, not good enough.  I think if the election were held today the Democrats would lose the House.  It's not held today.  The question is the trend from now till November.  But there's no question there's a pushback in the country against the Obama policies.  He ran as a moderate, he's governed as a liberal.  Now the forces of the right are pushing back.  It's why his numbers are in decline.  You can argue about the slope of the decline.  He's not up, but his policies are up for referendum, and they're, I believe, going to have a pretty bad midterm."
129,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Bob Shrum, what may contribute to that thinking is that, among seniors, among other activists types, the enthusiasm gap between Republicans and Democrats, that's in the Republicans' favor, which, in a midterm election year, is a problem."
130,"MR. SHRUM:  Yeah, I think that's likely to change, although not certain. And I agree with Mike, by the way, that if the election were held today, it'd be a problem.  Although there's a new AP poll this morning that shows Democrats suddenly back with a five point generic lead in the
congressional race.  I think that's because people may be beginning to feel the effects of the economy.  Jobs are everything here.  These job numbers really matter.  I wouldn't yet call the midterm.  I actually think--you know, we saw it last summer, we saw an August that was
transformative.  And I think that in the era we live in, things can move very fast, and I think perceptions here can move very fast."
131,"MR. GREGORY:  It is interesting, Jonathan Alter, and, and you write about this in the book ""The Promise""--I'll hold it above the banner there--""President Obama Year One,"" what we're seeing in our poll is something that we've seen for a while with President Obama.  People like him personally, they're not as sold on his policies.  So his policies are less popular than he is as the man.  You write in your book about that in terms of what started to happen for him in the course of year one.  We'll put it up on the screen: ""Little by little in the second half of the
year,"" this is his first year, ""Obama lost much of his connection to the American people.  Some voters felt he wasn't expressing their anger; others just thought he was talking at a level over their heads.  He could be folksy, but he didn't have Bill Clinton's gift for making complex subjects fully accessible.  In fact the two presidents' relationships with the public were the inverse of each other. During the late '90s Americans didn't trust Clinton personally, but they trusted his ability to deliver for them on pocketbook issues; in 2009 the public trusted and
admired Obama personally, but not his approach to the issues that affected their lives."""
132,"MR. ALTER:  You know, change is hard, David, and a lot of people weren't quite ready for all the change that they got in year one of Obama's presidency.  And he delivered on a lot of it.  They are only now beginning to feel the effects of that change.  When Barack Obama came to
office, the economy was losing 740,000 jobs a month in January of 2009. We're now adding about 250,000 jobs a month.  So there has been a turnaround.  We have prevented another Great Depression from taking place.  But, as Mitch McConnell pointed out, unemployment is still 10 percent.  Americans vote and respond to the policies of the White House based on their pocketbooks in large measure. So what will happen this year will depend on what--politically, will depend on what happens economically."
133,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Peggy, they also respond to leadership qualities, to people they have some affinity for.  You experienced that with Ronald Reagan. Is there a parallel here?"
134,"MS. NOONAN:  I, I am struck by the number of people who say they kind of like him but they kind of don't like his policies.  When you--when you add up those who say, whatever they think of him, they don't like his policies, there are more who don't like his policies.  However, he stays roughly at 50 percent in, in approvable--in, in approval and I think likability.  I think one thing that has changed for him in the past few months is that he has finally gotten off health care, which made him--made his position very delicate and was very hard for him, and, I think, helped him lose some of the center.  That's some of the three points that he's lost in the polls.  It's interesting to me also that the president seems different from his party.  His position seems stronger than that of the Democratic Party.  He stays around 50, they stay around whatever; Congress is about 20, the party itself about 40.  That's interesting to me, and probably has implications.  I'm not sure what they are."
135,"MR. GREGORY:  But what are the implications, Bob?  Because there is a big, a big difference there."
136,"MR. SHRUM:  Well, at the, at the risk of offending Peggy, the first thing I want to say is I think the arc of this presidency is going to be a lot like the arc of Ronald Reagan's.  In 1982, Reagan--people still liked him.  He had a terrible job approval rating, it went down to 35 percent. But as the economy got better, the Democrats who salivated to run against
him in 1984 found out how wrong they were.  I think what Obama has done--it's the other thing Jonathan has written--he understood--he actually took a lesson from Ronald Reagan."
137,MR. ALTER:  Mm-hmm.
138,"MR. SHRUM:  Go early and go big.  Get the big changes done no matter how hard they are, and then ride the economic recovery up.  I think, in the end, 2012 is not going to be a good year for Republicans.  2010 I think depends on whether or not people begin--whether reality, economic reality catches up with the perception of recession.  There are some beginnings of signs that it is."
139,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let's talk about some of the big issues now on the president's plate.  Elena Kagan nomination, of course, for the Supreme Court."
140,"And, Mike, I'll have you respond to something that Bob wrote in his column this week.  We'll put it up on the screen.  ""Kagan may be the best choice for the Supreme Court--although there are dissenting liberals who doubt it.  But undeniably, one reason she was picked was to circumvent the clash and smash of a bitter partisan time.  We can already see that the strategy won't work fully; she'll be confirmed, but only after a faux battle against her make-believe radicalism."""
141,"MR. MURPHY:  Well, I'm shocked, shocked..."
142,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah, yeah."
143,"MR. MURPHY:  ...that Bob's in support and expecting a faux battle against
her."
144,MR. SHRUM:  You probably actually agree with that.
145,"MR. MURPHY:  Well, here's what I think.  I think since the Democrats ran the assassination campaign of politics against Bork, we've had two levels of Supreme Court nominations.  One, the real kind of politic of the issues of the court, where they are as lawyers or judges or, or
academics; and second, the political show.  And they've got the votes to confirm her.  He, he picked a center-left justice that he thought he could get through.  I'm not a big fan. I'm a conservative.  That said, I think they've got the votes.  The politics of this will be secondary to the economy and big things, but I think Republicans are going to score some points on this military recruiter issue. That's going to strike a chord with people that--I think it reinforces the Obama view of a certain elitism, more connected to the Harvard faculty lounge than Main Street."
146,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
147,"MR. MURPHY:  And the idea that the Harvard Law School's a place where you don't want military recruiters is going to be very troubling, I think, to a lot of people."
148,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Jonathan, the argument was she wanted everybody to be able to serve in the military.  How is that anti-military?"
149,"MR. ALTER:  Yeah, you know, she, she took a very strong line against the ""Don't ask, Don't tell"" policy.  She was basically just continuing the policies of her predecessors.  I agree with Mike, I think this is going to come up.  This whole question of Obama's relationship with the
military is something that I write a lot about in my, my book, and there was actually a showdown between the president and the Pentagon brass over perceptions that there was insubordination during the debates over Afghanistan..."
150,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
151,"MR. ALTER:  ...last fall.  And I--and the president pushed back very hard. And this all--none of this came out at the time, but this is something that, in the Afghanistan section in my book, I focus on.  I think that there, there is some tension there that remains, that by and large he gets along pretty well with the military, but that this kind of issue could rub some of that raw."
152,"MR. GREGORY:  The, the issue also of Bork, which Mike brought up, Peggy, if you go back to those hearings, he was known for being an outspoken judge."
153,MS. NOONAN:  Yeah.
154,"MR. GREGORY:  He came into those hearings and he said what he thought. Shows you what good that did him in terms of what the opposition was against him. But here, with Kagan, you do have particularly liberals who want to explore her views about executive power and whether she is closer to the Bush administration when it comes to how--what, what power the executive has over detainees, over who gets, you know, their day in court, etc."
155,"MS. NOONAN:  Mm-hmm.  Look, I think that since the Bork hearings it has been very hard for young lawyers who want to go forward in the judiciary to realize anything but this.  If you are colorful, if you are interesting, if you are forthcoming and share your thoughts and philosophy and views on the way up, when you get to your confirmation hearing for the court, they will put a noose around your head, hanging you with every interesting thing you've ever said. I, I happen to think the Senate Judiciary Committee has not done a good job of vetting and bringing out the thoughts of, of Supreme Court nominees for a long time. I think they should change.  Let those nominees be forthcoming, let them speak.  And I think this whole sense we've got that you can't say anything interesting on the way up ought to just go away.  Oliver Wendell Holmes today would not be allowed on the U.S. Supreme Court because he said such fabulous, interesting things. "
156,"MR. SHRUM:  He wouldn't have, he wouldn't have to have a confirmation hearing, Peggy, because they didn't have them in those days."
157,"MS. NOONAN:  Well, fair enough.  Fair enough.  But we do have them now, and they ought to summon thought, and they ought to respect individuality and taking a different view, and creativity, frankly."
158,"MR. SHRUM:  Well, look, here's what should..."
159,MS. NOONAN:  Those things shouldn't kill you.
160,MR. SHRUM:  Go ahead.
161,"MR. ALTER:  I was just going to say that Barack Obama, during the Sotomayor preparations, he actually said in the Oval Office, ""I would not be confirmed for the Supreme Court with the system that we have right now."" That's how out of control the whole vetting process has gotten."
162,MS. NOONAN:  Yeah.
163,"MR. SHRUM:  But we have to understand--here's what's going to happen--and this isn't going to change much, as Peggy might wish it to or I might wish it to--the senators are going to ask their questions.  The nominee, as usual, is going to give carefully rehearsed answers.  They're going to be as noncontroversial as possible.  Then the process is going to move forward.  I, I do quarrel with the rewriting of history to explain this. Robert Bork's real problem, in my view, was that he had condemned the Supreme Court decision outlawing the poll tax; he had condemned the one person, one vote decision; he had condemned the decision striking down restrictive housing covenants; and he had called the public accommodation section of the Civil Rights Bill in 1964..."
164,MR. MURPHY:  This is an illustration...
165,"MS. NOONAN:  Bob, yeah, this is like what happened."
166,MR. SHRUM:  ...disgraceful.  He was out of the mainstream.
167,MS. NOONAN:  That is one way to put it.
168,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  My final point on this, because I don't want to talk politics."
169,"MS. NOONAN:  Yeah, yes."
170,MR. MURPHY:  This is an illustration of what's gone wrong but also what's going to happen.
171,MR. SHRUM:  Yeah.
172,"MS. NOONAN:  Yes.  Senator, I disagree!"
173,"MR. MURPHY:  Obama's going to get his judge, and Republicans are going to scorn the politics."
174,MR. SHRUM:  But no one who...
175,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
176,"MR. SHRUM:  ...no one who says the poll tax ought to be upheld is going to be confirmed, is my point."
177,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, let me, let me get in here."
178,MS. NOONAN:  Sit him down and talk to him and summon his thoughts.  Don't just make accusations...
179,"MR. SHRUM:  I, I agree."
180,"MS. NOONAN:  ...and say, ""You're over."""
181,"MR. SHRUM:  Well, these weren't accusations, these were facts."
182,MS. NOONAN:  The accusations against Bork came within 45 minutes of the announcements of his nomination.
183,MR. SHRUM:  Yes.
184,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  I'm going, I'm going to get in, I'm going to get in here because..."
185,"MR. SHRUM:  And he confirmed them, actually."
186,MR. GREGORY:  ...we're not going to relitigate Bork.  We are going to talk about the politics of the moment.
187,"MR. SHRUM:  No, but the right loves to use it."
188,"MR. GREGORY:  But I want to talk about--Mike, before we talk about some of the key races coming up on Tuesday, I want you to frame what we're seeing here.  And the big question is, what is driving--who or what is behind this anti-incumbent wave?"
189,"MR. MURPHY:  It's pretty simple, and it's, it's in both parties.  People think Washington doesn't work.  They think a politician, many of them voted for in the last presidential election to fix Washington, didn't fix it.  They think the government's out of control, and they think politicians are incompetent. So this is an election year where it's a really bad idea to be a professional politician in either party.  And I think on Tuesday, we're going to see Arlen Specter, and I won't go through all the races yet..."
190,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.  Well, I'll do that.  You set me up nicely."
191,MR. MURPHY:  Yeah.
192,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk about--let's start in Pennsylvania.  Senator Specter, he flipped, of course, and is now a Democrat, used to be a Republican.  He's up against Congressman Joe Sestak in a race that is close, although there's a new poll that's come out that has Sestak ahead by 7.  This is one of the big thrusts of the argument that Sestak is making.  He did it in an ad that he's put together against Senator Specter."
193,"(Videotape, Joe Sestak political ad)"
194,"MR. JOE SESTAK:  I'm Joe Sestak, the Democrat.  I authorized this message."
195,SEN. ARLEN SPECTER:  (From video) My change in party will enable me to be re-elected.
196,"Narrator:  For 45 years, Arlen Specter has been a Republican politician."
197,"PRES. GEORGE W. BUSH:  (From video) Arlen Specter is the right man for the United States Senate.  I can count on this man.  See, that's important.  He's firm ally."
198,Narrator:  But now...
199,SEN. ARLEN SPECTER:  (From video) My change in party will enable me to be re-elected.
200,"Narrator:  Arlen Specter switched parties to save one job--his, not yours."
201,(End videotape)
202,"MR. GREGORY:  As a practitioner of the dark art of politics, you have to like that ad."
203,MS. NOONAN:  Oh!  Oh!
204,"MR. MURPHY:  It has a good message, which is he's only half a Democrat and he's all a politician.  I think he's done."
205,MR. GREGORY:  You think he's done.  Bob?
206,"MR. SHRUM:  I think he is, too.  Look, he thought his whole card was Obama. This ad, which is quite brilliant, reassociates him with Bush.  He has one hope, and that is the safety net of Philadelphia.  Ed Rendell, when he was running for governor in that primary, lost almost every
county in Pennsylvania in 2002, ran up huge margins in Philadelphia. "
207,"MR. GREGORY:  And I've been told the governor still thinks he'll, he'll eke it out, like Senator Schumer said, ""by a little."""
208,"MR. SHRUM:  Well, but did you see..."
209,MR. MURPHY:  I wouldn't want to be around.  I'd be running for the tall grass on this.
210,"MR. SHRUM:  But did you see when, when Schumer said, ""by a little"" bit, he kind of looked down at the table."
211,"MR. ALTER:  Can I say something nice about Senator Specter?  He's an ornery guy, not the most popular guy in the Senate.  He's going to lose. But in the stimulus debate, when it really counted, what did he hold out for?  A doubling of funding for cancer research.  Now, maybe because he's a cancer survivor, I'm a cancer survivor, this takes on more importance for us.  But I think there are a lot of viewers out there now who are going to thank Senator Arlen Specter for that in the years ahead. "
212,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk about Arkansas, another tough race for an incumbent, and that's Blanche Lincoln.  She's up against Bill Halter, the lieutenant governor.  Now, she's ahead what looks like to be 10 points. The issue here is she's not running at 50 percent.  She needs 50 percent for a runoff here."
213,"And as the National Journal showed, Peggy, on its cover, that Lincoln is learning that being a centrist in the Senate is offering her little refuge from attacks on both the left and the right.  A centrist Democrat right now is being pressed and squeezed pretty hard because of health care and other issues."
214,"MS. NOONAN:  Yeah.  I remember a few months ago, she had a, a meeting, the Senate Democrats had a meeting with President Obama, and she stood and almost pleaded with him to understand the position of centrist, moderate Democrats."
215,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
216,"MS. NOONAN:  And he kind of stiffed her.  He kind of said, ""I'm doing what I'm doing."" She's in trouble.  One gets the impression it's not going to work for her.  Again, she is an incumbent.  She does not have the part of her party that needs to be on fire, on fire."
217,"MR. GREGORY:  She's being attacked from the left by the unions, Bob."
218,MS. NOONAN:  Yeah.
219,"MR. SHRUM:  Right.  Yeah.  Look, she has to get to 50 percent to avoid a runoff.  She is being attacked from the left.  But her other problem is that--and this is sort of spreading throughout Arkansas and the electorate--she has a very bad approval/disapproval, she runs much more
weakly than Lieutenant Governor Halter does against the respective Republican nominees.  And I think that if she goes into a runoff, which is likely, she'll probably lose it."
220,"MR. GREGORY:  Just a couple more to get through here.  Talk about Kentucky, Mike Murphy, we did it with Senator McConnell.  You've got Trey Grayson and Rand Paul.  Rand Paul has the strength of that tea party behind him here, and McConnell has not been able to help the
establishment candidate."
221,"MR. MURPHY:  Yeah.  It's a classic case of kind of the, you know, the pushback because Grayson is not a Washington politician, but he's a local politician.  I think Paul will probably win that primary.  He's ahead in the polls.  I think he'll win the general, too, but it'll be a little closer, Grayson's the tougher general election candidate."
222,"MR. GREGORY:  Pennsylvania 12, this was John Murtha's seat, and a lot of people are watching this, it pits right now, Tim Burns, a Republican, against Mark Critz.  This is a more culturally conservative, blue-collar southwest Pennsylvania district.  A Democrat, Murtha, has been there for years."
223,"But, Jonathan, both parties looking at this to say either they're slowing the momentum if the Democrat wins or Republicans are saying, ""Hey, this is the kind of seat that will spell the end of the majority for Democrats."""
224,"MR. ALTER:  Well, we could see the return of what they used to call the ""Reagan Democrats."" You know, these are lunch-bucket, white working-class Democrats who have--went back with--they did go for Obama, not in as great numbers as they went for John Kerry, but they, they could conceivably trend back to the Republican Party.  Something that the Democrats have going for them, though, I think we're seeing in, in Blanche Lincoln's race, where she is moving against Wall Street, and that's also resonating.  So just beating up on government is no longer
cutting it when people are now increasingly mad at not just Wall Street, but the oil companies and big business in general. "
225,"MR. GREGORY:  Final thing I want to look at, Peggy and Mike, John McCain in a tough re-election battle.  He's got a primary challenger in J.D. Hayworth, and the issue is the politics of immigration.  This is the ad that he is running.  Watch this."
226,"(Videotape, McCain political ad)"
227,"SEN. JOHN McCAIN:  (To sheriff) Drug and human smuggling, home invasions, murder..."
228,"SHERIFF PAUL BABEU (Pinal County, Arizona):  We're outmanned.  Of all the illegals in America, more than half come through Arizona."
229,SEN. McCAIN:  Have we got the right plan?
230,"SHERIFF BABEU:  Plan's perfect.  You bring troops, state, county and local law enforcement together."
231,SEN. McCAIN:  And complete the dang fence.
232,"SHERIFF BABEU:  It'll work this time.  Senator, you're one of us."
233,(End videotape)
234,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet it was John McCain who, who sponsored comprehensive immigration reform."
235,"MS. NOONAN:  Yes.  Oh, the ""dang"" was the worst part of that.  Complete the dang fence.  It--I, I don't know its impact.  It, it seems desperate. "
236,But...
237,MR. ALTER:  Did he have to round up and deport his principles in this race? It's just kind of a sad comment. 
238,MR. MURPHY:  But let me--let me...
239,"MR. GREGORY:  Thirty seconds, go ahead."
240,MR. MURPHY:  It's a lawless frontier because of the failure of the Obama administration to protect the American border.
241,MS. NOONAN:  Yes.
242,MR. MURPHY:  People are getting killed and murdered.  It has become really bad in Arizona.  This came...
243,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  This goes back before Obama, though, to be fair."
244,"MR. MURPHY:  It--but it's gotten, it's gotten worse and worse."
245,MS. NOONAN:  But it has gotten worse.
246,"MR. MURPHY:  It's a crisis the Obama people have failed to address. They've had a year to do something, they've done nothing.  McCain's standing up for his constituents there."
247,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think we'll see comprehensive immigration reform or is that not ripe yet?
248,MR. MURPHY:  No.  Democrats don't really want it.
249,MR. SHRUM:  No.  But let me tell you what's going to happen.
250,MR. GREGORY:  Real quick.
251,"MR. SHRUM:  Republicans are going to campaign against this, they're going to do anti-Hispanic stuff, they're going to make it impossible to win the presidency because they can't win it without 40 percent of the Hispanic vote."
252,MS. NOONAN:  Neither party wants to close that border.
253,"MR. GREGORY:  That's going to be the--that's going to be the last word. Thank you all very much.  We're going to leave it there.  But we're going to continue our discussion with Jonathan Alter in our MEET THE PRESS Take Two Web extra.  You can also read an excerpt from the book, ""The Promise: President Obama in Year One,"" and find updates from me throughout the
week.  It's all on our Web site at mtp.msnbc.com."
254,"Up next, our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE.  A fourth woman could soon sit on the Supreme Court, but 39 years ago, it was a very different story.  We look back at the debate over why a woman was not nominated that time around, after this brief station break."
255,(Announcements)
256,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  And we are back with our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE.  If confirmed, Elena Kagan would become the nation's fourth woman ever to serve on the Supreme Court.  President Reagan appointed the first woman, now retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to the high court back in 1981. Ten years earlier, then President Nixon was tasked with filling two
Supreme Court vacancies.  California Judge Mildred Lillie was under consideration for the second spot; and more than 50 years after women were granted the right to vote, many had hoped a woman would finally get her due."
257,"But on October 21, 1971 the president nominated William Rehnquist for the job.  Later that week, Patricia Roberts Harris, the chair of the powerful Credentials Committee for the Democrats' 1972 convention and a former dean of Howard University Law School, appeared right here on MEET THE PRESS and spoke about why she believed a woman should have been
nominated."
258,"(Videotape, October 24, 1971)"
259,"MS. MARIANNE MEANS:  Mrs. Harris, the Nixon administration indicated that a woman was not picked for the Supreme Court because discrimination in law schools, in law firms has been so great there was such a small pool of talent available.  Is this a valid excuse?  Are there really no qualified women who could have met Mr. Nixon's criteria?"
260,"MS. PATRICIA HARRIS:  I do not believe it is a valid excuse, Ms. Means. The president went to the Department of Justice for one of this candidates, and with--in my direct knowledge there is in that department a superbly well-qualified woman who is head of the appeals and research
section of the criminal division.  Comes to my mind immediately.  And there are many others who are available because of the paucity of women in law, the outstanding women are apparent.  There's Constance Baker Motley in, in New York.  And I think that there are outstanding candidates who might well have been picked for that spot."
261,(End videotape)
262,"MR. GREGORY:  Speaking this week at Kagan's nomination ceremony, President Obama said he relished the prospect of having three women on the high court for the first time in history, saying the bench would ""be more inclusive, more representative, more reflective of us as a people than ever before."" And we'll be right back."
263,(Announcements)
264,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  That's all for today.  We'll be back next week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday:  The politics of anger and the anti-Washington wave.  What do the results of super Tuesday mean for the president and his party come November?  Joining me, the two men charged with getting members of their party elected to the Senate, campaign chairs, Republican John Cornyn and Democrat Robert Menendez.
    "
1,"Also, the view from one candidate who took on an incumbent and the White House and won, Pennsylvania Congressman and Democratic Senate candidate Joe Sestak."
2,"Then, our political roundtable weighs in.  What's happened to the political center?  Without it, can anything in Washington get done?  With us, Tom Friedman of The New York Times, Bob Woodward of The Washington Post, Paul Gigot of The Wall Street Journal, and NBC's Andrea Mitchell."
3,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
4,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
5,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Super Tuesday 2010 unleashed a new power player within the Republican Party.  But by week's end, Kentucky Senate candidate Rand Paul, son of former presidential candidate Ron Paul, found the spotlight a little too hot, canceling his appearance on this program and raising doubts about his prospects for the fall."
6,(Videotape)
7,"Unidentified Woman:  The next U.S. senator from Kentucky, Dr. Rand Paul."
8,(End videotape)
9,"MR. GREGORY:  A political novice, Kentucky ophthalmologist Rand Paul took on the Republican establishment and won big.  He won nearly 60 percent of the vote and put the tea party on the political map."
10,(Videotape)
11,"DR. RAND PAUL:  I have a message, a message from the tea party, a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words, ""We've come to take our government back."""
12,(End videotape)
13,"MR. GREGORY:  Paul didn't mince words either.  His belief in limited government prompted questions about his views on civil rights after he told the Louisville Courier-Journal he opposed the portion of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibiting discrimination by private businesses.  He
was pressed further on ""The Rachel Maddow Show."""
14,(Videotape)
15,"MS. RACHEL MADDOW:  Do you think that a private business has a right to say, ""We don't serve black people""? "
16,"DR. PAUL:  I'm not in, I'm not in, I'm not in--yeah--I'm not in favor of any discrimination of any form ...  but I think what's important about this debate is not getting into any specific gotcha on this, but asking the question, ""What about freedom of speech?"" What I was asked by the
Courier-Journal, and I stick by it, is that I do defend and believe that the government should not be involved with institutional racism or discrimination or segregation in schools, busing, all of those things, but had I been there, there would have been some discussion over one of
the titles of the civil rights."
17,(End videotape)
18,"MR. GREGORY:  Paul ignited a controversy with his extreme views, and under pressure from both sides of the political spectrum, he backtracked the next day, issuing a statement saying he would not support repeal of the Civil Rights Act.  But he added, ""The federal government is out of control, and those who love liberty and value individual and states rights must stand up to it."" But by week's end, Paul again drew criticism for his views, this time by accusing the president of too harshly criticizing BP for its role in the Gulf oil spill."
19,(Videotape)
20,"DR. PAUL:  What I don't like from the president's administration is this sort of, you know, ""I'll put my boot heel on the throat of BP."" I think that sounds really un-American in his criticism of business. "
21,(End videotape)
22,"MR. GREGORY:  Dr. Paul wondered publicly Friday where his honeymoon was, and later, citing exhaustion and an unwillingness to answer any further questions about his stand on civil rights and the role of government, canceled his appearance here.  But there are questions about his
principles left unanswered, like whether his belief in limited government means he opposes, say, the minimum wage, the ban on child labor laws, or workplace safety rules. Perhaps the bigger question is whether this fresh new face in politics is now a weaker candidate than he was Tuesday night."
23,"I want to turn now to our guests, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Senator John Cornyn, and his counterpart, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Senator Robert Menendez. "
24,"Welcome, both of you, this morning to MEET THE PRESS."
25,SEN. ROBERT MENENDEZ (D-NJ):  Good to be with you. 
26,SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX):  Thank you.
27,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Cornyn, Rand Paul's spokesman sent a statement to MEET THE PRESS this morning indicating that he didn't want to be on the program because he wanted to avoid the liberal bias of the media, and I wonder what your view is, whether you think this is liberal bias that's ensnared him this week or whether it's the articulation of his own views about the limited scope of government that had senior Republicans in the party telling him to avoid the national spotlight?"
28,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, Dr. Paul's new to running for public office, and I think it's Bob's experience, I'm sure my experience, that you see novice candidates occasionally stumble on questions.  I think he's clarified his position.  But I think he's done the right thing.  As much fun as this is, David, to be here with you, I think he needs to be talking to the voters back in Kentucky, the people who actually will be able to cast a ballot on whether he's elected as the next United States senator or not. "
29,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, I--obviously being here is not as important as the larger point, which is don't you think this is fair game, questions about his views about the limit and the scope of government? "
30,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, I do think that's a, a fair topic, and I'm sure you'll be hearing extensively from him and all the candidates over the next six months. But the fact of the matter is Rand Paul's leading his opponent in the, in the general election by 25 points."
31,MR. GREGORY:  You don't think he's a weaker candidate today than he was Tuesday?
32,"SEN. CORNYN:  He's leading by 25 points; I have to let the numbers speak for themselves.  But I think we will have a, a discussion about the role of government in our lives.  There are too many Americans, or many Americans, I should say, who believe that government has simply gotten too aggressive, it spends too much, it borrows too much, and we've had too many government takeovers.  I think he will speak directly to that, and I think people will respond favorably."
33,MR. GREGORY:  Do his views concern you?
34,"SEN. CORNYN:  I don't know what all his views are.  I've watched this exchange, but the fact of the matter is I think he's doing the right thing by talking to the people of Kentucky and..."
35,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator, my--you have heard his views, and, and it's not as if he hadn't thought this out.  He's got very specific views about even the Civil Rights Act.  He took issue with only one of the titles in the Civil Rights Act, so it's not as if this was some sort of ambush.
He's thought a good deal abo ut this; he's articulate about what he believes.  You've heard that.  Do you agree or disagree? "
36,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, he's clarified his views that he's opposed to any kind of discrimination period, and I applaud him for clarifying that view.  I just think that every time you have a citizen who decides to run for public office who's not a professional politician that occasionally
they're going to stumble.  Sometimes their philosophy, when you start to articulate it and carry it to its logical end, they have to come back and say, ""Well, you know, what""--we just have temper that with experience. "
37,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but his, but his view is that private businesses should not be subject to a government mandate even about discrimination. Is that something you agree with or do you think that's beyond the pale of, of mainstream conservative views?"
38,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, David, what I heard him say is he supports the Civil Rights Act.  He clarified his views, and I think that's--that should be the end of it."
39,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Menendez, your take on what you've seen in the last few days."
40,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  Well, it seems to me that this is an example of what's happening to the Republican Party across the country, beating the Republican establishment, but it's the mainstream losing to the extreme. Clearly, with Rand Paul, here's someone who, you know, as you have already cited, questions elements of the Civil Rights Act as it relates to the private sector, says that President Obama's comments about making BP responsible in the oil spill is un-American, wants to end farm subsidies across the country, including in Kentucky.  I'll take our matchup with Attorney General Jack Conway, who's a crusading attorney general--rooted out Medicaid fraud--against someone who clearly is in the extreme, even questions the, the Americans with Disabilities Act.  So I think this is an example of what's happening to the Republican establishment across the country, the establishment being beaten by extreme candidates whether it be here or in Florida or, as you see, surging in Colorado and Nevada."
41,"MR. GREGORY:  The--his views, Dr. Paul's views about the limits of government also has to do with the deficit, and that's really the thrust of what he's run on, his concerns and other tea partiers concerns about the debt. This is what he said at a unity event in Kentucky yesterday."
42,(Videotape)
43,DR. PAUL:  We have an annual deficit of nearly $2 trillion.  Interest alone on the debt is $383 billion.  I think there is a day of reckoning coming.  I don't want that day of reckoning to involve chaos as we're seeing in Greece.
44,(End videotape)
45,"MR. GREGORY:  That is a potent message.  There's a reason why he won so big, and your party is in charge of the White House and Congress.  Isn't this a liability, government spending and the debt, for Democrats this fall?"
46,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  Well, we'll have to remind, David, the, the public that Republicans left this president and this Democratic majority with two wars raging abroad unpaid for, a couple of trillion dollars in tax cuts unpaid for, a new entitlement program unpaid for; and what we had to do is inherit the economic mess they gave us and try to stop us from going into a--very well a possibility of a depression and move forward from losing three-quarters of a million jobs, when Barack Obama took office, for the first quarter of each month--for the first quarter of 2009 to
gaining nearly 300,000 jobs  last month, from negative GDP growth to positive GDP growth.  So it seems to me, including, you know, having Republicans run away from their own proposition of a bipartisan commission to deal with the national debt, something I voted for, something the Republican sponsors actually ran away from."
47,MR. GREGORY:  Senator:
48,"SEN. CORNYN:  There they go again blaming it on George Bush.  I don't know when this administration, when the Democratic leadership that got the majority in November 2008 are going to take responsibility for the 23 percent increase in the national debt since President Obama was sworn into office.  Under the president's own budget, our debt-to-GDP ratio will be up to 90 percent by 2020, 90 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  Greece is at a 115 percent.  So it's easy to see that unless we take our foot off the accelerator when it comes to spending and debt, if we don't do the sort of fundamental reform of entitlements, cut back on spending and do the same sort of budget scrub that every family, every small business has had to do during this recession, that we're going to be heading off a financial cliff.  And I don't see the administration taking their foot off the gas at all.  I see them stomping the gas and going even further to grow the size of government and spend and debt."
49,"MR. GREGORY:  The, the debate about the debt will continue."
50,"I want to ask you, Senator Cornyn, one other question, though, about the tea party and its impact.  This is how The Economist reported it this week in the context of Dr. Paul.  We'll put it up on the screen.  ""The impact of the tea-partiers is a decidedly mixed blessing for the Republicans.  On the one hand, the party benefits from the passion and dollars this widespread grassroots mutiny against big government is able to inject into local campaigns.  On the other, they are in danger of pushing the Republicans well to the right of the mainstream.  Dr. Paul,
like his father, is a genuine radical who believes in paring government down to the bone."" You have the fundamental conflict for the tea party, which is how is a movement predicated on limiting the size of government actually going to govern within the government?  Tea party and the Republicans, is it an asset or a liability?"
51,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, the tea party, tea party movement and libertarians like, like Dr. Paul don't believe in no government.  They believe in limited government, smaller government, government that lives within its means.  The fact is, as a New York Times poll said recently, that 57 percent of independents, the people who actually win elections, or, or tip the balance of elections, sympathize with the tea party movement. Our friends on, on the Democratic, the Democratic Party have tried to marginalize these people and claim like they're somehow less than patriotic Americans, when these are folks who perhaps have not gotten involved in politics before, who've gotten off the couch, who've gone to town halls, who've gone to these rallies to express their view that that spending has got to stop."
52,"MR. GREGORY:  But it's fair--I mean, even in the case of, of Dr. Paul, I mean, you would admit, wouldn't you, it is a--it's a question, and, and I don't know the answer, where they think the line is in terms of the role of government?  In terms of regulation?"
53,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, that..."
54,"MR. GREGORY:  In terms of what laws the government should pass?  I mean, you would, you would admit that Dr. Paul is still opaque on this point? There's a lot of questions that he has invited."
55,SEN. CORNYN:  And that's what the next six months of the campaign's for.
56,MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Yeah.
57,"SEN. CORNYN:  I think what we've seen in the time that President Obama has been in office, in the time that Democrats have basically run Washington, is an antipathy toward the private sector and the job creation capacity that only they can provide.  They..."
58,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we're going to come back to this with our guests in just a moment.  I want to take a moment now to turn to Pennsylvania's Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate, Congressman Joe Sestak. "
59,"Congressman, welcome to MEET THE PRESS."
60,"REP. JOE SESTAK (D-PA):  Good to be here.  Thanks, David."
61,"MR. GREGORY:  Nice to have you here.  You had a very important victory in Pennsylvania, taking on Senator Arlen Specter, the incumbent, and you won. And when you spoke on election night, this is what you said. "
62,"(Videotape, Tuesday)"
63,"REP. SESTAK:  This is what democracy looks like, a win for the people over the establishment, over the status quo, even over Washington, D.C.!"
64,(End videotape)
65,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman, you sound like the ultimate outsider.  The only problem is you are a congressman.  OK?  You were running against the establishment."
66,REP. SESTAK:  Ah.
67,"MR. GREGORY:  You voted for TARP, for the bailout.  You voted for the president's stimulus plan.  You voted for the president's healthcare plan. Exactly which establishment are you not part of, that you're running against?"
68,"REP. SESTAK:  You know, I--31 years in the Navy, as you know, when I came to Washington, I was kind of taken aback that that type of accountability that I'd learned from my actions in the U.S. Navy seemed to be absent down here in Washington, D.C.  Look, somebody had torpedoed our economy. We were sinking. We had to caulk the holes.  We were hemorrhaging jobs. It's not about big government or small government, it's about effective government.  Somebody took the referee off the football field up there on Wall Street, they let them play roulette with the savings of the seniors in my district.  I sit there, and to what is to Wall Street a market correction now means young couples can't afford to send their children to
education.  I ran about accountability for one's actions, and I think that's not..."
69,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Congressman..."
70,REP. SESTAK:  ...pretty absent down here.
71,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman, the question I asked you is you have supported all the major elements of the Obama agenda."
72,REP. SESTAK:  Yes.
73,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet you, in that sound bite, were running as an outsider. Are you not part of the establishment that you are railing against?"
74,"REP. SESTAK:  Oh, I did vote for those because they were needed.  But as John F. Kennedy once said, sometimes the party asks too much.  And when they did something that I didn't agree with because it didn't help Pennsylvania working families, I'll stand up to the party.  That's what I did.  It doesn't mean whether you're part of an establishment or not. It's whether you stand up for what's right."
75,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, which, which element of the Obama agenda that was his priority did you stand up to?"
76,"REP. SESTAK:  Oh, I did--I honestly think that this president has done great, good things.  But I don't think we've gone far enough in terms of helping small business.  My party has to recognize business is a good word when you have small in front of it.  And to give a 15 percent tax credit to small businesses for every new payroll job that's created, we could, according to Economic Institute, soak up five million of the eight and a half million unemployed in two, two and a half years.  In short, we need to do even better than what we've done.  And as was mentioned earlier, the market's good. There's really good private markets out there.  We just need fair rules.  And before the rules kind of favored Wall Street, not those in state."
77,"MR. GREGORY:  Are you--would you like to see more tax cuts, is that what you're suggesting?"
78,"REP. SESTAK:  For the small businesses, without a question.  Look, for far too long, like the Senate did, they literally voted that large corporations that invest in a foreign factory get a tax credit.  On Wall Street they said, ""Forget about any rules out there, go ahead and
gamble."" So what I'm for is for effective government.  And there should--if there are going to be tax credits, and I do believe in them, they should be where the majority of Pennsylvanians work.  The majority of them work in small business."
79,MR. GREGORY:  But...
80,REP. SESTAK:  That's the real engine of the economy.
81,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  But, Congressman, you're a Democrat, and I fully expect that you will campaign for the Obama agenda come the fall. Is that your plan?"
82,"REP. SESTAK:  I'm campaigning for whatever is needed to take care of the working families of Pennsylvania.  I would like President Obama's support, and he said in his phone call to me, yes.  But at the end of the day, I ran because I didn't agree with a deal that was made that I didn't think would help Pennsylvania over the next six years.  I respect the establishment, but when they're wrong I think you have to stand up and say..."
83,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But what you stood up to was your opponent, which is not terribly courageous given that that's what you do in politics. What I'm asking is whether you are an Obama Democrat who supported stimulus, who supported health care, who's with him on all the major elements of his agenda. Are you or are you not an Obama Democrat?"
84,"REP. SESTAK:  I've always described--I've always described myself as an independent-thinking person who believes in Democratic principles.  Those are the same principles this president believes in.  But if I think they're doing something that isn't right in accordance with the
principles that help, help families in Pennsylvania, I'll stand up just like I did then.  I'm a pretty pragmatic guy, you know.  I come from the military, everybody has health care. And the dividends that accrue to our nation are immense.  We don't even, we don't even promote you above a certain rating or rank unless you have an education, an associates college degree.  I'd say pretty much those are kind of principles that give dividends to our nation.  Imagine a work force that's healthy and educated, that can compete with China and India.  That's the kind of
focus and Democrat I am."
85,"MR. GREGORY:  What, what job were you offered to stay out of a primary race by the administration?"
86,"REP. SESTAK:  It's interesting.  I was asked a question about something that happened months earlier, and I felt I should answer it honestly. And that's all I had to say about it because anything beyond that gets away from what we just spoke about."
87,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
88,"REP. SESTAK:  What are the policies that are really going to help people
who've been slammed by economy..."
89,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, but you've campaigned on transparency.  It's part of the politics.  You talked about standing up to the White House when they'd fielded a candidate--made a deal with Arlen Specter.  So isn't it in the--in the spirit of transparency, were you offered a job by
the administration?  And what was it?"
90,"REP. SESTAK:  I learned, as I mentioned, about that personal accountability in the Navy."
91,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
92,REP. SESTAK:  I felt I needed to answer that question honestly because I was personally accountable for my role in the matter. 
93,MR. GREGORY:  What's the answer?  What's the job you were offered?
94,"REP. SESTAK:  And--but anybody else has to decide for themselves what to say upon their role, and that's their responsibility. "
95,"MR. GREGORY:  Yes or no, straightforward question.  Were you, were you offered a job, and what was the job?"
96,"REP. SESTAK:  I was offered a job, and I answered that."
97,"MR. GREGORY:  You said no, you wouldn't take the job.  Was it the secretary of the Navy?"
98,"REP. SESTAK:  Right.  And I also said, ""Look, I'm getting into this..."
99,MR. GREGORY:  Was it the secretary of the Navy job?
100,REP. SESTAK:  Anything that go--goes beyond that is others--for others to talk about.
101,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me just take the last couple minutes to talk about some elements of how you'll campaign.  What specifically would you advise the president to do with regard to tackling the debt?  What painful choice would you advocate as a United States senator, either on the spending side or the tax side?"
102,"REP. SESTAK:  There's three major areas.  First, pay as you go, which we know President Clinton used to give us three budget deficits, was throw one out--and you need to look at your weight to see where you got through, where, if you want a new program, you got to cut another program.  We have that, but there's too many caveats to that.  And we need to do that on the mandatory discretionary side.  Right now we're only looking at the mandatory spending side.  Second, health care.  The largest increase over the next 50 years in our budget is Medicare, Medicaid.  Can we do it?  Sure.  And as we have two programs that are in
this new healthcare bill that begins to reward and incentivize for quality of care, not quantity of care--that is that if somebody is, after a heart operation like my father, left after three days and they missed that he had a staph infection, just another fee, they weren't penalized
for it."
103,MR. GREGORY:  Can I just get a very specific answer to the question...
104,"REP. SESTAK:  Third, revenues."
105,"MR. GREGORY:  ...which is what specific, painful choice would you advocate as United States senator to deal with the debt?"
106,"REP. SESTAK:  Close those tax loopholes.  All right?  Carried interest for Wall Street upwards of $80 billion to $100 billion a year, they get taxed at 15 percent.  Eighty billion dollars for tax loopholes for oil companies that literally have record profits, $352 billion a year that's
not collected in taxes from small businesses and individuals, never mind corporations. But also, as Secretary Gates, I stood up and said he was right when he said, ""Wait a minute, we don't need the F-22."" And I have two plants in my district that provided parts for that plane.  But what he's trying to do to transform the military is also absolutely needed."
107,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We're going to leave it there.  Congressman Sestak, good luck in the fall campaign."
108,REP. SESTAK:  Thank you very much.
109,MR. GREGORY:  Thank you very much for being here.
110,"Let's turn back now to the senators, the campaign chairs."
111,"And, Senator Menendez, I will begin with you.  Talk about Pennsylvania. The White House backed Senator Specter.  That didn't work.  Assess this race now going into the fall."
112,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  Well, you've seen that you have a Navy admiral who really has an independent view, one that fights for Pennsylvanians in terms of their jobs and economic opportunity, vs. someone who spent a decade on Wall Street as a derivatives trader and ultimately spent another six years in Congress, you know, defending the interests of Wall Street. I'll take that matchup on any day.  And I think Pennsylvania 12, the congressional election that took place, the only election which there was a Republican against a Democrat.  And that election showed very clearly, in a district that John McCain won, in a district that is far more conservative, where Republicans went after Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi and our candidate talked about jobs and economic opportunity, he won. And I think you're going to see that same race, type of race, played across the country."
113,"MR. GREGORY:  Is President Obama, who declined to come in for Senator Specter at the very end because the view was he was going to lose, is he an asset or a liability for Democratic candidates this fall? "
114,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  I think the single biggest thing that President Obama can do to help Democrats and particularly the country, as we move into midterm elections, is what he has been doing, righting this country from huge job losses to job gains, going from negative domestic growth to positive domestic growth, tackling some of the fundamental things that my
colleagues on the Republican side, you know, let fester for eight years. I mean, the reason we had double-digit increases in health care, Republicans did nothing.  The reason that we had excesses on Wall Street is because..."
115,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, let's..."
116,SEN. MENENDEZ:  ...they didn't permit a cop on the beat.
117,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's, let's stay focused to Pennsylvania.  Senator Cornyn, your view."
118,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, I think Pennsylvania, Colorado, Arkansas, Kentucky are--demonstrate on the Democrat side basically a fight between the party of big government--the Democratic Party--and the people who are running against those establishment Democrat candidates who are in favor of really, really big government--people like Mr. Conway, people like Mr. Romanoff out in Colorado, people like Mr. Sestak, who basically, as you pointed out, David, voted 98 percent with Nancy Pelosi and the president agenda's, which is extraordinarily unpopular.  Sixty percent of the people--I think it's 56 percent nationwide--believe the healthcare bill that my friend Mr. Menendez and my friend Mr. Sestak support, they want to repeal it because they realize we can't afford because it raises  premiums, raises taxes, and cuts Medicare in order to create a new entitlement program."
119,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me, let me ask about another interesting race here of, of a candidate who's gotten in some trouble, and that is Connecticut--the attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, and his Vietnam-era service.  This was the headline in The New York Times.  The ""Candidate's Words Differ From His History."" This was an article that pointed out several examples where he had claimed that he had actually served in Vietnam when he had not.  This was one example back in March of 2008."
120,"(Videotape, March 2, 2008)"
121,MR. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL:  We have learned something very important since the days that I served in Vietnam. 
122,(End videotape)
123,"MR. GREGORY:  And, in fact, he dealt with that a few days later, this week, rather, at a press conference, where he dealt with the story and what he meant by all of that.  Was it a misstatement or something more? This is what he said."
124,"(Videotape, Tuesday)"
125,"MR. BLUMENTHAL:  Now on a few occasions, I have misspoken about my service, and I regret that, and I take full responsibility.  But I will not allow, I will not allow anyone to take a few misplaced words and impugn my record of service to our country."
126,(End videotape)
127,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Menendez, is it a stretch to believe that this was just a misstatement?  Do you know anybody in the military who's not extremely carefulable--careful about speaking about their service and whether it occurred during wartime or not?"
128,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  Look, I think the attorney general, surrounded by veterans who had his back, as he's had their back over 20 years, clearly said, ""I misspoke."" As a matter of fact, the, the article that originally came out about him, in the same video, if you look at that video later
on, he says, ""I did not serve in Vietnam."" So the bottom line is here's someone, however, who did ultimately enlist in the Marines, in the Reserves."
129,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator, I'm sorry."
130,SEN. MENENDEZ:  Here's someone who spent...
131,MR. GREGORY:  My--but my question is very clear.
132,SEN. MENENDEZ:  Here's someone who spent six months in...
133,"MR. GREGORY:  I'm sorry, sir, my question is very clear.  Do you think people really believe it was a misstatement?  Don't you know anybody in the military who's very careful about distinguishing their military service during wartime or not?"
134,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  Well, if you look, if you look, listen to the very veterans..."
135,MR. GREGORY:  I know what he said.
136,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  If you listen to the very veterans in Connecticut, they said, ""We knew that he did not serve in Vietnam, and we did not believe that he was deceiving us."""
137,MR. GREGORY:  Did he try to mislead people? 
138,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  These are, these are the veterans of Connecticut.  But, listen, I'll, I'll take a crusading attorney general who did serve in the Marines vs. John's candidate who--Linda McMahon--who actually operated the World Wrestling Entertainment which became a dirty business.  She tried to intervene in an investigation on a narcotics issue in, in that industry.  She peddled violence to kids, let wrestlers have their bodies ultimately be damaged, all for the purposes of making money.  I think that that contrast in this election is one that will take."
139,MR. GREGORY:  Senator?
140,"SEN. CORNYN:  We still have a primary in Connecticut so I don't know who our nominee's going to be, but what the public is looking for are candidates and office holders that they can trust and that have integrity.  And, unfortunate, I think Mr. Blumenthal has damaged his reputation as somebody you can trust by misrepresenting his record.  And the, the only worse thing, David, I think is then coming on and saying ""Oh, I misspoke"" after you've been caught red-handed.  It's as if he shot himself in one foot, then reloaded and shot himself in the other."
141,"MR. GREGORY:  Before you both go, I want to talk about the politics of..."
142,SEN. MENENDEZ:  I guess that applies to Rand Paul too.
143,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to talk about the politics of, of immigration.  This week the Mexican president met with President Obama, had a state dinner. He also spoke to a joint session of Congress in which he was rather critical of the law in Arizona, a tough anti-immigration law, saying it was an invitation to racial profiling.  Sarah Palin posted something on her Facebook page which seems to speak for a lot of conservatives who are defending the Arizona law. She wrote this:  ""Arizonans have the courage to do what the Obama administration has failed to do in its first year and a half in office - namely secure our border and enforce our federal laws.  And as a result, Arizonans have been subjected to a campaign of baseless accusations by the same people who freely admit they haven't a clue about what they're actually campaigning against."""
144,"Senator Menendez, you have pushed this administration to pass comprehensive immigration this year.  Is that possible in this political climate?"
145,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  Well, I hope if John and some of our colleagues on the Republican side join us in an issue that is critically important to both the national security, the national economy, and about stopping the exploitation of millions of people, yes.  But if Republicans, who have
basically taken an absolute opposition to seeking comprehensive immigration reform continue to do so, you can't have states like Arizona say Washington hasn't acted.  And I've said to--you know, I've mentioned various times that the governor of Arizona should speak to her two U.S.
senators and to her Republican colleagues in the Senate to make sure that they join us in an effort to make sure we control the borders and, at the same, time deal with the 12 million people in this country."
146,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Senator Cornyn, it was Senator McCain, who is now talking about, you know, has an ad about completing the fence on the border.  He and Senator Kennedy championed comprehensive immigration reform, as did President Bush, and it was the  Republican Party's own party who turned away from it."
147,"SEN. CORNYN:  David, I wish that the president of the United States, the president of Mexico, the attorney general, and the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security would have done what anybody can do with Internet access, which is to download a copy of the Arizona bill and read it for themselves. It expressly bans racial profiling.  And, frankly, the people of Arizona have had to step up in the absence of a sensible immigration reform plan, starting with border security.  The president's budget is essentially a flatline in terms of additional boots on the ground and additional resources to, to secure the border, with drug wars raging in Mexico--23,000 people have died in Mexico since 2006.  This is having a spillover effect in the United States, and we've got to secure the border as a predicate to dealing with the larger issue."
148,"MR. GREGORY:  Would you support comprehensive immigration reform this year if it included protections for the border, as it did when the Bush administration tried it, as well as a path to legal status for those workers who are here?"
149,"SEN. CORNYN:  Well, the Bush administration made leaps and bounds working with a bipartisan Congress to improve border security, but it still is not secure.  There's a lot we need to do."
150,MR. GREGORY:  So you don't think it happens this year?
151,"SEN. CORNYN:  I think Rahm Emanuel, as I understand, has advised the president that this is not something they should do, because he's called it the third rail of politics.  The president's got to take the lead..."
152,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator, will he?"
153,SEN. CORNYN:  ...and then we'll work with him.
154,MR. GREGORY:  Will the president do it?
155,"SEN. MENENDEZ:  Well, well, certainly.  If, if, if--the president said he wants to do this, we just need some Republican support here.  Look, they've talked about--Jon Kyl and John McCain, have talked about rounding up all 41 Republican senators in opposition to comprehensive immigration reform.  Well, they can filibuster then.  There's no way to move forward. This is too important an issue for the national economy, for the national security.  I'd rather have people know who was here to pursue the American dream and pay their taxes than to keep them in, in the shadows."
156,SEN. CORNYN:  David...
157,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we're going to let--I'm going to make that the last word.  A stalemate for this morning on that.  We'll continue to follow it. Thank you both very much for being here."
158,SEN. MENENDEZ:  Thank you.
159,SEN. CORNYN:  Thank you.
160,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up next, a packed agenda in Washington, as you can hear. But can anything get done if there's no middle ground?  Insights from our roundtable:  Tom Friedman of The New York Times, Bob Woodward of The Washington Post, Paul Gigot of The Wall Street Journal, and NBC's Andrea Mitchell, only here on MEET THE PRESS."
161,(Announcements)
162,"MR. GREGORY:  A packed agenda in Washington, but can anything get done if there's no middle ground?  Our political roundtable weighs in on super Tuesday's election results right after this brief commercial break. "
163,(Announcements)
164,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Joining us now, our political roundtable, associate editor of The Washington Post, Bob Woodward; chief foreign affairs correspondent for NBC News and host of MSNBC's ""Andrea Mitchell Reports,"" none other than Andrea Mitchell; editorial page editor for The Wall Street Journal, Paul Gigot; and New York Times columnist Tom Friedman."
165,"Welcome back to the program all of you.  Welcome back.  Welcome, I should say, to our new surroundings, if you haven't been here before."
166,MS. ANDREA MITCHELL:  It's beautiful.
167,"MR. GREGORY:  Tom Friedman, the curious case of Dr. Rand Paul; a political force this week, a force for the tea party, and someone who is outspoken in his views, who, by the end of the week, had Republicans quite nervous.  As you heard Senator Cornyn say, this is a--the issue
with these novice candidates, they go out there and they make mistakes. Is he a weakened candidate?"
168,"MR. TOM FRIEDMAN:  Well, it sure feels like it to me.  I think when you, you know, come out against the 1964 Civil Rights Act, that's not a growth position.  Now, maybe in his state or maybe in the tea party, but I, I, I don't think that's something that you're going to build a national campaign around, you know.  So, yeah, it really gets to the fact of--I think you tried to press all the senators on this, really, David, is you're--you want to cut back government.  I'd like to cut back government too.  Just tell me which service do you want to take away?  Is it police, fire, Army, you know?  I think we--that's a serious discussion to have, smaller government.  But to say we want smaller government, less government intrusion, tell me what you want to take away.  I think what's really difficult about this moment and why it requires much smarter leadership is we need to cut some taxes right now and raise some taxes,
OK?  We need to cut some services now and invest in new services now. That's what's so difficult and challenging about this moment. And if you're just for one or the other, I don't think you have the answer for this moment."
169,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, Paul Gigot, what interests me about Rand, Rand Paul, kind of the larger issue is this question of the role of government. What role should government be playing?  And I think that this administration is making an argument that government has a big role to play, an important role to play, and that it can't just be about the freedom of the markets and that sort of thing.  Your take? "
170,"MR. PAUL GIGOT:  Well, he's wrong about the, he's wrong about the Civil Rights Act, and he shouldn't get into debate about 46-year-old settled law that is a--there's a consensus and support of in this country.  But to Tom's point, Rand Paul is actually somebody who's willing to be more specific about what he'll cut.  He's willing to take on Medicare.  He's willing to say, ""I'm, I'm willing to raise the retirement age,"" or ""I'm willing to reform Social Security."" He'd be willing to take on some of those questions in a more forthright way.  And the mistake he made was to take the focus, political focus, away from all that and say..."
171,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
172,"MR. GIGOT:  ...""Oh, well, we're--you know, let's have a libertarian seminar about a 46-year-old law."""
173,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, and, Andrea, to the point, I mean, it was curious to me that his folks are now talking about liberal media bias and all the rest when this was somebody who did what I think journalists like, which is he said what was on his mind.  And he has well-developed views, and he spoke about them. You can agree with him or disagree with him.  He's willing to talk about them in some depth.  And yet, now it's somehow about liberal bias."
174,"MS. MITCHELL:  Look, he announced his candidacy on the Rachel Maddow show, so he wasn't venturing into a hostile area.  He was articulating his views.  He's a libertarian.  He was being philosophical about that and true to his beliefs. If he is true to his beliefs, why is he running
for the United States Senate? If he does not believe in the purer sense that the government should intrude on businesses' rights to discriminate against gay people, against people who have, have, who have disabilities, who need wheelchair access, if he doesn't believe in that, why does he think he can go to the Senate and pass laws? That's what senators do, they legislate."
175,"MR. BOB WOODWARD:  Yeah.  Yes, but forget--I mean, don't forget that the anti-government message is really, really strong.  There was a man named Ronald Reagan who ran on it in a very, very powerful way.  And if you look at some of the things Reagan said in his various campaigns, they echoed this.  It turns out Reagan didn't cut government; he did cut taxes.  And, you know, now people look at that very fondly.  So..."
176,"MS. MITCHELL:  But let me just push back on that, because I did an interview with Jim Baker this week who, without knowing exactly what Rand Paul had said, made that same point, the Reagan analogy.  Ronald Reagan was a pragmatist.  He ran on some things in 1980, but as we all covered him in the years, he raised taxes when he had to, the cement broke around his feet.  What Rand Paul is saying, if he's going to be true to his beliefs, is very different.  It is much more rigid. "
177,"MR. WOODWARD:  No, but, but he's a pragmatist too.  He declined to come on the show because he knew he would be asked about that instead about the anti-government message."
178,"MR. GREGORY:  Touche, Bob Woodward.  I want to--can I just--I want to put two things on the screen and, and, Paul Gigot, have you break them down a little bit.  There were two kind of--trying to find the meaning of Tuesday.  This was a cartoon that we liked, Mike Smith from the Las Vegas Sun, it was in the USA Today.  And you got a couple of guys sitting at the bar, one says, ""Everyone's mad at me, my wife...my kids...my boss."" The other guy says, ""Hey, it could be worse.  You could be an incumbent."" So there's anti-incumbency, Paul Gigot, but there's also this, this old Jim Hightower quote, who was this populist commentator who said, ""There's nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead Armadillos."" So did we see the breakdown of the political center and, and, and a real problem for incumbents Tuesday?"
179,"MR. GIGOT:  Of course, we saw both of them.  I think you're seeing on the--President Obama has governed so far to the left that I think he's driven Republicans to the right.  Republicans, as you saw in Utah where they didn't re-elect--didn't get--put on the ballot Bob Bennett, is that, ""We don't want somebody who's going to cooperate with this agenda, we want somebody who's going to stop it."""
180,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But the irony, Paul, is you say that he governed from the left, what has the tea party most animated is TARP, which was a Republican creation."
181,"MR. GIGOT:  Well, no, no, no, no, there's no question about it.  And, and yet it has evolved..."
182,MR. GREGORY:  Certainly.
183,"MR. GIGOT:  ...to now bail out the insurance companies and the auto companies, and it's, it's gone well beyond its original purpose to save the financial system.  But I think the, the way--you cannot look at the, the polarization of this election without looking at the way this country
has been governed the last two years.  There was a reaction to that. It's a reaction on the right, as I described, but there's a reaction on the left where you see a lot of the labor individuals, labor unions and others, candidates, saying, ""You know what, we don't want moderate Democrats who aren't going to support the president's agenda 100 percent,"" and they're taking that on in Arkansas, they're--the Democrats just lost a seat in Hawaii because their party was split on those grounds."
184,"MR. WOODWARD:  But I don't think these elections have any theme, quite frankly, and I think the politics are very unsettled.  It was Secretary of Defense Gates who recently gave a speech saying--about the military budget saying it's a ""gusher."" There are all kinds of problems out there that I think are going to define the six months that we--before the election.  The, the big one, obviously, is the oil spill... "
185,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
186,MR. WOODWARD:  ...down in the Gulf.
187,MR. GREGORY:  Which I want to--right.
188,MR. WOODWARD:  Where is that going?
189,"MR. GREGORY:  And I want to get to that, I want to get to that right after our break."
190,MR. WOODWARD:  Yeah.
191,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to follow up on one point, though, Tom Friedman, which is when you have such activism on the left and the right, what does that do to the political center and how do you govern in that respect? Bob Bennett, the senator who was defeated in a nominated convention in Utah, wrote this in The Washington Post this morning, ""The tea party movement's ...  two strongest slogans,"" he writes, ""are `Send a message to Washington,' `Take back America.' I know both very well because they were the main tools used to defeat me ... two weeks ago.  ... "
192,"""Yet when the new members of Congress whom these slogans elect in November take office ...  will they stand firmly on partisan sidelines continuing to shout slogans?  Or will they reach across the aisle in the interest of the country?  ...  If they want their movement to be more
than a wave that crashes on the beach and then recedes back into the ocean, leaving nothing behind but empty sand, they should stop the `gloom talk.' These are not the worst of times we have ever faced, nor is the Constitution under serious threat."" Where is the center that actually does something, that actually achieves things in Washington if this is what we're creating?"
193,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  Well, David, it's been decimated.  It's been decimated by everything from the gerrymandering of political districts to cable television to an Internet where I can create a digital lynch mob against you from the left or right if I don't like where you're going, to the
fact that money and politics is so out of control--really our Congress is a forum for legalized bribery.  You know, that's really what, what it's come down to.  So I don't--I, I--I'm worried about this, it's why I have fantasized--don't get me wrong--but that what if we could just be China for a day?  I mean, just, just, just one day.  You know, I mean, where we could actually, you know, authorize the right solutions, and I do think there is a sense of that, on, on everything from the economy to environment.  I don't want to be China for a second, OK, I want my democracy to work with the same authority, focus and stick-to-itiveness. But right now we have a system that can only produce suboptimal solutions."
194,"MS. MITCHELL:  And, in fact, Tom, you're absolutely right.  One case in point, the Financial Regulation Bill, which we can get to... "
195,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
196,"MS. MITCHELL:  ...but Chris Dodd realized that Bob Bennett, with whom he wanted to work, the ranking member on the Banking Committee, was so swept away by his fight back home in Utah that he could not work across party lines, and that there is so much punishment for anyone who works across party lines to try to come up the best solutions so they end up with
things that are not optimal."
197,MR. GIGOT:  We'd all be in jail if we were China for a second.
198,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  No, I--it's--I understand.  I don't want to be China, I want our system to work, though."
199,"MR. WOODWARD:  Congress is not going to enact your fantasies or anybody else's fantasies.  I mean, they, they will--remember now, we were talking about health care being dead 11 or 12 times, they passed it.  So things do happen; there are compromises."
200,MR. GIGOT:  They...
201,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Final thought here on this.
202,"MR. WOODWARD:  Now, you don't like it, but they did it."
203,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
204,"MR. GIGOT:  They go--they--I don't--yeah, that's right, and there are people who want to come in and stop it.  But I would argue that if they elect--you get a Republican Congress, you'll see Republicans and Obama have to do business on something, and these things go in cycles and that's what happened after 1996 when you had a Republican Congress and, and, and president, Democrat."
205,"MR. GREGORY:  We'll take a break here.  I want to come back and talk about how Washington is responding to the Gulf oil spill, what should be done next. Our discussion with our political roundtable continues right after this break station break."
206,(Announcements)
207,"MR. GREGORY:  And we're back to continue our discussion with our political roundtable.  Let's talk about this oil spill that goes on a month now unabated, still we have the, the, the oil gushing.  James Carville, ""the Ragin Cajun,"" lives in New Orleans now, former adviser, of course, to President Clinton and well-known Democrat, critical of the Obama administration.  This is how Politico reported it on Friday, quoting Carville, ""`They are risking everything by this ""go along with BP"" strategy ...' Carville told CNN ...  on Friday.  `They seem like they're inconvenienced by this, this is some giant thing getting in their way and somehow or another, if you let BP handle it, it'll all go away. It's not going away.  It's growing out there.  It's a disaster of the first magnitude, and they've got to go to plan B.'"" Tom Friedman, what, what is that?  What should the government be doing now that it's not doing?"
208,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  Well, obviously, there's a short-term solution and a long-term solution.  Short-term obviously you've got to stay on BP and stay on the situation.  We've got an oil spill, it's, it's about a mile below the surface, it's about 60 to 70 miles offshore, so it's hard to see, OK?  And we don't exactly know precisely what environmental damage it's going to cause, but this is enormous, and it has the potential to be the worst environmental disaster this country's ever faced.  My criticism of the Obama administration is their approach has been ""Think small and
carry a big stick,"" OK?  Hammer BP, put it all on them.  But in terms of thinking about a long-term solution to this, it's been rather imaginative--unimaginative.  David, we're really caught right now, I would argue, between petro-determinists and eco-pessimists.  The eco-pessimists tell us, ""David, Paul, you're dead, you're dead--climate--you're dead, you're, you're--I'll talk to you but you're dead,"" OK?  The petro-determinists tell us, ""Look, we're always going to have to be dependent on oil, little boy, OK?"" Nowhere in the middle is someone who actually believes in America, America's innovative prowess, that over time--there is no short-term solution to this, but our addiction to oil drives down, you know, the value of our dollar, funds people who've drawn a bull's eye on our back, promotes climate change, OK, despoils our environment and having a policy that ends our addiction to oil--it's not win-win, it's win, win, win, win, win. The fact that there isn't a single person, OK, in Congress, really taking this seriously, and the president is playing kind of rope-a-dope with this right now, I find extremely frustrating."
209,"MR. WOODWARD:  It, it, it is a potentially a giant disaster of the--I mean, most disasters come and go.  9/11 came and went, OK.  This continues.  And I, I picked, I picked up your newspaper on Saturday and had half a smile because it said, ""BP steps up its effort,"" and then I read on, ""to criticize others and point the finger at others, and blame everyone."" Where are, you know, why don't they call in Google?  Why don't they call in some of the people who have these great minds to fix it? "
210,"MR. GIGOT:  Because this is a very, very hard engineering problem, a specific engineering problem 5,000 feet underwater.  What does Carville want the, the government to do?  They don't have the expertise to cap this."
211,"MS. MITCHELL:  Well, it's..."
212,"MR. WOODWARD:  Well, Google's not part of the government."
213,MS. MITCHELL:  But they should...
214,MR. GIGOT:  But they don't the expertise to do this either.
215,MR. WOODWARD:  I'm saying get smart people.
216,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But that, but that is the issue."
217,MR. WOODWARD:  You got to do something.
218,"MR. GREGORY:  Who's got the expertise here?  But BP has more expertise than the government does.  Right?  I mean, isn't that the problem?"
219,MS. MITCHELL:  The fact is they said they had a plan when they got the permit.
220,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
221,"MS. MITCHELL:  We have people in government, in this administration as well as the previous administration, in that same division of the Interior Department.  You have a Cabinet secretary very well regarded. He came in, he didn't say to himself, to his team, ""You've had people who
go to jail in this division of the Interior Department who are permitting oil drills offshore. We're about to recommend to the president more offshore drilling,"" which everyone had agreed is a necessary part of a medium-range solution.  Why didn't they first say, ""Let's take this division and shake it out and find out what is going on in there?  What is the relationship between these oil companies and the people giving them the permits?"" They said they had a plan. What is so shocking, I think, to people is that the best scientists, the best minds--you've got a, Nobel laureate who is the secretary of Energy."
222,"MR. GREGORY:  Steven Chu, right."
223,MS. MITCHELL:  Steven Chu.  How can there not be a scientific solution? That's what's so shocking about this.
224,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  Well, you know, what's striking to me, Andrea, is that I think, in again, in the short run, as Paul said, this is a really difficult engineering problem.  And I don't, I don't blame--I blame them for not having better regulated oil companies in the future.  That's something both administrations have done.  Finding--that they haven't found the immediate solution I think is..."
225,MS. MITCHELL:  But they said they had answers for these very risks...
226,MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yeah.
227,MS. MITCHELL:  ...when they answered the question about the permit.
228,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yeah.  to me, though, it's really the longer..."
229,MR. GIGOT:  They did and they failed.  Those answers failed.
230,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  It's, it's, yeah.  Those, yeah."
231,"MR. GIGOT:  They had answers, but they failed."
232,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  Those, yeah.  It's really, do we have a long-term solution? Right now, you mentioned Steve Chu.  Obama's got an amazing all-star energy team..."
233,MS. MITCHELL:  Exactly.
234,MR. FRIEDMAN:  ...that could sell--they're in a witness protection program. Have you seen any of these people?
235,"MS. MITCHELL:  Well, that's the point."
236,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  I haven't.  You know, you have a sense that Obama is approaching this problem like every day taking a poll hour by hour.  I did not support this guy to read polls.  I supported him to change polls. "
237,"MR. GIGOT:  Tom, if you want..."
238,MR. FRIEDMAN:  OK.  And that's not what he's doing.
239,MR. WOODWARD:  But there's...
240,"MR. GIGOT:  If you want to reduce oil, you can do it pretty--you can start to do it very quickly.  You can put a $3 or $4 tax on gasoline."
241,MR. FRIEDMAN:  Well...
242,MR. GIGOT:  I know you're for that.
243,MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yeah.
244,"MR. GIGOT:  I, I, the president is not."
245,MR. FRIEDMAN:  I know.
246,MR. GIGOT:  There's no politician I know who is.  But that's the answer.
247,"MR. GREGORY:  But can I ask a searching question, though?"
248,"MR. FRIEDMAN:  Well, it's..."
249,"MR. GREGORY:  Can I ask a searching question?  I mean, Tom, you laid out this criticism, but what, what would you have the administration do?  I'm not asking that rhetorically.  I mean, what..."
250,"MR. WOODWARD:  To think and engage because it is something that's got to be dealt with.  But I think the one thing we've learned about oil is it's kind of answered the question why the oil companies have been making so much money. You don't have to go down there and pump it.  It just comes to you once you pierce the shell of the, of, of the bottom.  And all of this is coming, you know, no pumps.  It's spewing out in a way..."
251,"MR. GIGOT:  But if we stop offshore drilling, we're not going to stop oil spills.  The Exxon Valdez was a tanker spill.  We'd still have to import the oil.  So, I mean..."
252,"MS. MITCHELL:  Yes, but this is not an inevitable accident.  This was an accident caused by systems that were not there, systems that they had promised would be there, valves, we are now reading today, that were, were disregarded. There are, there are real mistakes here that need to be fixed."
253,MR. WOODWARD:  Undoubtedly.
254,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
255,MR. WOODWARD:  But it is a for a commission to do.
256,MR. GREGORY:  It is...
257,"MR. WOODWARD:  The, the question is, what do you do now?  And I, I mean, look, this whole thing may be not just going around Florida..."
258,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
259,MR. WOODWARD:  ...but up the East Coast.
260,MR. GREGORY:  And you just...
261,"MR. WOODWARD:  My God, it's going to come right here and destroy your set before, before the year is up."
262,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Well, but just to button this up, you have an issue where you have an oil spill that continues, you have a debt that continues to go up.  You talk about problems that Washington has to deal with."
263,"Thank you, all.  We're going to leave it there.  Thanks all very much."
264,"And we'll be right back.  For our viewers in the Twin Cities of Minnesota, I should point out, we would love to see you on Thursday for a special MEET THE PRESS ACROSS AMERICA forum that we are doing at the University of Minnesota with Governor Tim Pawlenty.  Check out our Web

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, day 41 of the oil disaster in the gulf. When will the leak be plugged?  And after his visit to the Gulf Coast Friday, is the president now in control or simply playing catch-up? Joining us, White House energy and environment adviser, Carol Browner.
    "
1,"Then, a nation divided over immigration and securing America's border with Mexico.  This morning, a debate about the president's decision to send 1,200 additional troops to the border and Arizona's controversial get tough law. With us, Congressman Luis Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, vs.  former Republican congressman from Arizona and Senate candidate J.D. Hayworth."
2,"Finally, the president's tough political week--the oil spill, immigration and the revelation that former President Clinton was enlisted to offer Congressman Joe Sestak a government position to stay out of the Pennsylvania Senate race. Analysis this morning from David Brooks of The
New York Times and E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post."
3,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
4,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
5,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  The leak has not been plugged.  The latest effort to stop the flow of oil from that broken well in the gulf, called ""top kill,"" has now been declared a failure.  The move had been promising a few days ago, but now yet another procedure must be attempted.  The
president issued a statement last night saying this news is as ""enraging as it is heartbreaking."" Here with us now live this morning is BP's managing director Robert Dudley."
6,Transcript & resource archive
7,"Mr. Dudley, welcome to MEET THE PRESS."
8,"MR. ROBERT DUDLEY:  Good morning, David."
9,MR. GREGORY:  What went wrong?
10,"MR. DUDLEY:  David, we made three attempts to wrestle this beast to the ground by pumping heavy fluids into it.  We were unable to overcome the flow. The scientists and the engineers from BP and the government reviewed all the data and determined that the next best option was that we needed to move as fast as possible to a containment operation, which we were beginning already, which will contain the flow and produce it to the surface."
11,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to put up that live picture of the flow that we're talking about and ask you a couple of questions about it.  I mean, this is just an amazing picture.  First of all, you know, you look at this thing and you think, ""Can't you just go in there and shove something on
top of it and stop it?"" Would you explain how difficult it is in 5,000 feet below the level--the sea level, with that kind of pressure, to do that?"
12,"MR. DUDLEY:  We have to do everything by robots, remote-operated vehicles. They virtually had to go down and construct a small city of architecture, of pipes, of manifolds and pumpings, and then connect them with these robots.  We had the problem of a well flow coming up through a top, through a blowout preventer, that we had to inject fluids into a blowout preventer.  Some of them went down, some of them went up.  But in the end, too much of the drilling mud that we were injecting came back up out of the well.  We were not able to overcome it, and so now we want to capture and contain and limit the oil on the, on the surface and in the water."
13,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, you've tried containment before unsuccessfully.  What makes you think this new attempt will work? "
14,"MR. DUDLEY:  Good question.  Very, very early days we went down with a dome to contain it.  What we found is that there's so much natural gas in the--what comes out of this well, it immediately forms an unusual thing called hydrates, which are ice crystals, which created the dome to float. This one we will have concentric pipes down it, we will pump warmer seawater down around it to keep the temperature within the right range, a little bit of methanol, and that's the way we want to prevent the problem that we had before."
15,MR. GREGORY:  What are the...
16,"MR. DUDLEY:  The objective is to, to contain the majority of the flow this way."
17,MR. GREGORY:  What are the chances this works?
18,"MR. DUDLEY:  I think the engineering on this is more simple than the, than the top kill.  What we need to do is go down with the robots, diamond cut saws, slice off the top of that riser with a clean surface--the flow rate shouldn't be that much higher--and then drop over it this containment.  It'll be a four to seven-day operation.  I think the probability of it working is much different than the, the top kill, which is luck."
19,"MR. GREGORY:  What--different, does that mean better?"
20,"MR. DUDLEY:  Better, absolutely better."
21,MR. GREGORY:  And you think we'll know by about four days?
22,"MR. DUDLEY:  I think by the end of the week, as we--as you know, the 5,000 feet of water, no humans could go down there.  We're reliant on the robots. These guys that are working offshore are incredibly skilled at this.  We've been asking them to do the equivalent of open heart surgery on television for everyone.  They, they are very, very careful people that check pressures and temperatures and connections."
23,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
24,MR. DUDLEY:  But I would say by the end of the week.
25,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to put up that live picture of the oil flow again, and I, I'd like you to just kind of level with the American people, how much oil is spilling into the gulf on a daily basis?"
26,"MR. DUDLEY:  We honestly do not know.  The original estimates, which were government and BP estimates together, primarily unified estimates of 5,000 barrels a day, were based on satellite pictures.  We've always found this a difficult oil to measure because of the, the huge amounts of gas in the oil. The, the new estimate range of I think it's 12,000 to 19,000 barrels has been issued without an actual flow measurement.  The one thing about this method that we're about to go into, it will and should measure the majority of the flow."
27,"MR. GREGORY:  If this doesn't work, do you have additional things you can try, or do you effectively have to stall and do what you can until a relief well is in place in August?"
28,"MR. DUDLEY:  Well, the backstop, and always the backstop, will be the relief well in August.  We--the engineers are going to take the data, the science, they may go back in and try to kill the well.  If the containment is successful and we can put in place a longer term containment program which is effectively producing the well, then that will minimize the amount of oil on the ocean.  So that's the trade-offs we want to make.  We don't want to do anything that creates a bigger problem than we have now.  We've been very careful not to do that before. So we'll see."
29,"MR. GREGORY:  It's stunning, the fact that BP, with all your expertise, did not have a better contingency plan than you appear to have.  I mean, it's been noted, the ad hoc nature of what you're doing, trying one thing, then another, and unsuccessfully so.  The president is reportedly incredibly angry about that and feels, frankly, misled by the industry. Did the industry mislead government about the danger of what it was doing and what would happen if something went terribly wrong at this level?"
30,"MR. DUDLEY:  Well, we're, we're angry too, and we understand the anger of the people, particularly those whose livelihoods have been affected on the Gulf Coast.  This is an unprecedented accident.  These, these blowout preventers which are used on oil and gas wells all around the world and have been used on more than 5,000 deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico have not failed before. There are multiple levels of failure redundancies in those blowout preventers, and we want to find out why this has happened.  The whole world will change as a result of this, and the industry, so that it never happens anywhere again."
31,"MR. GREGORY:  Sir, my question is whether the industry misled government."
32,MR. DUDLEY:  We did have a spill response.
33,MR. GREGORY:  Straightforward question:  Did the industry mislead government?
34,"MR. DUDLEY:  I don't think so.  The industry has--all around the world these pieces of equipment are inspected regularly, and in the U.S. they're inspected every 14 days.  This is a very unusual failure.  We need to find out why.  We need to learn from it and, and change the
industry for good. "
35,"MR. GREGORY:  Final question, sir.  We, we were told by the company last light--last night we'd be speaking to, to CEO Tony Hayward.  Apparently that changed or, or was--somebody was wrongly informed.  My question is, when this immediate crisis is over, Mr. Hayward is, metaphorically speaking, the captain of this ship.  Should he resign?"
36,"MR. DUDLEY:  Well, Tony Hayward has been here since the very beginning. He's been spending time in the engineer and control centers, he's been out on the rigs, he's been visiting with the governors and meeting in the, in the communities that have been affected.  Very early days he
said, ""We're not going to stand behind statutory limits of liability, we're going to take full responsibility for it, we're going to make good for it."" We've spent nearly a billion dollars on this cleanup effort.  I think he's done a, a great job of leading a company to stand up and do
the right thing.  We realize that there're frustrations that's out there. We're trying to make good so that people don't miss boat payments and house payments.  We've set these claims up at offices up all across the country, and we've been able to bring in four rigs and teams from around the world to respond to it."
37,MR. GREGORY:  So Tony Hayward should keep his job?
38,MR. DUDLEY:  This is not ideal circumstance--I think Tony's doing a fantastic job.
39,MR. GREGORY:  And he should stay in that job?
40,MR. DUDLEY:  I think so.
41,"MR. GREGORY:  OK, Mr. Dudley, we're going to leave it there.  Thank you very much."
42,MR. DUDLEY:  Thank you.
43,MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We now turn to White House energy and climate change adviser Carol Browner.
44,Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
45,MS. CAROL BROWNER:  Thank you.
46,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, accountability aside, I mean, it is just sort of shocking that we're in this position where something else hasn't worked. What's the president think about all of this?"
47,"MS. BROWNER:  Well, as the, as the president said, it's, it's both enraging and heartbreaking.  Obviously, getting this well under control, getting it closed is the highest priority, but also being responsive to the people of these gulf communities.  You know, the president was down
there on, on Friday. We had a very long, a very good conversation with the governors, with the parish presidents.  They noted some more things that they wanted done.  We've taken that seriously; we will be responding to that in the next couple of days.  You know, we want to continue to work with these governors and these parish presidents to deal with what
now is going to be a much different situation.  There could be oil coming up till August when the relief wells are dug.  I think, David, it's important to know that there's not just one being dug, there are two, because we insisted--the government insisted that there be a second in
case something went wrong with the first one.  In the meantime, our scientists have been down there, Dr. Chu has been leading a team of 150 scientists.  In fact, it was Dr. Chu's team that said to BP yesterday, ""We are very, very concerned if you continue to put pressure into that well that something even worse could happen."" That's when we turned to this containment exercise, which, you know, everyone's going to do everything they can to insure that it works."
48,MR. GREGORY:  But let me just break one thing down.  You just heard from Mr. Dudley from BP.  He thinks there's actually a better shot at containment now than even perhaps what they had with--what they were doing with the top kill. Is that the government's view as well?
49,"MS. BROWNER:  Well, the top kill would have shut it down.  There wouldn't have been any oil coming up.  We're now going to move into a situation where they're going to attempt to control the oil that's coming out, move it to a vessel, take it onshore.  Obviously that's not the preferred scenario.  We always knew that the relief well was the permanent way to close this, to get it killed so there wasn't oil coming up while the relief well was being drilled was the second option.  Now we move to the third option, which is to contain it.  And what our scientists are saying--I think you asked him some very good questions, which is why would this containment work vs.  the other containment?  It's going to be a cap, there'll be a snugger fit.  They've learned a lot from the first big cofferdam effort, but we're going to remain vigilant.  Our scientists are going to be on the scene asking probing questions, giving strong advice if we think something isn't going right."
50,"MR. GREGORY:  But the bottom line is, you're not--I should say, the bottom line is, the chances are very high that nothing is going to work until a relief well is in place.  All these attempts are still basically low-percentage plays.  We're looking at an oil flow that goes
on until August."
51,"MS. BROWNER:  We are prepared for the worst.  We have been prepared from the beginning.  We will continue to assume that we move into the worst case scenario, which is, as you point out, is there is some oil leaking onto--up to the surface and then onto the beaches and shorelines.  We will continue to prepare for that."
52,MR. GREGORY:  How much oil is coming out every day?
53,"MS. BROWNER:  It's important, I think, for people to understand that that is a hard question to answer.  So what we did is we put together an independent government review panel to look at this.  And here's why it's important to know that it's independent.  BP has a financial interest in these numbers. They will pay penalties at the end of the day, a per barrel, per day penalty. So what we wanted was a group that didn't include BP.  They looked at three issues to determine the flow rate. They looked at what was happening on the surface using satellite imagery. They looked at what had come up through the riser insertion, which has now been removed; and they also looked at the burn rate, and they looked at the plume.  And so based on those three groups--there were differences among the groups.  That's how scientists are, they have differences. When they came back together, they put forth the number of between  12,000 and 19,000 barrels.  They're going to continue to look at this. But if we are able to start capturing all of the oil, we will then have a better tool to determine precisely how much."
54,"MR. GREGORY:  I, I want to talk a little bit about accountability.  But before I do that, you're the president's top environmental adviser, what is the scale of this environmental disaster?"
55,"MS. BROWNER:  This is probably the biggest environmental disaster we've ever faced in this country.  It's certainly the biggest oil spill, and we're responding with the biggest environmental response. "
56,"MR. GREGORY:  And what does that mean?  Because that's--I mean, that's tough to hear, ""the biggest environmental disaster"" the country's ever faced."
57,"MS. BROWNER:  Well, it's very tough to hear.  I'm a lifelong environmentalist, I'm from Florida.  It's a very, very tough thing to hear."
58,MR. GREGORY:  But break that down.  What does that mean?
59,"MS. BROWNER:  It means more oil is leaking into the Gulf of Mexico than at any other time in our history.  It means there is more, more, more oil than the Exxon Valdez."
60,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.  And the ecological impact?
61,"MS. BROWNER:  Well, the good news is, if there's any good news here, is that we have a lot of systems in place to manage and decrease the amount of oil that comes onshore.  So, for example, more than 80 burns have been conducted. These burns are highly successful, they corral the oil, they burn it.  Now, we can't do it all the time; weather conditions don't
always allow for it. Secondly, there is booming that is in place. You--the president visited some of that booming.  They're able to capture the, the little pellets, the, the little slicks of oil that come onshore. And then finally there is the skimming.  There are over 1,400 vessels in this part of the Gulf of Mexico. We are using skimmers that skim up the oil sheen.  They bring up water, too. I think it's over 11 billion barrels of oil and water that have now been skimmed up.  All of that is going to continue."
62,"MR. GREGORY:  The president says the buck stops with him.  He was down in the Gulf Coast on Friday saying that.  What specifically, though--I mean, the government is now trying to make a big show, frankly, of the fact that it's in control and it's ordering BP to do things.  Give me an
example of something that it ordered BP to do that it didn't want to do. "
63,"MS. BROWNER:  Well, the government's been in control from the beginning. The example--one example would be they said--BP said, ""We're going to drill one relief well."" These are expensive wells for them to drill.  We said, ""That's not good enough.  You're going to drill a second one.""
Yesterday, Steven Chu and his team said, ""You cannot continue to put downward pressure on that well. It will not work."" You know, BP has technology, the industry has technology, they know how to work the robots.  We need them for that.  But don't make any mistake here, the
government is in charge."
64,MR. GREGORY:  Did the government order BP to stop the top kill?
65,"MS. BROWNER:  The scientists met yesterday, and our concerns were shared, and at that point it was stopped."
66,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, what does that mean?  BP is still the one who is the, is the first line who knows what to do to stop this, even more--Steven Chu won the Nobel Prize and he's obviously involved.  But isn't BP still running the operation?  They're the ones who have the best technology and the best know-how to stop this."
67,"MS. BROWNER:  They--you're right.  They manage the robots, they put in place all of the equipment that has to be staged on the ocean floor.  But at the end of the day, the government tells BP what to do.  And at the end of the day, we will hold BP accountable for all of the costs associated with this."
68,"MR. GREGORY:  Will you get that cap lifted, that $75 million cap, for damages?"
69,"MS. BROWNER:  We certainly hope so.  We've asked Congress to lift it. But that, that, that, that's changing a law.  Let's focus on, I think, what's happening here and now.  BP has said repeatedly they mean to pay for all of the costs.  We take all as all, and we will make sure that
they pay for all of the costs."
70,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk about government's role here.  This week, part of our MEET THE PRESS ACROSS AMERICA forum we went to Minnesota and interviews Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, a likely presidential candidate in 2012, and he laid out some of the criticism that you've heard against the administration.  Let's play that."
71,"(Videotape, Thursday)"
72,"Governor TIM PAWLENTY (R-MN):  What we do know is this:  This crisis was the result of negligence or a malfunction.  This rig was approved on this administration's watch.  There's going to have to be a review of what was reviewed, why it was reviewed.  There was decision-making on the ground on the platform on the day of the crisis that may have contributed to the, to the problem.  And as to the cleanup operations, there's lots of concern.  You know, why aren't more skimmers out there?  Why aren't they working longer hours?  Why did they rely just on BP early on to tell us what the volume of the, of the leak was?  Why didn't we independently verify that using government sources?  Why weren't booms replaced more
frequently once they became saturated and releaked oil?  So there's going to be a lot of those questions that may very well point back to this administration or the president.  He wants to say he's in charge.  That's great.  I'm glad he's assuming responsibility and accountability.  I wish he would have done it probably earlier."
73,(End videotape)
74,"MR. GREGORY:  The real question is, is the president now in control or is he playing catch-up?"
75,"MS. BROWNER:  The president's been in control from the beginning.  The rig fell on April 22nd.  A number of us joined the president in the Oval Office that evening to fully brief him.  And since that time, he has been up to date, current.  He knows what's going on, he's in charge.  We obviously have Admiral Allen, the incident commander, the National Incident Commander, who is watching this on an hour-by-hour basis.  I'm the point person in the White House.  But we also have our Cabinet fully deployed.  Everybody from Homeland Security to DOD, to the EPA, to Interior, to NOAA.  This is a--as I said, this is a very, very large disaster, and we are deploying all of our resources."
76,"MR. GREGORY:  But let, let me ask you, you know, one of the things the president said is, look, problem with regulation, you know, government was too cozy with the industry in terms of government regulators.  They had not contingency plan.  I mean, you heard me ask Mr. Dudley, ""How, how could you be drilling in 5,000 feet and not have a real contingency plan
if something goes wrong?"" Now the government regulators, MMS, they were apparently working on this for 15 months.  And my question is, why wasn't the administration's priority working on the lack of regulatory control, working on this lack of a contingency plan instead of focusing on upping domestic production and doing more drilling, which is what the president, with, with your advice, has suggested be done? "
77,"MS. BROWNER:  Well, first of all, let's take MMS. From the beginning Ken Salazar was focused on the ethics issues.  You're right, it was way too cozy a relationship.  There was a legacy of serious, serious problems. He came in, they put in place brand new ethics requirements.  It's also important to know MMS doesn't exist anymore, and the reason it doesn't exist anymore is because there were inherent conflicts.  You had one entity issuing permits, collecting the royalties, collecting the revenues, and enforcing the law.  That has now been broken into three
component parts, a very significant change.  You know, I, I, I found the governor's comments interesting about what went wrong and how did it go wrong.  There will be a full investigation.  We will all understand, the American people will understand exactly what happened here. We've also appointed a commission so that we can make decisions about..."
78,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Ms. Browner, you're looking forward.  I'm asking you a simple question of not just the cozy relationship.  The president again and again has cited a lack of contingency planning.  What if something went terribly wrong?  It was reported this week in The Washington Post that he's been telling aides privately, ""I guess we were misled by the
industry."" You heard me ask Mr. Dudley that.  But MMS, this administration did not sufficiently work on the lack of contingency planning before moving ahead with more drilling.  Wasn't that a mistake that can be understood now, not down the road?"
79,"MS. BROWNER:  David, I, I, I think that we have to understand all of these things going forward.  But I do think it's important to understand that these wells have been drilled for several decades now.  There have not been these kinds of accidents.  But going forward, we have to change what we're doing because it was an accident, and we have to learn from
this accident.  And, you know, in the interim, we have shut down all deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico until we have an answer to, one, how can you make sure that these operations are safe, that there are redundancies in place?  And, to your point, secondly, what happens when those redundancies don't work?  We have to understand both of those before we go forward, and we will understand both of those before we go forward."
80,"MR. GREGORY:  Is part of the problem here--you go back to the Clinton administration where there was thought to be more emphasis on environmental protection then there was on exploration of sources of energy.  In the Bush administration, the criticism was far too much 
concentration on energy production, not enough on the environment.  And here you are now working for President Obama, saying, ""Yes, we ought to do additional drilling."" Is the problem that we're drilling in water that's just too deep?  Should you even rethink your own approach to the environment to say, ""Maybe in the Arctic Wildlife Reserve, we ought to be drilling there.  We ought to be going into shallower waters so that this can be done more safely""?"
81,"MS. BROWNER:  There's a lot of--I think on the shallow waters, the distinction is you can get to the wellhead if something goes wrong in shallow water, and you can--there's mechanisms to shut that down.  You are asking all the right questions on deep water.  We have to answer
those questions before we proceed.  That is why all of those operations have been shut down.  In the Arctic, they've been shut down; in the Gulf of Mexico, they've been shut down, including 33 rigs that were out there drilling right now, which, you know, we understand it's going to be hard on those people."
82,"MR. GREGORY:  But as an environmentalist, I'm asking you, have you rethought your position on this? "
83,"MS. BROWNER:  I want to see what the investigations tell us, I want to see what our commission has to say.  You know, at the end of the day, we will make the right decision in terms of insuring that our environment is protected, insuring that we have all of the information to make those decisions."
84,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, Ms. Browner, we will leave it there.  Thank you very much."
85,"Coming up next, a nation divided, the debate over immigration reform and the president's decision to send more troops to the border.  Congressman Luis Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois, and former Republican congressman from Arizona, J.D. Hayworth, square off.  Plus, political analysis from David Brooks and E.J. Dionne, only on MEET THE PRESS."
86,(Announcements)
87,"MR. GREGORY:  Up next, the controversial fight over immigration reform and the president's decision to send more troops to the border, after this brief commercial break."
88,(Announcements) 
89,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  And we are back, talking about a nation divided over immigration, joined now by the chair of the immigration task force for the Democratic Caucus, Illinois Congressman Luis Gutierrez, and Republican senatorial candidate for the state of Arizona, former congressman from Arizona, J.D. Hayworth."
90,"Welcome, both of you."
91,"You've been debating this for years, even on this program, and yet we still don't have comprehensive reform.  We do this week, however, Congressman, have news from the administration.  They are going to send down 1,200 additional National Guard troops to the Southwest border.  You have called this sound bite-driven politics.  Does it make any difference to send all those troops down there?"
92,"REP. LUIS GUTIERREZ (D-IL):  I think, in the absence of a holistic approach to comprehensive immigration reform, it really isn't going to solve the problem.  I think you've probably been to a graduation or two. So have I.  We know that thousands of those students that come here on
student visas aren't going home.  It's summer.  We see all the tourists here in Washington, D.C. We know that thousands of those tourists aren't going home.  We know that there are workers that come here on temporary work permits; we know they're not all going home.  Forty percent of all the undocumented workers, our undocumented population, came here legally
to this country and have overstayed their visas.  So even if you shut down the border, it isn't going to answer the total question.  So what I'm proposing is that we look at it from a holistic perspective."
93,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Well...
94,"REP. GUTIERREZ:  I understand the frustration at the border, I understand that the border is a necessary component; but in and of itself, doesn't solve the problem."
95,"MR. GREGORY:  You're in a tough primary fight with John McCain, Senator McCain, who wants 6,000 additional troops down at the border.  I mean, if you look at this dispatch from The Washington Post today, the first paragraph talks about 687 illegal immigrants in a 24-hour period last week.  Is 1,200 enough?  Is it neither now there in terms of a response?"
96,"FMR. REP. J.D. HAYWORTH (R-AZ):  David, let me begin on the point of unanimity..."
97,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
98,"REP. HAYWORTH:  ...because this is a contentious question.  I know we all want to pause and give thanks for those who gave the last full measure of devotion this Memorial Day weekend.  And because this is a question of national security, I think this notion of 1,200 Guardsmen is woefully inadequate.  When you go back and check the press accounts, we hear that actually the president of Mexico and the government of Mexico, not content on lecturing the state of Arizona and the majority of American citizens from a joint session of Congress, now instructed the State Department, ""Hey, if you're sending people there, don't have them enforce immigration laws."" So what we are seeing right now is a situation where you will have troops essentially working to maintain border patrol vehicles, change oil, change tires, or work in the office dealing with computers.  This is cosmetic.  It is ineffective because 1,200 Guardsmen
across four states, do the math."
99,REP. HAYWORTH:  That's 300 Guardsmen per state.
100,"MR. GREGORY:  But from your point of view, then, is it simply a question of how many troops?  Would more be better?"
101,"REP. HAYWORTH:  Well, it--absolutely."
102,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
103,"REP. HAYWORTH:  And like the book I wrote years ago, ""Whatever It Takes,"" the numbers necessary.  Look, we are dealing with a national security crisis here, not just Mexicans coming across the border..."
104,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
105,REP. HAYWORTH:  ...but we're dealing with others.
106,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but let's look at it in a bigger context."
107,REP. HAYWORTH:  Yeah.
108,"MR. GREGORY:  This was the scene in Phoenix, where you live, a massive protest.  They were expecting on order of 20,000 protesters yesterday protesting the Arizona law, protesting in favor of a more comprehensive approach.  And that's my question for both of you."
109,"And Congressman Hayworth, I'll start with you.  How do you talk about securing the border only and not deal with this in a comprehensive way, dealing with the fact that you've got two things:  some 12 million illegal immigrants in the country; and a culture in America where we're
at once saying, ""Stop at the border, but please keep coming because we need the labor."""
110,"REP. HAYWORTH:  No, I, I would challenge a couple of points of the premise of your question.  But first of all, Americans understand that comprehensive immigration reform is a poll-tested phrase that essentially means amnesty. People want to see the laws enforced.  To paraphrase Mr. Justice Brandeis, when the government itself supports lawlessness, you end up with anarchy.  And the fact is, we need not only to enforce the border, we need interior enforcement.  And let's take it away from the border for a second, David, to, to the major cities in the Northeast. For example, in New York City, a policy was adopted called the ""broken
windows"" theory of policing, where you enforce the law for infractions no matter how seemingly minor and, as a result, overall crime drops.  Now, the sad fact is Luis--and I've got it documented in the book--said he didn't like the term ""amnesty"" because it applied forgiveness.  We've appeared in different forums, and to this day, Luis has never answered the question, do you believe crossing the border, Luis, is not an illegal act when it's on the books that, in fact, it is illegal?"
111,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, the, the, the--but the question--I don't think there's a question that it's illegal.  It's, it's also a matter of practicality and political will.  Are you going to start deporting 12 million people back? There's never been the political will to do that."
112,"But answer the question, Congressman.  Whatever this congressman says about whether that's just a poll-tested phrase, there is such a thing as comprehensive immigration reform that deals with a legal path to citizenship for those who are already here..."
113,REP. GUTIERREZ:  Sure.
114,MR. GREGORY:  ...reflecting the fact that you can't just deport 12 million people back to Mexico.
115,REP. GUTIERREZ:  Sure.
116,MR. GREGORY:  How do you secure one without pursuing the other?
117,"REP. GUTIERREZ:  First of all, what you need is a comprehensive approach to it.  Because here's what I say, we have a magnet, their jobs.  So, listen, I got a driver's license, it has my photo on it.  I have a passport, and when I go in and out of the country, the government swipes that passport and it says, ""OK, Luis, you're ready to come in.  You're authorized."" Why can't we have a Social Security card with a picture on it, so when you go get a job you swipe it?  And if employers don't use that card issued by the government to authorize you before you go to work, we send those employers to jail.  So we can be tough and stop the magnet of the jobs.  But at the same time, let's be realistic.  My friend J.D. simply wants them to disappear, as though this is the latest installment of a ""Harry Potter"" series.  They're not going to disappear. They have deep roots in their communities, they're here.  So what I want to do is be fair and practical at the same time and resolve the issue of the undocumented status of workers here in this country."
118,"MR. GREGORY:  Let, let's show--yeah."
119,REP. GUTIERREZ:  So what--if I could...
120,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
121,"REP. GUTIERREZ:  What I'd like to do, because--is, is simply do this. That little girl, that little second grade girl who asked the first lady, ""What about my mommy and her papers?"" I want to say to that mother, ""Come and register with the government.  Give us--go through a background check.  Pay a fine.  Go to the back of the line.  Learn English.  Make sure you learn all about our country.  Be the best American worker you can be so that you can raise the best American citizen child."" And when that young little second grader is an adult, she can say, ""My country stood by my mother, by me, and cherished our family and our family values."""
122,"MR. GREGORY:  And here's--the Arizona law reflected a lot of frustration in Arizona, in the government, that federal laws were not being enforced to stop the flow across the border, which I alluded to just a moment ago. And here's a political reality.  We put our recent poll up on the screen.  Sixty-one percent of those polled support that law.  Do you understand the frustration in Arizona?"
123,"REP. GUTIERREZ:  Absolutely.  And their frustration is that the federal government has not assumed its rightful and obligatory responsibility to have our immigration laws enforced in this country.  But if you ask those same people, ""Well, do you agree with Luis that we should go after employers and make sure that they go to jail if they hire undocumented workers?"" they say yes.  ""Do you agree with Luis that we should charge those people a fine and make them right with the law and make sure that they learn English and that we bring them""--if you ask those same people, ""Are you frustrated with the immigration laws?  Do you really think this
is going to reduce crime?"" They tell you, ""No, we really don't think it's going to reduce crime."""
124,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
125,"REP. GUTIERREZ:  What we really do--what we really want to do is send the message to the federal government.  They've sent the message.  I understand their frustration.  Their frustration is real.  But what I don't want to allow is to continue to exploit that frustration, right, with simple sound bites and not give a solution.  I have a solution that
will solve..."
126,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
127,"REP. GUTIERREZ:  ...the undocumented status of people here in this
country..."
128,"MR. GREGORY:  Let, let me--Congressman..."
129,REP. GUTIERREZ:  ...and illegal immigration.
130,"MR. GREGORY:  And the big issue--we both got our copy of the bill, and make no mistake, I have read it, OK?  And we can go through that."
131,REP. GUTIERREZ:  Yes.
132,"REP. HAYWORTH:  You've got the House version, I've got the Senate version
here."
133,"MR. GREGORY:  And we can go through that.  OK.  Well, I've got both, actually, right in front of me."
134,REP. HAYWORTH:  Good.  OK.
135,"MR. GREGORY:  And I know about the amendments from one to the other.  The big issue here, let's get right into the center of it, is this an invitation for racial profiling?  And we can both turn, because I'm sure you'll quote it if I don't, to the relevant section which is that basically, I'm paraphrasing here, a police officer may not consider race, color, or national origin in the enforcement of this section except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution.  It's right there in the law.  It says no profiling.  But let me ask you a practical question, if you're driving down the street in Phoenix and you're going too fast and a cop pulls you over, and if you're doing the same and a cop pulls you over, what else are they going to look at besides the fact that he's Hispanic to ask him whether he has his papers and he's here legally?"
136,"REP. HAYWORTH:  Now, David, you set up a situation.  Let's talk about the commonality of the experience.  First of all, Luis and I are remarkably safe drivers.  But we're dealing with a hypothetical here.  If we were pulled over for speeding, the first request from a law enforcement professional would be to see our license, registration, and proof of insurance.  Now, in some overheated political rhetoric, some people are saying, ""Oh, they're asking for your papers."" The fact is, and I'll quote right back to you, what it says at the conclusion of the Senate bill: ""This act shall be implemented in a manner consistent with federal laws regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all persons, and respecting the privileges and immunities of United States citizens."" What has happened here is there's been a concerted effort to shift this from a question of enforcement, which is a sound public policy priority we
should have.  It has now been changed, they're trying to shift this to a question of ethnicity and ethnic profiling, thinking there is some political benefit to be gained.  That is not the case, and I believe law enforcement professionals will do well."
137,"MR. GREGORY:  So no, no, Congressman, no risk of profiling, as you heard the congressman talk about?"
138,"REP. GUTIERREZ:  Well, here's what's going to happen.  The fact is that Latinos have lived in the state of Arizona before it was the state of Arizona. There are families that go back generation after generation. And yes, it is Memorial Day tomorrow, and here's what's going to happen. There's going to be a group of guys that are going to play the soccer game.  They're going to be coming home.  Someone calls on the phone and says, ""There's a disturbance,"" and they're going to ask somebody, ""Do you have your documents?"" "
139,"""Well, hey, I was out playing soccer, so I didn't bring my papers with me.  But by the way, I served in Afghanistan, I served in Iraq, and because of that they expedited my citizenship papers. Can you come by my house so I can show?  Will that do?"" That's what's going to happen.  You're going to ask men and women who have served this nation for their papers merely because of the color of their skin. They've paid the highest price, they've paid the highest tax, they've shown their devotion, their love for this country, and this country should do nothing to set them apart and to distinguish them as a criminal element.  And that's the practicality of what's going to happen."
140,"Look, the fact is that the Latino community feels besieged upon.  It feels as though the finger-pointing is against them, that somehow they're a criminal element.  But that's not new.  Look, there have been distinctions--the Germans in Pennsylvania, the Irish in Massachusetts,
the Italians in New York. There's always been.  Let's stop that finger-pointing.  Let's get real solutions to our, to, to our immigration problem, to our immigration crisis that we have in this country.  So what I want to say is, look, we've all walked into the store.  You want to
talk about racial--OK, we've all walked in, we've seen the person washing dishes.  We've seen the person in the stroller, strolling the kids as we go off to work.  We've seen who picks our, our fruit and who does our agricultural work.  Instead of simply looking at them, why don't we say, ""I'm not going to look at you.  I want to make you a taxpayer.  I want to make you right with the law.  I want to teach you English."""
141,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  But...
142,"REP. GUTIERREZ:  ""I want to make you the best American I can."""
143,"MR. GREGORY:  ...let's stay on this.  So, Congressman Hayworth, are you not concerned that just as this country has done, unfortunately, in the name of a national crisis in the past, during World War II, that there will not be excesses?  That there will not be a denial of simple civil rights?  The law can say everything it wants.  You know that what happens in practice is what actually matters here, and this is a pretty hotly contested issue.  And, and people are getting hot under the collar all over the state of Arizona and the country."
144,"REP. HAYWORTH:  I think it's important to deal with reality rather than fancy--fanciful tales of what if.  I respect the notion that freedom isn't free.  Luis and I understand this Memorial Day weekend, so many fought and died for that.  But, also, we don't breed a culture of convenience.  We breed a culture of law and order.  And I dare say that people are pleased to show, when, when called upon as, as law-abiding American citizens, that they're here legally.  But understand, law enforcement professionals are undergoing training to make sure the law is 
applied in a just manner.  The fact is where we've gotten into trouble, David, is a failure of our government to enforce existing law."
145,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
146,"REP. HAYWORTH:  All Arizona is saying is let's enforce the laws on the books, and that's what we're working to do."
147,MR. GREGORY:  A final question to each of you on the politics of this. 
148,"Congressman, you're in a, as I mentioned, in a primary battle with Senator McCain.  You have acknowledged in that book that you've held up a couple of times that going back to 2001 you actually believed in a guest worker program. You believed in a path towards citizenship, which you now call amnesty. Senator McCain was a champion of comprehensive reform with Senator Kennedy back during the Bush administration.  But he's also been a pretty consistent supporter of additional resources on the border.  How does your position really differ from his?"
149,"REP. HAYWORTH:  Well, it differs profoundly, because what happened 9/11 helped the scales fall from my eyes.  I understand that national security is border security, and I understand that we must enforce the laws. You're right, what Mr. McCain offers is first, for political consumption, a get tough policy on the border, but then, again, he wants to bring back amnesty. And I would remind the viewers that in the 2007 bill with the late Senator Kennedy, the Heritage Foundation estimated that long-term retirement benefits alone for illegals granted citizenship would be $2.6 trillion.  So much for fiscal responsibility from my opponent."
150,"MR. GREGORY:  But just, just to be fair, you are on--at odds with Senator McCain on this, with former President Bush..."
151,"REP. HAYWORTH:  Oh, yes."
152,MR. GREGORY:  ...and a lot of other Republicans who don't agree with your characterization that it's amnesty.  Just to be clear.
153,"REP. HAYWORTH:  No.  But the bottom line is this, this is not a partisan question, this is not a question of right vs.  left, it's right vs. wrong. And apart from party distinction, Americans want to see laws enforced, and they don't want to see amnesty."
154,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Final point for you, Congressman Gutierrez. You were arrested in front of the White House recently, you've been critical of the White House in their handling of this.  Does President Obama--this is the picture on May 1st of you being arrested in front of
the White House--do you believe President Obama has the political will to make immigration reform, in a comprehensive way, a priority?  I mean a real priority."
155,REP. GUTIERREZ:  I think he's going to need to do that.  And I think...
156,"MR. GREGORY:  And he's not there yet, in your mind?"
157,"REP. GUTIERREZ:  I, I don't think he's there yet.  And I think the president has to understand that simple political sound bites is not what the American people want.  They want practical solutions.  He knows what the solution is to this issue.  He has to demonstrate the political will
and the political courage to take it on.  Let me just suggest once again, look, it is a bipartisan issue.  I worked with Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy.  I introduced the bill in the House with Congressman Flake and Congressman Kolbe, a comprehensive bill.  So it does exist.  What doesn't exist is the political will to--and the American people, you know what they say to me?  They say, ""Put aside the exploitation of our anger and our frustration.  Give us sensible, practical solutions."" I have one. I'm going to send employers to jail.  I'm going to give everybody an ID so that they're right with the law. I'm going to make sure they pay taxes
and get right with the law.  Does the president have the will?  He hasn't demonstrated it this week because what he does is respond easily by sending 1,200 troops.  It's a good beginning but we see the rejection. Because there are those who only want to look at this from the state of Arizona's perspective.  It's a national problem."
158,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
159,REP. HAYWORTH:  That's it precisely.  That's precisely...
160,REP. GUTIERREZ:  And only the federal government can resolve it.
161,"MR. GREGORY:  OK.  I'm going, I'm going to make that the last word.  To
be continued."
162,REP. GUTIERREZ:  Thank you.
163,REP. HAYWORTH:  Oh...
164,"MR. GREGORY:  To be continued--I know.  Thank you both very much for
being here."
165,REP. GUTIERREZ:  Thank you.
166,"MR. GREGORY:  Up next, another tough political week for the president. That oil spill, immigration, and a controversial offer via a former president to Pennsylvania Senate candidate Joe Sestak.  Analysis ahead with David Brooks of The New York Times and E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post after this brief station break."
167,(Announcements)
168,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We're back, joined now by New York Times columnist David Brooks and columnist for The Washington Post, E.J. Dionne. "
169,"Welcome.  Brooks and Dionne, almost like the country music act, but not quite. Anyway, so much to get to here with this oil spill.  You know, the president, in his press conference, I thought, summed it up with one line about what it is he's facing, that this crisis and accountability reaches to the edge of his bathroom when he's shaving.  This is what he said."
170,"(Videotape, Thursday)"
171,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  ...when I woke up this morning, and I'm shaving, and Malia knocks on my bathroom door, and she peeks in her head and she says, ""Did you plug the hole yet, Daddy?"""
172,(End videotape)
173,"MR. GREGORY:  I mean, it really comes back to that, E.J.  I've been asked this week, ""Well, what does the president do to do a better job, you  know, connecting on all this?"" You, you plug the leak, is what you do. And we've heard this morning that it hasn't happened.  Carol Browner saying worst environmental disaster in the country's history."
174,"MR. E.J. DIONNE:  Well, you know, I think the frustrating thing is that we think government has all kinds of power, and then we discover that when something like happens, when even people who are anti-government want the government to have power to do something, turns out most of the capacity to stop this is in the hands of BP.  And I think the president had this ambiguity at that--this news conference where he kept saying, ""We're in charge,"" but we all know that the equipment and basically most of the judgments are being made by a private company.  So this puts him in a terrible position.  And I think a question you kept asking in the earlier part of the show is the one that haunts me, which is, why isn't it that we--meaning BP in this case--weren't prepared for the worst possible case.  And, you know, I think we're going to sort of look at our whole environmental argument a little differently. Environmentalists, people always say, ""Oh, those environmentalists.  They only look at the worst case scenario."" Well, suddenly, we are confronted with it, and I think we're going to have to rethink on some of these very complicated things we're doing--deepwater drilling being one of them.  Do we have to think a whole lot more about the worst case than we used to?"
175,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, look what we started doing in government post 9/11. The continuity of government planning that went on that only was the very worst possible scenario envisioned.  And that's why, you know, members of the administration go to secret locations to practice these."
176,"David Brooks, how is the administration doing?"
177,"MR. DAVID BROOKS:  Well, it depends what you expect.  You know, if you think government is the center of national life, government can do everything, then you're disappointed.  But for those of us who don't expect that of government, who know there are limits to government power, then we're--you know, we--people say, ""Oh, he should do something.  He should do something."" James Carville says that.  But what exactly should he do?  He doesn't have a degree in underwater engineering.  I don't expect government to do everything, and I don't expect they will be able to do everything.  And so we're going to have to live with this, live
with the awareness that there are limits to what government can do.  I do think this is a big moment, though, the failure of the top kill.  I do think it's a big moment because we could be facing really weeks or months of that image.  And that image of the oil spewing out will become the central image of the year.  And for President Obama, who's had a really heroic presidency for the first year, now he's entering a period of a limited presidency--limits to his power, limits to money.  It's a different type of presidency, and that image will be the core image of
the year."
178,"MR. GREGORY:  E.J., I mean, I think we might even be able to bring up that image, the notion that you can go to a live image of an oil leak that is out of control.  You talk about the split screen version of a presidency, you know, I mean, there it is now.  I mean, this question
that keeps coming up, is--the shorthand in Washington, is this Obama's Katrina?"
179,"MR. DIONNE:  Yeah, and I think the answer is it's not Obama's Katrina, but it's a huge problem for the president.  You know, David has said that the government can't do everything, and I think almost everybody agrees with that. I think socialists agree with that.  I think that's not the issue.  The issue is what could government have done earlier on.  We learn now from The New York Times this morning that BP, 11 months ago, had the sense they had a problem here.  What was done about it?  Was there a role for the regulator to look into this--to have a greater opportunity to look into this?  We learn that the Minerals Management Service, in some cases, the companies would fill out these forms in pencil and then, you know, it would be ratified.  So, yeah, we can't have government doing everything.  But we're looking for more competent government, which is what President Obama promised.  That's why this is such a big test for him.  And it's the worst test he could possibly face because government's capacity in this is limited."
180,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me, let me move on to another area of limitation for the administration, and that's politically.  Joe Sestak, who wants to be the senator from Pennsylvania, the Democrat, took on Arlen Specter, took on the White House, even, was where you are just last week, and I asked him about this notion that the administration offered him a job to get out of the way. This is how the exchange went."
181,"(Videotape, last Sunday)"
182,MR. GREGORY:  What job were you offered to stay out of a primary race by the administration?
183,"REP. JOE SESTAK (D-PA):  It's interesting.  I was asked a question about something that happened months earlier, and I felt I should answer it honestly.  And that's all I had to say about it."
184,"MR. GREGORY:  Yes or no, straightforward question, were you, were you offered a job, and, and what was the job?"
185,"REP. JOE SESTAK:  I was offered a job, and I answered that."
186,(End videotape)
187,"MR. GREGORY:  It turns out the White House Counsel's Office put out a report saying he was offered a spot, a government position on a presidential commission.  He, he could have kept his, his role as congressman.  And it was Bill Clinton, the former president, dispatched--president, dispatched by Rahm Emanuel to see whether he'd accept that and not run."
188,"David, what's the big issue here?"
189,"MR. BROOKS:  Well, the big issue is that the president has said, you  know, he's tired of the small-minded politics in Washington.  He's exasperated by all the pettiness.  But the fact is, if I once see them not take a chance to be petty and small-minded in politics as usual, I, I'd like to see that, because they practice the same rules that everybody else practices--to give people jobs, to push people out of the races. It's not illegal, it's not a big scandal, but it's politics as usual. And, and that's what they do, that's what most politicians do.  I just wish they wouldn't pretend so much they're not doing any of that stuff."
190,"MR. GREGORY:  E.J., is the bigger issue that they seemed rather ham-handed in their intervention, that if you're going to use Bill Clinton, you should be able to carry something like this off? "
191,"MR. DIONNE:  Well, you know, first of all the original sin here is bragging by Joe Sestak during the primaries..."
192,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
193,"MR. DIONNE:  ...where he was trying to make the point, ""I'm standing up to the Obama people running against Arlen Specter."" And he sort of put this on the table himself, and then suddenly there's a blowback afterward.  And I think David's right in the sense that every--the notion
that somehow offering somebody a job connected to politics, if that were uniformly enforced, God knows how many people would go to jail.  What they've done here is constructed a story, which we all hope is true, that seems to get around any legal restriction on offering the guy a job. It's just..."
194,"MR. BROOKS:  (Unintelligible)...""we're better than Washington, better than the lame brains of the press corps."" That's been an underlying theme  for the last couple of weeks from the administration.  And when you match it to the things they actually do, it just doesn't match."
195,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to end on a note about the economy.  We did this MEET THE PRESS ACROSS AMERICA forum this week in Minnesota with Governor Pawlenty. And I asked him a question about the economy, and I thought his response was interesting in terms of framing the Republican argument on the economy, which is still a big issue against the administration.
Let's watch."
196,"(Videotape, Thursday)"
197,"MR. GREGORY:  The, the economy now is growing.  It's on track to create on the order of 1.7 million jobs this year.  If that happens, does the Obama administration deserve credit for a turnaround?"
198,"GOV. TIM PAWLENTY (R-MN):  It over--you can't push this much money into the economy in the near term and not have it have some effect.  But what I would suggest to you is it's phony effect.  I think you're going to see in 2011, 2012, if you don't have the private economy pick up the slack of the phony inflation of the economy over the next couple of years, you're going to trigger a whole set of another adverse events, including potentially inflation. But President Obama, if this economy recovers and stays recovered, will get due credit.  But I would suggest to you, at least in the intermediate and long-term, that's not what's going to happen."
199,(End videotape)
200,MR. GREGORY:  E.J.?
201,MR. DIONNE:  The jobs created from the stimulus are largely in the private sector.  It's rule number one of the--of economics that when the government pushes out this money it has an effect across the economy. We'll see if Governor Pawlenty will indeed give them credit in two years if the economy is moving.  You should have him back on.
202,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah, I think well do that.  We're going to leave it there. Thank you both."
203,"A reminder, you can watch our entire MEET THE PRESS ACROSS AMERICA forum with Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty.  It's on our Web site, mtp.msnbc.com.  And our thanks to our Twin Cities affiliate, CARE-11, for partnering with us for that event."
204,(Announcements)
205,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  A quick programming note this morning.  Stay with NBC News for continuing coverage of the oil spill, including special editions of ""Nightly News"" with Brian Williams.  He'll be reporting from the Louisiana Gulf Coast Tuesday and Wednesday evening."
206,"That is all for today.  We'll be away next Sunday during NBC's Sports coverage of the French Open, but we will return the following week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."
207,"And as we leave you this Memorial Day weekend, we honor and remember all those men and women who have given their lives in service to this nation. "

MR. GREGORY:
Good morning. The president is on day two of his 10-
day trip
 to 
Asia
. But back at home, the fallout from Tuesday's big 
election
 continues. And the big question now, how will the 
Republicans
 use the new power they have? Joining me from his home 
state of South Carolina
 this morning, the 
Washington
leader
 of the 
tea party
, Republican Senator 
Jim DeMint
. Senator, welcome to 
MEET THE PRESS
.
"
15,"
SEN. JIM DeMINT (R-SC):
Thank you, 
David
. 
And I
 can't claim to be the 
leader
 of the 
tea party
, but I'm sure glad they raised the interest level of the American voter this year. It made a real difference in the 
election
.
"
16,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, well, let me ask you that, plain and simple. Is the 
tea party
 now running the 
Republican Party
?
"
17,"
SEN. DeMINT:
Hardly. I'm hoping the 
Republican Party
 will embrace a lot of the ideas of the 
tea party
, but it's a mistake to think that the 
tea party
 is one big organization. It's made of up thousands of leaders all across the 
country
 of, of citizens who are just tired of out-of-
control
 spending. They want to take back the power from the 
Washington
 politicians. 
And I
 think they made a huge difference in the 
election
. But they're just a part of this awakening of the 
American people
, this 
citizen
 activism, I think, that's realigning politics in 
America
 today.
"
18,"
MR. GREGORY:
What about the 
election
 results on Tuesday? In your judgment, was that step one in making 
President Obama
 a one-term president?
"
19,"
SEN. DeMINT:
Well, I don't know that that's the issue. I think people are rejecting in large numbers this rampage of 
government spending
 and takeover that the, the president has been leading, but also even before 
Obama
 was president, 
Pelosi
 and 
Reid
 have been in charge of the 
Congress
 now for four years. They've had plenty of time to show what they're going to do. 
Pelosi
 said there would not be anymore 
deficit spending
; we've had $5 
trillion
 in deficit since then. So I think this is a rejection of 
Obama
's policy. But this is not about whether or not he's a one- or two-term president. This is about turning our 
country
 away from a fiscal cliff. We're in trouble, and we don't have time to play politics anymore. We have got to look at the 
federal government
, determine what it absolutely has to do, and then see if we can devolve power and spending back to the 
states
.
"
20,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, and I, I want to ask you about some specific areas of -- issue areas of the 
agenda
. Before I do that, another question about the 
tea party
. You were active in supporting 
tea party
 candidates around the 
country
. You had some, some big winners around the 
country
 that you campaigned for. There are some of them. But you also had some notable losses, particularly in the 
Senate
, and I want to single one out. You were behind 
Christine O'Donnell
, who lost, of course, in 
Delaware
. And here was the 
front page
 of the 
Wilmington News Journal
 on Wednesday after the 
election
. The banner headline, ""No taste for tea."" And frankly, there's been some backlash about your support for her. Politico reported it this way this
"
21,"
week:
""A bloc of prominent senators and operatives said 
party
 purists like 
Palin
 and Senator 
DeMint
 had foolishly pushed nominees too conservative to win in politically competitive 
states
. ... 'If you think what happened in 
Delaware
 is ""a win"" for the 
Republican Party
 then we don't have a snowball's chance to win the 
White House
,'"" that's 
Senator Lindsey Graham
, also from 
South Carolina
. ""'If you think 
Delaware
 was a wake-up call for 
Republicans
 then we have a shot at doing well for a long time.'"" Do you think the 
tea party
 actually cost the 
Republican Party
control
 of the 
Senate
?
"
22,"
SEN. DeMINT:
That is a very silly thing to say, 
David
. The 
tea party
 are responsible for just about every Republican who was elected around the 
country
. This time last year, if people'll 
think about it
, we were concerned about holding our own. Many thought 
Republicans
 would fall below 38 in, in the 
Senate
. So I supported all the Republican candidates, including 
Christine O'Donnell
. Unfortunately, she was so maligned by 
Republicans
, I don't think she ever had a chance. But we had historic gains in the 
Senate
 and in the 
House
, so...
"
23,"
MR. GREGORY:
Senator, you're not really saying that it was just lack of Republican support that tanked her candidacy, are you? This is a woman who said on 
national
 -- in an ad that she was not a witch.
"
24,"
SEN. DeMINT:
Well, I think we did see in the, in the wake of her 
primary
 win, a number of 
Republicans
 suggest she was not a viable candidate. That, that did make it difficult for her to start on the right foot. But all over the 
country
 we saw candidates like 
Pat Toomey
 in 
Pennsylvania
, 
Marco Rubio
 in 
Florida
, 
Rand Paul
 in 
Kentucky
, we saw candidates that were supported by a 
tea party
 in, in a new active wave of, of citizens change the face of the 
Senate
. This is what 
Republicans
 have needed for a long time, a new, 
young Republicans
, 
Cuban- American
 senator. We've got 
African-American
 congressmen. This is a huge change for the 
Republican Party
, and I think it's going to be very positive for our 
country
.
"
25,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. So, Senator, 
let me go
 down the list of important issues that I know you care about, and let's try to do this in, in -- 
a little bit more
 quickly than we might normally get some answers for you. On 
health care
, how do you go about dismantling it?
"
26,"
SEN. DeMINT:
Well, first of all we have to stop the funding of 
Obamacare
 and over the next two years show the 
American people
 what the 
real options
 are to improve the system we have now. I don't think 
Americans
 want to throw out our current system, they want to improve it. And there are a lot of ways we can make insurance more available, more affordable, available to those with pre-existing conditions. And we need to let the 
American people
 know that there are ways to do this without moving to the 
government
-
control system
. The first step is obviously to, to defund it, and I think we can do that with 
Republicans
 controlling the 
House
.
"
27,"
MR. GREGORY:
But do you think repeal is realistic?
"
28,"
SEN. DeMINT:
Yes, I do. I think the next Republican running for president needs to run on complete repeal of 
Obamacare
 because we really can't tweak it, 
David
. It's built on a platform of 
government
control
, and that doesn't really work in 
America
. We need a, a patient-physician system that's based more on competition and free markets. We really can't do that under this system that's so heavily prescribed in, in 
Obamacare
.
"
29,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, you're talking about the president in 
2012
, running for president. You don't really think that you can overcome a presidential veto of repealing 
health care
 in the 
Senate
, do you?
"
30,"
SEN. DeMINT:
Well, not before 
2012
. But we can certainly defund it. Most, most aspects of this new 
Obamacare
 are not implemented for two more years, so it's very realistic to think we can slow the implementation of it or delay it, and then replace it in 
2012
 with, with a 
real plan
 to improve 
health care
 in 
America
.
"
31,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, let me move to a few others. The cultural litmus test for 
Republicans
, I've been told, the earmark issue. This is pork barrel spending as part of the 
budget process
. You want them done away with, as do other 
tea party
 lawmakers and other 
Republicans
. But 
Mitch McConnell
, of course, the 
leader
 of the 
Republicans
 in the 
Senate
, was asked about it the other day, and this is what he said.
"
32,"

"
33,"
SEN. MITCH McCONNELL (R-KY):
As I think all of you know, you could eliminate every 
congressional
 earmark and it would save no 
money
. It's really an argument about discretion.
"
34,"

"
35,"
MR. GREGORY:
Doesn't sound like he's with you all the way. Is this a showdown coming for 
Republicans
?
"
36,"
SEN. DeMINT:
Well, it, it may be. But I think the 
message
 is clear from the 
American people
, and I know there's some senior members in 
Congress
 who think it's their job to take on bacon. But the real reason for the dysfunction of 
Congress
 right now is you have over 500 congressmen and senators who think they're there to bring home the bacon. It's kind of, ""To heck with 
America
, just give me the 
money
."" We can't do that anymore. Parochial politics needs to be out in 
Washington
.
"
37,"
MR. GREGORY:
But what about 
Leader McConnell
? He is not with you.
"
38,"
SEN. DeMINT:
We need to focus on...
"
39,"
MR. GREGORY:
He is suggesting that it's more a question of discretion. This is a 
leader
 of the 
Republicans
. Are you prepared to go toe-to-toe with him, and is this going to be a big showdown with your Republican 
leadership
?
"
40,"
SEN. DeMINT:
I don't think so. 
Mitch McConnell
 has voted twice for an earmark ban that I've proposed in the 
Senate
. Just about every Republican who is running for the 
Senate
 this time ran on a no earmark pledge. And we've had a vote where over half of our conference has voted for the ban before. Obviously, I'm hopeful I will have 
leadership
 support. But we've got a number of co-sponsors. 
Tom Coburn
 and I are leading the effort for this earmark ban, and, and we know 
John Boehner
 has committed to it in the 
House
. We're not going to have earmarks. So it's, it's really silly for some senior 
Republicans
 in the 
Senate
 to try to block it.
"
41,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. Let me ask you about another hot button issue, and that is the debt ceiling. Come spring 
Congress
 is going to have to vote to 
raise
 the debt ceiling because our debt is increasing and it's reaching the $4.3 
trillion
 limit that 
Congress
 has already set -- $14.3 
trillion
 limit that 
Congress
 set in February. Will you vote to increase the debt ceiling?
"
42,"
SEN. DeMINT:
No, I won't, not, not unless this debt ceiling is combined with some path to balancing our 
budget
, returning to 
2008
 spending levels, repealing 
Obamacare
. We have got to demonstrate that we have the resolve to cut spending. Now, we've already spent the 
money
, and raising the debt ceiling is just like paying off your credit card bill; but we cannot allow that to go through the 
Congress
 without showing the 
American people
 that we are going to 
balance
 the 
budget
 and we're not going to continue to 
raise
 the debt in 
America
.
"
43,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. Well, let me ask you specifically about that. Where would -- do you think the 
American people
 have to be prepared for 
sacrifice
? Which part of the 
budget
, knowing that there's only 15 percent that's nondiscretionery, or that's real -- nondefense discretionary part of the 
budget
, what are you going to target for cuts?
"
44,"
SEN. DeMINT:
Well, I don't think the 
American people
 are going to have to 
sacrifice
 as much as the 
government
 bureaucrats who get paid about twice what the American worker does. First of all, we just need to return to pre-
Obama
 levels of spending in 
2008
. We need to cut earmarks so people will quit focusing on taking home the bacon. We need to defund 
Obamacare
, and then we need to look at the entitlement programs, such as the way 
Paul Ryan
 has done in the 
House
 with his road maps to 
America
's future, to fix our 
tax code
, to fix 
Social Security
 and 
Medicare
, and to cut the cost 
over time
. We've got the plans, 
David
, to do this, we just -- we need to talk about them, we need to help the 
American people
 see where we're going...
"
45,"
MR. GREGORY:
But let me just...
"
46,"
SEN. DeMINT:
...but we can cut spending.
"
47,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me just stop you. I want to be very, very, very specific because going back to 
2008
 spending levels will not get anywhere close to balancing the 
budget
. So you're saying that everything has to be on the table -- cuts in defense, cuts in 
Medicare
, cuts in 
Social Security
. Is that right?
"
48,"
SEN. DeMINT:
Well, no, we're not talking about cuts in 
Social Security
. If we can just cut the administrative waste, we can cut hundreds of billions of dollars a year at the 
federal level
. So before we start cutting -- I mean, we need to keep our promises to seniors, 
David
, and cutting benefits to seniors is not on the table. Excuse me, let me grab a sip of water.
"
49,"
MR. GREGORY:
But then, but where, but where do you make the cuts? I mean, if you're protecting everything for those, the most potent 
political groups
 like seniors who go out and vote, where are you really going to 
balance
 the 
budget
?
"
50,"
SEN. DeMINT:
Well, look at 
Paul Ryan
's 
road map
 to the future. We see a clear path to moving back to a 
balanced budget
over time
. Again, the plans are on the table. We don't have to cut benefits for seniors, and we don't need to cut 
Medicare
 like, like the 
Democrats
 did in this big 
Obamacare
 bill. We can restore sanity in 
Washington
 without cutting any benefits to seniors or veterans.
"
51,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me ask you a final question about 
2012
. Who's got the 
inside track
 for president, and do you think 
tea party
 forces -- yourself, 
Sarah Palin
 -- have an 
inside track
 moving forward?
"
52,"
SEN. DeMINT:
Well, I think the, the, the voters have the 
inside track
 here. I think the 
citizen
 activism is going to change politics. I think 
Sarah Palin
 did an incredible amount of good to 
raise
 the interest level of what's going on in politics, so she did a lot for the 
Republican Party
, 
Michele Bachmann
, others. But we've got a, I think, a great list of folks, including the next 
person
 who'll be on your show, 
Chris Christie
, who's demonstrated a lot of courage. And probably more than anything else right now, 
David
, we need politicians with the courage to make very difficult decisions, to fight 
special interest groups
, and that's what I want to see in the next Republican nominee.
"
53,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. Senator 
DeMint
, 
thank you very much
 for joining us this morning.
"
54,"
SEN. DeMINT:
Thank you, 
David
.
"
55,"
MR. GREGORY:
We now turn to the aforementioned Republican who has emerged as a 
leader
 of his 
party
, 
New Jersey
 Governor 
Chris Christie
. Welcome to the program.
"
56,"
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ):
Thank you, 
David
.
"
57,"
MR. GREGORY:
Good to have you here.
"
58,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Happy to be here.
"
59,"
MR. GREGORY:
When you talk about the response from the voters on 
Election Day
, something's very curious. We know some of the feelings about the 
Democrats
, about 
President Obama
's 
policies
, but look at this from the 
exit polls
 in terms of the opinion of 
political parties
. 
Republicans
 didn't fare too well either; 52 percent unfavorable rating. What does that say about the 
Republican Party
 today?
"
60,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
You know, I think what it says is what I was saying all over the 
country
, that's it's 
put up or shut up
 time for our 
party
. You know, we lost our way last decade, 
David
, we did, and people expect us to do better. And if the 
Republican Party
 wants to come back, they're going to have to do what they said they were going to do. I mean, because if they don't, we're going to be sent to the wilderness for a long time, and we're going to deserve it.
"
61,"
MR. GREGORY:
What does that mean? What do they have to put up?
"
62,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
What they have to do is they say they want, and, and we're doing it in New
"
63,"
Jersey:
smaller 
government
, less spending, less regulation, lower 
taxes
. 
That's what
 the public is saying that they want. And if you look at what we've done in 
New Jersey
, 
David
, we're delivering on that. We're not fixed yet, but we're on the track to being fixed, closing an $11 billion 
budget deficit
 without any new or increased 
taxes
, cutting the corporate 
business tax
. We're doing things to try to create an environment where 
private sector
 jobs can grow.
"
64,"
MR. GREGORY:
And, and I want to talk about some of the 
choices
 you made in 
New Jersey
. But, you know, you heard Senator 
DeMint
, and there's a lot of 
Republicans
 talking about cutting the deficit, cutting the 
budget
, but they're not specific. He wasn't specific. He talks about 
Paul Ryan
, who has some ideas about 
Medicare
 and changing the way that's structured, indeed, making some cuts. 
Paul Ryan
 in the 
House
, he's from 
Wisconsin
, doesn't have support among establishment 
Republicans
. There are 15 
Republicans
 who stood up behind him in terms of making these cuts. Are 
Republicans
 really making good when Senator 
DeMint
 and others aren't specific about the cuts they're going to make to entitlements or to defense, to the big 
ticket
 items that really move the 
budget
?
"
65,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Well, let me tell you what's -- where the 
leadership
's going to come from. You have 11 Republican 
governors
 and a Democratic governor, 
Andrew Cuomo
 in 
New York
, who have said we can't 
raise
taxes
 and we have to cut spending in everything. In 
New Jersey
 what we did was we cut spending in every department, a 9 percent cut in real spending, not projected spending, real spending year over year. Find another 
state
 that did that and, and we'll go and 
talk about it
. I mean, we made real hard decisions, and I cut some programs that we would've liked to have kept.
"
66,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
67,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
But we're broke. We don't have the 
money
 anymore. And so I hope that what these 
governors
, 
Republicans
 and 
Democrats
, will show 
Washington
 is you can do this and you have to do it.
"
68,"
MR. GREGORY:
I asked Senator 
DeMint
 about 
sacrifice
, and he said, 'Oh, we don't want to, we don't want to break our promise to our seniors. In your 
state
, what are you telling people they have to 
sacrifice
 and what do 
Republicans
 around the 
country
 have to tell 
Americans
 they have to 
sacrifice
 if they want to bring the size of 
government
 under 
control
 and the deficit under 
control
?
"
69,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
We told everybody there has to be shared 
sacrifice
 among everyone, and let me be specific. We cut every 
department of state
government
. We cut funding to K to 12 education. We are proposed real pension and benefit reforms on 
public sector
 workers, increasing the retirement age, eliminating 
COLAs
, things that are really going to bring the pension 
problem
 back under 
control
. We cut all of this spending in the 
state
 in every 
state department
, 
David
, every 
state department
. From environmental protection, to military and 
veterans affairs
, all the way through had to sustain a cut. Those are the type of things you have to do to 
show people
 you really mean shared 
sacrifice
. Everyone came to the table and everybody had to contribute.
"
70,"
MR. GREGORY:
So, as you, as a 
national Republican
 with 
national
 influence now -- and you've met with 
congressional
Republicans
 and talked about issues -- does everything have to be on the table?
"
71,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
What I told them was they'd better come up with a plan that's credible like we did in 
New Jersey
, and the public's going to be able to smell real quickly if you're not credible. And if we are not credible, then we are really going to be in trouble as a 
party
, and I think the numbers you showed indicate that.
"
72,"
MR. GREGORY:
What about the 
tea party
, the 
tea party
's influence on the 
Republican party
? 
Net positive
, net negative? What do you think?
"
73,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:

Net positive
. Listen, the core that drives the 
tea party
, in my view, are those four principles I talked about before -- less spending, smaller 
government
 and less intrusive 
government
, lower regulation, and lower 
taxes
. And when 
Republicans
 are at their best, those are our core principles. And so I think that, at bottom, it's a positive influence. Listen, you're going to have variances around, around the 
country
. I endorsed 
Mike Castle
 in the 
primary
...
"
74,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right, in 
Delaware
.
"
75,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Yes.
"
76,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
77,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Because I felt he was the best 
person
.
"
78,"
MR. GREGORY:
Is that a wake -- do you agree with 
Lindsey Graham
 from 
South Carolina
 or 
Jim DeMint
 from 
South Carolina
, that 
Delaware
 is a wake-up call for 
Republicans
?
"
79,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
I think 
Delaware
 was a missed opportunity to have a really good 
United States senator
 in 
Mike Castle
, and that's why I endorsed him in the 
primary
.
"
80,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me talk 
a little bit more
 about 
New Jersey
 and 
taxes
 and spending. 
And I
 want to talk specifically about the -- this 
ARC
 tunnel, this 
rail tunnel
 that would've connected 
New York
 and 
New Jersey
 and the controversy surrounding this. To boil all of this down, the 
federal government
, as I understand it, offered you a deal. You were worried about cost, 
cost overruns
, and they said, ""Look, we're going to take care of that. 
New Jersey
's not going to be responsible."" So critics have used...
"
81,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Whoa, let me stop you right there.
"
82,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah.
"
83,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
No chance. That never happened. The 
federal government
 said $3 billion is what they were going to give us, and I had to sign a contract saying every nickel over $3 billion was the responsibility of the 
federal government
. All the 
federal government
 offered me in the interim two week period, between the time when I first canceled the tunnel, was the ability to get 
federal
 loans...
"
84,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
85,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
...that we'd have to pay back.
"
86,"
MR. GREGORY:
They weren't going to shift this to...
"
87,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
No.
"
88,"
MR. GREGORY:
...private companies to be able to take care of it?
"
89,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
No. It was 
federal
 loans or, if we wanted a public-private partnership, we had to have increased fees on all the train tickets, for all the commuters, all across 
New Jersey
, including ones that weren't using the tunnel, to be able to repay it. No matter what, 
David
, this was going to fall on the people of the 
state of New Jersey
, and the worst part was, it was a 
blank check
. No one could tell me how much this was going to cost. We had already put $5.7 billion up from the 
state of New Jersey
, and we were talking about $2 billion to $5 billion in overruns now. I mean, we could not sustain that. We're broke.
"
90,"
MR. GREGORY:
Is this a matter of ideology for you, or simply a pragmatic issue that you don't have the 
money
? And by that I mean, should the 
federal government
 be involved in big infrastructure projects like this?
"
91,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Sure, they should. And you know what? I gave the 
federal government
 two weeks to 
come back to me
 and say if this is a project of such 
national
 importance, then put more 
money
 on the table for it. But, you know, they didn't. In, in 
Florida
, where they're building 
high speed rail
, 
Florida
's being asked to give a 20 percent match to an 80 percent for 
federal
. In this project, 
New Jersey
 was picking up 70 percent of the cost, the feds 30 percent and nothing from the 
state
 or the city of 
New York
. Listen, this is about fairness and about what we could afford, and I'm not going to sign blank checks on the taxpayers in the 
state of New Jersey
 for a project that, as laudable as it might be in some respects, we simply can't afford now. When we talked to the campaign, 
David
, about tough 
choices
, this is an example.
"
92,"
MR. GREGORY:

Tax cuts
. You've got a millionaires tax in 
New Jersey
, which I know that you're opposed to.
"
93,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Not anymore, we don't.
"
94,"
MR. GREGORY:
Not anymore because...
"
95,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
No.
"
96,"
MR. GREGORY:
...you vetoed it.
"
97,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Yes.
"
98,"
MR. GREGORY:
You've got high 
taxes
 across the board.
"
99,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
We do.
"
100,"
MR. GREGORY:
How do you deal with that as a Republican governor of 
New Jersey
?
"
101,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Well, first you say, ""No more."" And the 
Democrats
 sent me an extension of the millionaires tax that would have not only hit individuals but 
small business
 in 
New Jersey
, and I vetoed it. 
And I
'm not going to increase 
taxes
 on the 
state
 that the 
Tax Foundation
 has said is the highest burdened tax 
state
 in 
America
, especially if you look at our unemployment rate, 
David
, ours is higher than any 
state
 in our region. The reason is, over the last eight years under 
Corzine
 and 
McGreevey
, we raised 
taxes
 and fees 115 times. We put a wet blanket on the 
economy
 of 
New Jersey
, and that's why our people are still out of work disproportionately to 
everybody else
 in the region. 
New York
 is a point lower. 
Pennsylvania
 is more than a point lower. I mean, we, you know, we did this to ourselves with all these increased 
taxes
.
"
102,"
MR. GREGORY:
What about the 
Bush tax cuts
 and extending those? You've said that should happen at all levels for a couple of years, but you've said only a couple of years because there is a 
day of reckoning
 here. Can you have 
tax cuts
 when you also want to 
balance
 the, the 
budget
? Or do you have to consider tax increases at the 
federal level
 at some point?
"
103,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Well, you know, I've been watching you for weeks talk about extending the 
Bush tax cuts
. Drives me crazy when I'm sitting at home. This is about maintaining the current tax structure in a time we have a very weak 
economy
. And so I favor extending these for another two years, extending the current 
tax system
 and not having a tax increase...
"
104,"
MR. GREGORY:
But those, I mean, wait a minute. It may drive you crazy, and I know other 
Republicans
 that feel the same way. But I've also talked to 
Republicans
. I've talked to economists like 
Alan Greenspan
 who say there is no free lunch here. You cannot have 
tax cuts
 at this level and not have them be paid for. And other 
Republicans
 say, yes, they should be pay for. So you do agree they should be paid for.
"
105,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Well, obviously -- well, listen, I've, I'm walking the walk in 
New Jersey
, 
David
.
"
106,"
MR. GREGORY:
OK.
"
107,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
I mean, when I said we're vetoing the millionaires tax, I found spending tax to pay for that.
"
108,"
MR. GREGORY:
So you can have existing 
tax policy
, but it still has to be offset.
"
109,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Well, listen, and I'm not disagreeing with you, 
David
.
"
110,"
MR. GREGORY:
OK.
"
111,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
But I'm -- what I'm disagreeing with you is you characterizing what's happening here as a -- as 
tax cuts
. This is maintaining the current 
tax policy
 in a weak 
economy
, and what you're, what you're advocating through your question is tax increases.
"
112,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right. I'm not -- that's not fair. I'm not advocating. I'm, I'm questioning whether or not they have to be paid for.
"
113,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Well, when you call the, when you call the 
tax cuts
, what I'm saying is the -- I take the position as the opposite of that.
"
114,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right. Right.
"
115,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
The opposite of that is it is a tax increase in a weakened...
"
116,"
MR. GREGORY:
But they are set to expire.
"
117,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
...weaks in, in a weakened 
economy
. And what I'm saying is you should keep the current tax structure in place until our 
economy
 gets stronger.
"
118,"
MR. GREGORY:
That's fine. But they're set to expire, so if you're going to re-authorize them, they're, they're, you're voting for 
tax cuts
.
"
119,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
No, you're not voting for 
tax cuts
. You're voting to maintain the current tax structure.
"
120,"
MR. GREGORY:
I understand, a continuation.
"
121,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
That's a...
"
122,"
MR. GREGORY:
But there's...
"
123,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
And then we agree.
"
124,"
MR. GREGORY:
And there's still an offset issue.
"
125,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Well, then we agree.
"
126,"
MR. GREGORY:
OK. The, the issue of where there's room for negotiation, is there room for negotiation in your mind? Should the president make a deal here on, on these things for a certain period of time? Does everybody, then, in a couple of years have to come to this and say, ""Maybe these aren't the best ideas. Maybe we also have to think about tax increases at some point""?
"
127,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Well, I think the first thing that the president has to focus on is building 
private sector
 jobs again in this 
country
. 
And I
 don't think, by increasing 
taxes
, that's the way to -- that we're going to get it done in the short term. And so, sure, there's areas for compromise, I'm sure there are, between Republican leaders in the 
Congress
 and the president. But the president has to lead on this. 
And I
 think that the 
message
 is really clear, I got the 
message
 from the 
election
, it's about putting people back to work. And you will not put people back to work in 
private sector
 jobs by increasing the cost in the 
private sector
.
"
128,"
MR. GREGORY:
A couple more areas. I want to -- you've become an 
YouTube
 star, as you well know, because you've had some, some interactions with voters, including when you were campaigning for 
Meg Whitman
 out in 
California
. Let me show that moment.
"
129,"

"
130,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
You know what, you want to yell, yell at me, but don't give her a 
hard time
. We're here. We're here talking about the future of the 
state of California
 and the future of our 
country
. And you know what?
"
131,"
Unidentified Man:
And you're just talking about the truth that's she's lying about.
"
132,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
And you know what? And you know what? Let me tell you, and let me tell you this. You know what? It's people who 
raise
 their voices and yell and scream like you that are dividing this 
country
. We're here to bring this 
country
 together, not to divide it.
"
133,"

"
134,"
MR. GREGORY:
So what's the 
balance
? On to a style question. The 
balance
 for you being a straight talker, you know, taking on the corrosive conversations we have about politics, and then your image as being a little too brusque, bullying, you know, Governor 
Wrecking Ball
? How do you, how do you straddle that line?
"
135,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Well, 
I am who I am
. I don't straddle the line. 
And I
 think what people in 
New Jersey
 appreciate about, appreciate about me is I don't send smoke signals. They know who I am. They know how I feel about issues. Sometimes they agree with and sometimes they don't, but all I think that that clip indicates is that when I have 
something on my mind
, I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it directly. 
And I
 think that we have too little of that in politics, 
David
. And when, when I sit around and watch the way some people in 
political life
 talk, it, it fogs me over. 
And I
 think it fogs people in 
America
 over too. They want to hear somebody say, ""If you feel a certain way, say it and live with the consequences."" I'm willing to let the chips fall where they may on that issue.
"
136,"
MR. GREGORY:
So the question is whether you're going to say all this stuff at a 
national
 level. You've ruled out running for president in 
2012
. But you're also acting like a guy who's increasing your 
national
 influence. You're campaigning for 
congressional
Republicans
. Why do all of that? Why, especially in tight races, if you're not looking down the line at running?
"
137,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Because I care about my 
country
, and because I felt that those people where the absolute best candidates to help make our 
country
 a 
better place
. And so that's why I campaigned for them. I have no other 
agenda
. And to the extent that 
New Jersey
 over the last year can serve as an example to people that say, ""Listen, you can cut spending. You can 
balance
 a 
budget
 without tax increases. You can make hard 
choices
 and not only survive politically but thrive politically."" Then I want to try to set that example for folks so that these other new 
governors
 who are coming in, members of 
Congress
...
"
138,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
139,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
...that they will act boldly and be strong.
"
140,"
MR. GREGORY:
Shermanesque statement, you're not running in 
2012
?
"
141,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Absolutely.
"
142,"
MR. GREGORY:
You wouldn't be on a 
ticket
 at all as 
VP
?
"
143,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:

Can you see me
 as somebody's vice president, 
David
, after, after that question about governor 
wrecking ball
? I would feel bad for that poor man or woman.
"
144,"
MR. GREGORY:
What about down the line, beyond 
2012
? What, what criteria would you use in making a decision about whether to run for president?
"
145,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Well, first I have to decide whether I run for re-
election
 in 
2013
 in 
New Jersey
, and that's going to be determined by how good a job I do and whether the people in the 
state of New Jersey
 want me back. So before you ever get to anything beyond that, you know, my mother always taught me first things first. Do your job. Do your job that the people of 
New Jersey
 gave you. I love being governor and I'm got to be governor until 
2013
, then we'll see what the verdict of the people is of the job I did on 
2013
.
"
146,"
MR. GREGORY:
So fair at least to say the door is open beyond 
2012
.
"
147,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
I'm going to need a job, 
David
, after 
2013
, you know? And so whether it's going to be being governor of 
New Jersey
 or doing something else, I have four kids between 7 and 17, I'm working the rest of my life anyway. So it's going to be doing something, 
David
, so maybe it'll be that. Who knows.
"
148,"
MR. GREGORY:
Governor 
Christie
, 
thank you very much
.
"
149,"
GOV. CHRISTIE:
Thank you, 
David
.
"

MR. GREGORY:
Coming up, our 
political
roundtable
 weighs in on the road ahead for 
President Obama
 after what he called a ""shellacking"" on 
Election Day
, after this brief 
commercial break
.
"

"

MR. GREGORY:
We are back. 
We are
 -- and they're already talking, our 
political
roundtable
, to break down what happened on Tuesday and where we go from here. Joining me now, president of the 
National Urban League
, 
Marc Morial
; Republican strategist and adviser to 
Meg Whitman
's gubernatorial campaign in 
California
 -- we'll talk about that -- 
Mike Murphy
; counselor to 
President Bush
, 
Karen Hughes
; and 
President Obama
's former communications adviser, 
Anita Dunn
. Welcome to all of you.
"
155,"
MR. MARC MORIAL:
Thanks, 
David
.
"
156,"
MS. ANITA DUNN:
Good morning.
"
157,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, I, I want to start. I mean, what a, what a week and what an 
Election Day
. But I want to talk specifically about 
President Obama
's reaction to all of this. And it was striking to me, 
Anita Dunn
, as you worked in the 
White House
, that the president appeared to be struggling in that press conference, sort of working through the fact that he's struggling to connect to the 
American people
 two years after such an important victory. He talked about some 
leadership
 failures. He's appearing on ""
60 Minutes
"" tonight, and this is what -- part of what he told 
Steve Kroft
.
"
158,"

"
159,"
PRES. OBAMA:
I think it's a fair argument. I -- you know, I think that, over the course of two years, we were so busy and so focused on getting 
a bunch of stuff
 done that we stopped paying attention to the fact that, you know, 
leadership
 isn't just legislation, that it's a matter of persuading people and giving them confidence and bringing them together, making an argument that people can understand. 
And I
 think that we 
haven
't always been successful at that, and I take personal responsibility for that.
"
160,"

"
161,"
MR. GREGORY:
You know, my colleague 
Savannah Guthrie
, covering the 
White House
, I
"
162,"
thought asked the most important question:
Does the president get it?
"
163,"
MS. DUNN:
Well, listen, I think that what 
President Obama
 said is, is absolutely correct, which is he came into office facing great policy challenges, and with those policy challenges came great communications challenges. 
And I
 think many people say, you know, in terms of the policy, in terms of the immediate crisis, in terms of keeping this 
country
 from sliding into a depression that, you know, this administration's done a very good job. In terms of kind of outlining to a very, to a very worried, frustrated and increasingly angry 
American people
 what comes next and where's that 
better place
 -- 
and I
 was part of that communications operation -- you know, obviously that's a challenge that we didn't quite get to as we did for the policy one. But here's, here's the reality, 
David
, which is for two years with 
Democrats
 controlling everything, it was kind of 
Democrats
 against 
Democrats
 and a referendum, there's now going to be a very clear choice in this town, and I think that the communications challenge...
"
164,"
MR. GREGORY:
But we're not -- but, 
Anita
, we're not there yet.
"
165,"
MS. DUNN:
No, but it actually gets a little easier here, so -- 
uh-huh
.
"
166,"
MR. GREGORY:
But I'm still grappling with -- yeah. But, but, but, 
Karen
, I mean, there, there was -- I detected a certain level of impatience and irritation, even, on the president's part that 
Americans
 don't seem to get what's been done for them.
"
167,"
AMB. KAREN HUGHES:
He was very uncomfortable. And sometimes, 
David
, you have a communications 
problem
, and sometimes you just have a 
problem
. This was a massive repudiation of the president's 
policies
. And frankly, it's a little insulting for him to suggest he wasn't able to persuade us, as if we're so stupid that we just don't get how brilliant his 
policies
 were. No, we don't like his 
policies
. We don't like the 
trillion
-
dollar
 stimulus and the 
trillion
- 
dollar
 massive 
health care
 at a time of enormous anxiety. We need to -- and, and the proof to me, 
David
, that he really wasn't getting the 
message
 was when he talked about tweaking. This was not a tweak 
election
, this was a ""Turn this baby around, we are on the wrong course""...
"
168,"
MR. GREGORY:

Marc Morial
, what do you say?
"
169,"
MR. MORIAL:
It was not a ""turn this baby around 
election
"" because when you look at the 
exit polls
, the 
exit poll
 said something different. They showed a sharply divided 
nation
 on issues like 
health care
. They showed a sharply divided 
nation
. The wrong thing to do with this 
election
 is to overstate the results. You -- and there was a mistake in 
2008
 to overstate the results, and I think it's a mistake in 
2010
 to overstate the results. 
The fact of the matter
 is. it was a repudiation of the Democratic and the 
Republican Parties
 if you look at favorability ratings coming out of the 
exit polls
.
"
170,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right, we showed that.
"
171,"
MR. MORIAL:
And you saw a sharply divided 
country
 about the issue of 
health care
. I think the president gets it. Every great champion, every great president at some point gets pushed to the ropes, may get knocked down to a knee. 
President Obama
 will get up, he will fight back, he will stand on his principles. It was a tough week. Anyone who's been through a tough 
political
 loss knows the feeling in your gut, the re-examination you go through, and I think he's going through that. But I think it's wrong to look at it as some sort of 
mandate
. And we want to do that, claim a great victory when in fact the 
nation
 is...
"
172,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right. Well, but here, here's my question, 
Mike Murphy
. We know that 
Americans
 voted their economic anxiety.
"
173,"
MR. MIKE MURPHY:
Mm-hmm.
"
174,"
MR. GREGORY:
But they also did make a statement about their desire or lack thereof of the role of 
government
 in our lives, particularly in an...
"
175,"
MR. MURPHY:
Mm-hmm.
"
176,"
MR. GREGORY:
...this, this period of economic upheaval. And it seems to me the president struggled all throughout these first two years making the argument and winning the argument that 
government
 was part of the answer, part of the solution, not part of the 
problem
.
"
177,"
MR. MURPHY:
Yeah, we just had a referendum on that -- excuse me -- and the president lost, and he lost by historic proportions. So I think he knows he got shellacked, the 
problem
 is publicly what to say about it, because when your ideological point of view is totally repudiated, it's kind of hard to have much to say. So what the president has to do now is reset the clock and get a forward-going 
message
 because there's no backward-going 
message
 that's going to help him at all. 
And I
 think he's got two 
choices
, either hunker down and kind of have a passive plan and hope the 
Republicans
 repeat the mistakes of 
1994
 and act like they've just won 
control
 of the 
government
, which I don't -- I think we've learned from that mistake and we won't do it again; or he's got to make a big move where he grabs the 
agenda
 again and makes tremendously painful for him but politically effective and I would think economically effective policy compromises. That's the choice.
"
178,"
AMB. HUGHES:
But the irony is, but the irony is that a president who really owes much of his presidency to the power of his words -- 
and I
 was among those who was inspired by his words in 
2008
 even though I disagree with his 
policies
 -- those words have lost their power because he's used them so carelessly. For example, calling for civility the day after the 
election
, an 
election
 in which he called his opponents enemies and told 
Republicans
 we had to sit in the backseat of the car. I think he's, he's carelessly used words. He, he gratuitously took a lot of 
political
 shots in this 
election
, and so his calls for civility, his calls for -- his, his -- he's lost the power of his words, and that, that makes it very hard for him to set an 
agenda
.
"
179,"
MR. MURPHY:
Yeah...
"
180,"
MS. DUNN:

David
, I, I, I -- yeah, but I, I want to talk about words for a second because on Tuesday night we saw the Republican 
leadership
 saying that they were humbled, they understood there wasn't a 
mandate
, and since then all they've done is claim a 
mandate
 for 
policies
 that, frankly, weren't borne out by the people who showed up and by the 
exit polls
 you've cited. For instance, as 
Marc
 pointed out, even with this very conservative electorate that showed up to vote on Tuesday night, support for either repealing or keeping the healthcare program is split 47-48. There is not a 
mandate
 for rolling it back. 
Fifty-two
 percent of those voters felt that some or all of those 
Bush tax cuts
 should not be renewed. And, and so I say to myself, you know, the 
Republicans
 are now trying to create a 
mandate
 where none exists, and the reality is that the vote was very much a rejection of the status quo. I mean, the status quo's been on the ballot for three times now, and it loses every time.
"
181,"
MR. MURPHY:
But, but if the 
Democrats
 want to litigate 
exit polls
 and put 
Speaker Pelosi
 back in the front window, it is the biggest gift to the 
Republican Party
 since the elephant. What the, the president's either going to do is he -- we're all going to sit here in pundit land and chew him to pieces if he wants to talk about how he lost the 
election
, because he's not particularly good at humility and contrition. That is not his core skill. He's got to decide to finally, what he hasn't done for two years, is get big, be the biggest guy in politics, not be passive to the 
Democrats
 in 
Congress
 -- who, by the way, have gone even farther left with these 
election
 results -- and grab the whole thing, or he's going to be diminished and do very, very badly.
"
182,"
MR. MORIAL:
Well, you know, I think the other thing, too, is I don't know if there's an appetite to relitigate things like 
health care
. Because if you look at the, the 
exit polling
, there's a split. And the question is, as I looked at 
Jim DeMint
, is it seemed to be -- he seemed to be suggesting that there is ""another plan."" I'd like to ""see that plan.""
"
183,"
MR. GREGORY:
There's no plan. He made it very clear, the plan is to run on this in 
2010
. They don't -- 
the Republicans
 don't have support to get rid of 
health care
 now.
"
184,"
MR. MORIAL:
It's -- what it is, is it's a 
political
 plan.
"
185,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
186,"
MR. MORIAL:
It's not a plan to address the problems in our 
nation
.
"
187,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, but, but here's, but here's a 
political question
. 
Alex Sink
, she ran for governor down in 
Florida
 and lost, which the 
White House
 was not happy about -- lost narrowly, by the way, to a flawed Republican candidate who put a lot of his own 
money
 in there. She said, ""Look, the 
White House
 was 
tone deaf
; 
tone deaf
 on response to the gulf oil spill, 
tone deaf
 on lack of acceptance to 
health care
."" I mean, there are people, including 
Democrats
, the way they ran, who felt that 
health care
 ultimately was a war of choice and not a war of necessity for 
Obama
.
"
188,"
MR. MORIAL:
And, you know, 
David
, there, there's merit into the notion that the 
White House
 needs to make some modifications and make some changes to how they communicate and how they undertake it. So here's my prescription. My prescription is that they've got to focus like a laser in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night on jobs, jobs, jobs. What I hear around the 
country
 when I travel the 
nation
, from all sorts of groups of people, is they want a plan for jobs and 
economic growth
. If the leaders of both sides can come together around a plan for jobs and 
economic growth
, I think that would be in the 
best interests
 of the 
nation
. If this is going to simply be a tactical discussion about what 
political
 move helps you in 
2012
...
"
189,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
190,"
MR. MORIAL:
...both parties are risking, risking that you're going to have another volatile 
election
.
"
191,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, but let -- I want to get, I want to get one more thing in before the break. 
Karen
, as a, as a professional here, not just, you know, with your 
political
 leanings, 
President Bush
 in '06 takes a thumping, as he says, in the polls, fires 
Don Rumsfeld
, and then proceeds to, to move into the surge, which 
Democrats
 didn't like. He was at a different point at his presidency.
"
192,"
MS. DUNN:
It was a very different point, the presidency was, right.
"
193,"
MR. GREGORY:
He could do something different here. What is the road back for 
President Obama
? What's the, the line between consensus building and actually pushing the 
Republicans
 away and forcing a show down?
"
194,"
AMB. HUGHES:
I think the more instructive model is what 
Bill Clinton
 did after the 
1994
election
. When he was two years in, he went back to the middle. He moderated his positions and 
policies
. He reached out to 
Republicans
. There were some contentious times and -- with 
Newt Gingrich
, but he reached out to 
Republicans
, and he came back to the center. And that is what the 
American people
 are fundamentally saying. You -- 
President Obama
 talked a lot about the car in the ditch during this 
election
. Well, the voters kicked the tires and they said we're going to turn this baby around because what we got home with is not what we were sold. This is not -- the 
trillion
dollar
 stimulus, the, the massive complex healthcare plan, which, by the way, has an impact on jobs. Employers aren't hiring because they're afraid of the uncertainty of what that healthcare plan will do to their business and...
"
195,"
MR. MORIAL:
And 
health care
 is the only sector of the 
economy
 creating jobs.
"
196,"
MS. DUNN:
Right.
"
197,"
MR. MURPHY:
Mm-hmm.
"
198,"
MR. MORIAL:
I mean, that's the point about it is that the healthcare sector is, indeed, creating jobs.
"
199,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
200,"
MS. DUNN:
But, 
David
, you know, in -- 
let's not
 forget that they weren't able to move to some kind of consensus until after the 
Republicans
 had shut down the 
government
, that 
1995
 was the year in which 
Democrats
 drew a very 
hard line
 with Republican priorities. 
Republicans
 felt they'd come in with a 
mandate
 that they actually didn't have from the voters, to come in. And what you're seeing right now I think is 
Republicans
 coming in and there are parts of their 
party
 that are -- think they actually did get sent here with a real 
mandate
 to do some things and that you don't actually get to consensus...
"
201,"
MR. GREGORY:
Hm.
"
202,"
MS. DUNN:
...until you've had to make those hard 
choices
.
"
203,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, I'm going to take a break here.
"
204,"
MS. DUNN:
Yes.
"
205,"
MR. GREGORY:
I want to come back, talk about the 
agenda
 ahead. I also want to talk about the 
tea party
's influence in that showdown that's coming up between tea partyers and the establishment 
Republicans
. Back more with our 
roundtable
 when we come back right after this break.
"
206,"

"
207,"
MR. GREGORY:
We are back with our 
roundtable
. 
Mike Murphy
, I want to ask about the 
tea party
, but I've got to ask you, first...
"
208,"
MR. MURPHY:
Sure.
"
209,"
MR. GREGORY:
...you were with 
Meg Whitman
.
"
210,"
MR. MURPHY:
I was.
"
211,"
MR. GREGORY:
What happened in 
California
? You thought this would be closer. In the end, it wasn't.
"
212,"
MR. MURPHY:
It wasn't. We got beat and, you know, I ran the campaign, and I take responsibility for it. It's a very 
blue state
 and it's getting bluer. As the red, you know, wave kind of went one way, there was a bit of a blue riptide coming the other way. We had a tough time in 
Washington state
 and 
Oregon
 and definitely in 
California
. 
And I
 think the other thing is that CEO candidates who are doing kind of a tough medicine 
message
, be it, you know, 
Linda McMahon
 in 
Connecticut
 in a 
blue state
...
"
213,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
214,"
MR. MURPHY:
...
Charlie Baker
 in 
Massachusetts
, 
Meg
 and 
Carly Fiorina
 in 
California
, they weren't buying it. So we just couldn't get there. We could win the 
Republicans
, win the independents, but in 
California
 if you don't win a lot of 
Democrats
...
"
215,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
216,"
MR. MURPHY:
...you don't win and we did not.
"
217,"
MR. GREGORY:
A hundred and sixty million dollars, though.
"
218,"
MR. MURPHY:
Right.
"
219,"
MR. GREGORY:
It seemed to be a referendum on 
big money
 candidates coming in and swaying voters.
"
220,"
MR. MURPHY:

Money
 became part of it, but it's a -- it's a 
Hobson's choice
 for 
Republicans
 in 
California
 because the big unions in the last couple of years have spent $300 million on politics. So you either can't 
raise
 enough 
money
 to compete and they swamp you -- because the public employee unions run 
California politics
, they paid for 
Jerry Brown
's campaign -- or you spend your own 
money
. But if you're a self-funder, the press wants to make that 
money
 the issue.
"
221,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. Well, let's talk...
"
222,"
MR. MURPHY:
So, you know, with a 
time machine
, there are a lot of 
things you can do
 differently, I'm proud of 
Meg.
 We fought hard for jobs, take on that 
pension system
. We had some tough answers that people just didn't want.
"
223,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me stay with you on the 
tea party
...
"
224,"
MR. MURPHY:
Yeah.
"
225,"
MR. GREGORY:
...because if you look at this on the coast, 
Democrats
 remain strong, in the heartland of the county, it was a real route.
"
226,"
MR. MURPHY:
Mm-hmm.
"
227,"
MR. GREGORY:
That's part of the 
tea party
's strength...
"
228,"
MR. MURPHY:
Mm-hmm.
"
229,"
MR. GREGORY:
...
white
, 
working class
 voters...
"
230,"
MR. MURPHY:
Right.
"
231,"
MR. GREGORY:
...the ones who voted for 
Hillary Clinton
, for instance.
"
232,"
MR. MURPHY:
Sure.
"
233,"
MR. GREGORY:
But what is -- what kind of fight are we going to see among 
Republicans
 with the 
tea party
 influence in 
Congress
?
"
234,"
MR. MURPHY:
Well, you know, a lot of the 
tea party
 is just fiscal conservatism, which is a 
totally positive
 force, and that was a lot of the 
message
. I think the media tends to kind of grab a part of the 
tea party
, the ""funnier the hat the better,"" and vilify them. So I think we've got to be careful as we look at this not to, not to have an analysis that doesn't look at all the voters, the 15 percent of the 
country
 or more who say they identify. That said, we've got some problems. I've got a bone to pick with 
Jim DeMint
. I, I take the position of many Republican senators, in some ways, he was 
Harry Reid
's secret weapon. You don't go into 
Delaware
 as a 
party leader
, gin up a 
primary
. You know, primaries can do whatever they want and -- but then in a 
Northeastern state
, we threw away a perfectly good 
Senate
 seat.
"
235,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
236,"
MR. MURPHY:
Similar situation in 
Nevada
. We could be at 49 or 50 seats right now. So I think there has to be some level of pragmatism inside the 
party
leadership
 to provide some guidance here because I don't want to throw away 
Senate
 seats. 
And I
 think it was a mistake.
"
237,"
MR. GREGORY:
What, 
Karen Hughes
, what about the accountability, for a moment, of the 
Republicans
 on where they are going to cut the 
budget
. They're making some big promises. Are they going to cut the 
prescription drug
 benefit that 
Bush
 passed? You know, are they going to deal with, with some of this spending? You know, 
President Bush
 tried private accounts in 
Social Security
. It did not work, and it was his own 
party
 that part of the big 
problem
 there.
"
238,"
AMB. HUGHES:
Well, I think we have to earn trust, and I think now that we 
control
 the 
House
, we have an opportunity to take votes and to pass legislation every week. We need to, we need to cut spending, we need to say that there's not going to be a $6 
trillion
tax cut
 that would kill jobs and hurt the, the fledgling economic recovery on -- and that needs to be our priority one. We need to, to offer solutions. We can start with, perhaps, not authorizing the stimulus spending that hasn't been spent.
"
239,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
240,"
AMB. HUGHES:
It's clearly not worked. Unemployment's stuck at 9.6 percent, although the president promised it wouldn't go over 8, and so it's not working.
"
241,"
MR. GREGORY:
But...
"
242,"
AMB. HUGHES:
And so we need to, we need to begin to earn trust. And let me make one more point, 
David
.
"
243,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yes.
"
244,"
AMB. HUGHES:
Much has been made of the fact that we 
control
 the 
House
 and not the 
Senate
. However, we have 47 
Republicans
 now in the 
Senate
 and there are 23 
Democrats
 who have to run for 
election
 in 
2012
 and who are going to listen to the 
message
 of this 
election
...
"
245,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
246,"
AMB. HUGHES:
...and perhaps be a little worried about voting...
"
247,"
MR. GREGORY:

Republicans
 and 
Democrats
, by the way.
"
248,"
AMB. HUGHES:
...about voting against spending cuts...
"
249,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah.
"
250,"
AMB. HUGHES:
...and limiting 
government
 in the next two years.
"
251,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, but let's talk about 
tax policy
.
"
252,"
AMB. HUGHES:
So I don't buy that we can't get things passed.
"
253,"
MR. GREGORY:

Mark Morial
, let's talk about 
tax policy
.
"
254,"
MR. MORIAL:
Hm.
"
255,"
MR. GREGORY:
Because you know, you could be for all the 
tax cuts
 across the board, 
Republicans
 and 
Democrats
 have to come to grips with the fact that you may have to 
raise
taxes
 if you really want to bring the 
budget
 under 
control
 at some point.
"
256,"
MR. MORIAL:
A lot of this is what I call ""
Star Wars
"" economics. ""Let's cut spending, let's cut 
taxes
, and let's also 
balance
 the 
budget
."" And the 
reality check
 is that you can't cut, tax your way out of the debt problems that face -- I'm part of an effort that's going to release a report soon on debt reduction and there's some very difficult 
choices
 to be made. But let me say this about the 
Bush tax cuts
 and my thinking. My thinking is to -- that the plan needs to be recast. It's a 
2001
tax cut
 plan that was designed as a stimulus to the recession that was taking place. Why can't we develop a new tax plan that might place greater tax relief for those at the middle and working levels? This tax plan gave those at the middle and working levels scant relief and gave greater relief to those up at the top. So I'm saying why can't -- it's a 
false choice
 to say keep them or scrap them. It's a better choice to say let's design a tax plan for 
2010
 that confronts the problems of 
2010
.
"
257,"
MR. GREGORY:

Anita
, your point here?
"
258,"
MS. DUNN:
I think that's a good point. I mean, the reality is the reason that, that they expire this year is because the 
Republican Congress
 didn't want to say how they were going to pay for them in the out years, which is the 
problem
 that they will have today. The, you know, if you look at what the, if you look at what the 
Republicans
 have been saying between their proposal to extend an additional 
tax cut
 to the 
wealthiest people
 in the 
country
, which is $700 billion, and getting rid of the $500 billion of savings in 
Medicare Advantage
, the first two things they could do is increase the deficit by $1.2 
trillion
, $1.3 
trillion
, again. 
David
, you know, the 
Republicans
 have said they want to -- spending cuts. They won't tell you what they're going to cut. They've said that we, and Senator 
DeMint
 this morning said, we have to fix 
Social Security
 and 
Medicare
. But apparently that doesn't involve making any tough 
choices
. Now that they 
control
 the 
House of Representatives
, they can't just say, ""We're going to cut spending. They actually have to propose cuts in spending.""
"
259,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, I'm going to take...
"
260,"
AMB. HUGHES:
Yeah, I think we're reading to do that.
"
261,"
MR. GREGORY:
Hold on.
"
262,"
AMB. HUGHES:
You just heard from a governor...
"
263,"
MS. DUNN:
Well, I...
"
264,"
AMB. HUGHES:
...a great Republican governor who is doing exactly that in his 
state
.
"
265,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.

266,"
MS. DUNN:
Well, we 
haven
't heard from anybody in the 
U.S. Senate
 or the 
House
 yet, you 
haven
't heard what they'll cut, 
Karen

AMB. HUGHES:
We'll be, we'll be seeing a lot of votes on that.
"
272,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right, we will 
stay tuned
. I'm going to take a quick break here, and we're going to come back with just a couple of moments left, talk about the legacy of 
George W. Bush
. He's speaking to 
Matt Lauer
, his new book coming out. We'll talk about that and get some final thoughts from our 
roundtable
, right after this.
"
273,"

"
274,"
MR. GREGORY:
Final moments with our 
roundtable
. George W. Books -- 
Bush
's new book, ""Decision Points,"" is about to be released, his memoir. He sat down with 
NBC
's 
Matt Lauer
, an interview that will air tomorrow night. And 
Matt
 asks him in part why he writes this book. Does he want to try to cement perceptions about his presidency or change perceptions? This is the president's answer.
"
275,"

"
276,"
PRES. GEORGE W. BUSH:
Well, I, kind of. But the main purpose of the book is to have a starting point, or not a starting point, just a data point for future historians. Because I, you got -- this may seem strange to you, I really don't care about perceptions at this point in time. I, I served. I gave it my all, and I'm a content man. And the book has been a part of the transition process to 
private life
, and it's a way for me to put the reader in the environment in which I had to make decisions.
"
277,"

"
278,"
MR. GREGORY:

Karen Hughes
, you were there the whole time. Is this an attempt to rehabilitate the 
Bush presidency
?
"
279,"
AMB. HUGHES:
I think it's a very candid and fascinating and good read account of the decisions, the major decisions that, that 
President Bush
 made in office -- the way he saw them, the kind of information he got, the kind of debate that took place, and the things he got right as well as the things he got wrong. And it's a very candid accounting of that. He says in a number of places, ""I got this wrong. I should have done this differently."" He talks about the things that he got right. He talks about the principles that he used to make decisions. And so I think people are really going to enjoy it. On every page, I see the 
person
 that I know and that, that you covered in the campaign,

MS. DUNN:
About 
President Bush

"
284,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah.
"
285,"
MS. DUNN:
I think views always change about presidents the farther you get away from the presidency, and that the good things that happen tend to come into greater prominence, and that some of the emotions around presidencies fade.

MR. GREGORY:
Final thoughts, 
10 seconds
.
"
287,"
MR. MURPHY:
I think presidents should be able to litigate from inside what happened. It's the most important point of view. People ought to read it and learn, and I think history will be very good to

302,"MR. GREGORY:  On jobs, taxes, spending, health care, and the debt, what's next?  And can the GOP stand united with the tea party's growing influence? My exclusive guests this morning, Washington's leader of the tea party, Republican senator from South Carolina Jim DeMint."
303,"Then, he was a hot commodity among Republican candidates on the campaign trail and is being called the darling of the GOP.  I'll go one-on-one with New Jersey's outspoken governor, Chris Christie."
304,"Finally, our political roundtable weighs in on the road ahead for President Obama after what he called a ""shellacking"" on Election Day."
305,(Videotape)
306,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  Sometimes we lose track of, of, you know, the, the ways that we connected with folks that got us here in the first place."
307,(End videotape)
308,"MR. GREGORY:  With us, the president's former communications adviser, Anita Dunn; counselor to President Bush, Karen Hughes; president of the National Urban League, Marc Morial; and Republican strategist and adviser to Republican candidate for governor of California Meg Whitman, Mike Murphy."
309,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
310,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
311,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  The president is on day two of his 10-day trip to Asia. But back at home, the fallout from Tuesday's big election continues.  And the big question now, how will the Republicans use the new power they have? Joining me from his home state of South Carolina this morning, the Washington leader of the tea party, Republican Senator Jim DeMint."
312,"Senator, welcome to MEET THE PRESS."
313,"SEN. JIM DeMINT (R-SC):  Thank you, David.  And I can't claim to be the leader of the tea party, but I'm sure glad they raised the interest level of the American voter this year.  It made a real difference in the election."
314,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, well, let me ask you that, plain and simple.  Is the tea party now running the Republican Party?"
315,"SEN. DeMINT:  Hardly.  I'm hoping the Republican Party will embrace a lot of the ideas of the tea party, but it's a mistake to think that the tea party is one big organization.  It's made of up thousands of leaders all across the country of, of citizens who are just tired of out-of-control
spending.  They want to take back the power from the Washington politicians.  And I think they made a huge difference in the election. But they're just a part of this awakening of the American people, this citizen activism, I think, that's realigning politics in America today."
316,"MR. GREGORY:  What about the election results on Tuesday?  In your judgment, was that step one in making President Obama a one-term president?"
317,"SEN. DeMINT:  Well, I don't know that that's the issue.  I think people are rejecting in large numbers this rampage of government spending and takeover that the, the president has been leading.  But also even before Obama was president, Pelosi and Reid have been in charge of the Congress now for four years.  They've had plenty of time to show what they're going to do.  Pelosi said there would not be anymore deficit spending; we've had $5 trillion in deficit since then.  So I think this is a rejection of Obama's policy.  But this is not about whether or not he's a one- or two-term president.  This is about turning our country away from
a fiscal cliff.  We're in trouble, and we don't have time to play politics anymore.  We have got to look at the federal government, determine what it absolutely has to do, and then see if we can devolve power and spending back to the states."
318,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, and I, I want to ask you about some specific areas of--issue areas of the agenda.  Before I do that, another question about the tea party.  You were active in supporting tea party candidates around the country.  You had some, some big winners around the country that you campaigned for.  There are some of them.  But you also had some notable losses, particularly in the Senate, and I want to single one out.  You were behind Christine O'Donnell, who lost, of course, in Delaware.  And here was the front page of the Wilmington News Journal on Wednesday after the election. The banner headline, ""No taste for tea."" And frankly, there's been some backlash about your support for her.  Politico reported
it this way this week: ""A bloc of prominent senators and operatives said party purists like Palin and Senator DeMint had foolishly pushed nominees too conservative to win in politically competitive states.  ..."
319,"`If you think what happened in Delaware is ""a win"" for the Republican Party then we don't have a snowball's chance to win the White House,'"" that's Senator Lindsey Graham, also from South Carolina.  ""`If you think Delaware was a wake-up call for Republicans then we have a shot at doing well for a long time.'"" Do you think the tea party actually cost the Republican Party control of the Senate?"
320,"SEN. DeMINT:  That is a very silly thing to say, David.  The tea party are responsible for just about every Republican who was elected around the country.  This time last year, if people'll think about it, we were concerned about holding our own.  Many thought Republicans would fall
below 38 in, in the Senate.  So I supported all the Republican candidates, including Christine O'Donnell.  Unfortunately, she was so maligned by Republicans, I don't think she ever had a chance.  But we had historic gains in the Senate and in the House, so..."
321,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator, you're not really saying that it was just lack of Republican support that tanked her candidacy, are you?  This is a woman who said on national--in an ad that she was not a witch."
322,"SEN. DeMINT:  Well, I think we did see in the, in the wake of her primary win, a number of Republicans suggest she was not a viable candidate. That, that did make it difficult for her to start on the right foot.  But all over the country we saw candidates like Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, Marco Rubio in Florida, Rand Paul in Kentucky, we saw candidates that
were supported by a tea party in, in a new active wave of, of citizens change the face of the Senate. This is what Republicans have needed for a long time, a new, young Republicans, Cuban-American senator.  We've got African-American congressmen. This is a huge change for the Republican Party, and I think it's going to be very positive for our country."
323,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  So, Senator, let me go down the list of important issues that I know you care about, and let's try to do this in, in--a little bit more quickly than we might normally get some answers for you.  On health care, how do you go about dismantling it?"
324,"SEN. DeMINT:  Well, first of all we have to stop the funding of Obamacare and over the next two years show the American people what the real options are to improve the system we have now.  I don't think Americans want to throw out our current system, they want to improve it.  And there are a lot of ways we can make insurance more available, more affordable, available to those with pre-existing conditions.  And we need to let the American people know that there are ways to do this without moving to the government-control system. The first step is obviously to, to defund it, and I think we can do that with Republicans controlling the House."
325,MR. GREGORY:  But do you think repeal is realistic?
326,"SEN. DeMINT:  Yes, I do.  I think the next Republican running for president needs to run on complete repeal of Obamacare because we really can't tweak it, David.  It's built on a platform of government control, and that doesn't really work in America.  We need a, a patient-physician system that's based more on competition and free markets.  We really can't do that under this system that's so heavily prescribed in, in Obamacare."
327,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, you're talking about the president in 2012, running for president.  You don't really think that you can overcome a presidential veto of repealing health care in the Senate, do you?"
328,"SEN. DeMINT:  Well, not before 2012.  But we can certainly defund it. Most, most aspects of this new Obamacare are not implemented for two more years, so it's very realistic to think we can slow the implementation of it or delay it, and then replace it in 2012 with, with a real plan to improve health care in America."
329,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, let me move to a few others.  The cultural litmus test for Republicans, I've been told, the earmark issue.  This is pork barrel spending as part of the budget process.  You want them done away with, as do other tea party lawmakers and other Republicans.  But
Mitch McConnell, of ourse, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate, was asked about it the other day, and this is what he said."
330,"(Videotape, Thursday)"
331,"SEN. MITCH McCONNELL (R-KY):  As I think all of you know, you could eliminate every congressional earmark and it would save no money.  It's really an argument about discretion."
332,(End videotape)
333,MR. GREGORY:  Doesn't sound like he's with you all the way.  Is this a showdown coming for Republicans?
334,"SEN. DeMINT:  Well, it, it may be.  But I think the message is clear from the American people, and I know there's some senior members in Congress who think it's their job to take home bacon.  But the real reason for the dysfunction of Congress right now is you have over 500 congressmen and senators who think they're there to bring home the bacon.  It's kind of,
""To heck with America, just give me the money."" We can't do that anymore. Parochial politics needs to be out in Washington."
335,MR. GREGORY:  But what about Leader McConnell?  He is not with you.
336,SEN. DeMINT:  We need to focus on...
337,"MR. GREGORY:  He is suggesting that it's more a question of discretion. This is a leader of the Republicans.  Are you prepared to go toe-to-toe with him, and is this going to be a big showdown with your Republican leadership?"
338,"SEN. DeMINT:  I don't think so.  Mitch McConnell has voted twice for an earmark ban that I've proposed in the Senate.  Just about every Republican who is running for the Senate this time ran on a no earmark pledge.  And we've had a vote where over half of our conference has voted for the ban before. Obviously, I'm hopeful I will have leadership support.  But we've got a number of co-sponsors.  Tom Coburn and I are leading the effort for this earmark ban, and, and we know John Boehner has committed to it in the House.  We're not going to have earmarks.  So it's, it's really silly for some senior Republicans in the Senate to try to block it."
339,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Let me ask you about another hot button issue, and that is the debt ceiling.  Come spring, Congress is going to have to vote to raise the debt ceiling because our debt is increasing and it's reaching the $4.3 trillion limit that Congress has already set--$14.3
trillion limit that Congress set in February.  Will you vote to increase the debt ceiling?"
340,"SEN. DeMINT:  No, I won't, not, not unless this debt ceiling is combined with some path to balancing our budget, returning to 2008 spending levels, repealing Obamacare.  We have got to demonstrate that we have the resolve to cut spending.  Now, we've already spent the money, and raising the debt ceiling is just like paying off your credit card bill; but we cannot allow that to go through the Congress without showing the American people that we are going to balance the budget and we're not going to continue to raise the debt in America."
341,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Well, let me ask you specifically about that. Where would--do you think the American people have to be prepared for sacrifice?  Which part of the budget, knowing that there's only 15 percent that's nondiscretionery, or that's real--nondefense discretionary part of the budget, what are you going to target for cuts?"
342,"SEN. DeMINT:  Well, I don't think the American people are going to have to sacrifice as much as the government bureaucrats who get paid about twice what the American worker does.  First of all, we just need to return to pre-Obama levels of spending in 2008.  We need to cut earmarks so people will quit focusing on taking home the bacon.  We need to defund Obamacare, and then we need to look at the entitlement programs, such as the way Paul Ryan has done in the House with his road maps to America's future, to fix our tax code, to fix Social Security and Medicare, and to cut the cost over time.  We've got the plans, David, to do this, we just--we need to talk about them, we need to help the American people see
where we're going..."
343,MR. GREGORY:  But let me just...
344,SEN. DeMINT:  ...but we can cut spending.
345,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me just stop you.  I want to be very, very, very specific because going back to 2008 spending levels will not get anywhere close to balancing the budget.  So you're saying that everything has to be on the table--cuts in defense, cuts in Medicare, cuts in Social Security.  Is that right?"
346,"SEN. DeMINT:  Well, no, we're not talking about cuts in Social Security. If we can just cut the administrative waste, we can cut hundreds of billions of dollars a year at the federal level.  So before we start cutting--I mean, we need to keep our promises to seniors, David, and
cutting benefits to seniors is not on the table.  Excuse me, let me grab a sip of water."
347,"MR. GREGORY:  But then, but where, but where do you make the cuts?  I mean, if you're protecting everything for those, the most potent political groups like seniors who go out and vote, where are you really going to balance the budget?"
348,"SEN. DeMINT:  Well, look at Paul Ryan's Roadmap to the Future.  We see a clear path to moving back to a balanced budget over time.  Again, the plans are on the table.  We don't have to cut benefits for seniors, and we don't need to cut Medicare like, like the Democrats did in this big Obamacare bill. We can restore sanity in Washington without cutting any
benefits to seniors or veterans."
349,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you a final question about 2012.  Who's got the inside track for president, and do you think tea party forces--yourself, Sarah Palin--have an inside track moving forward?"
350,"SEN. DeMINT:  Well, I think the, the, the voters have the inside track here. I think the citizen activism is going to change politics.  I think Sarah Palin did an incredible amount of good to raise the interest level of what's going on in politics, so she did a lot for the Republican
Party, Michele Bachmann, others.  But we've got a, I think, a great list of folks, including the next person who'll be on your show, Chris Christie, who's demonstrated a lot of courage.  And probably more than anything else right now, David, we need politicians with the courage to
make very difficult decisions, to fight special interest groups, and that's what I want to see in the next Republican nominee."
351,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Senator DeMint, thank you very much for joining us this morning."
352,"SEN. DeMINT:  Thank you, David."
353,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We now turn to the aforementioned Republican who has emerged as a leader of his party, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie."
354,Welcome to the program.
355,"GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ):  Thank you, David."
356,MR. GREGORY:  Good to have you here.
357,GOV. CHRISTIE:  Happy to be here.
358,"MR. GREGORY:  When you talk about the response from the voters on Election Day, something's very curious.  We know some of the feelings about the Democrats, about President Obama's policies, but look at this from the exit polls in terms of the opinion of political parties.
Republicans didn't fare too well either; 52 percent unfavorable rating. What does that say about the Republican Party today?"
359,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  You know, I think what it says is what I was saying all over the country, that's it's put up or shut up time for our party.  You know, we lost our way last decade, David, we did, and people expect us to do better. And if the Republican Party wants to come back, they're going to have to do what they said they were going to do.  I mean, because if
they don't, we're going to be sent to the wilderness for a long time, and we're going to deserve it."
360,MR. GREGORY:  What does that mean?  What do they have to put up?
361,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  What they have to do is they say they want, and, and we're doing it in New Jersey:  smaller government, less spending, less regulation, lower taxes.  That's what the public is saying that they want.  And if you look at what we've done in New Jersey, David, we're delivering on that.  We're not fixed yet, but we're on the track to being fixed, closing an $11 billion budget deficit without any new or increased taxes, cutting the corporate business tax.  We're doing things to try to create an environment where private sector jobs can grow."
362,"MR. GREGORY:  And, and I want to talk about some of the choices you made in New Jersey.  But, you know, you heard Senator DeMint, and there's a lot of Republicans talking about cutting the deficit, cutting the budget, but they're not specific.  He wasn't specific.  He talks about Paul Ryan, who has some ideas about Medicare and changing the way that's structured,
indeed, making some cuts.  Paul Ryan in the House, he's from Wisconsin, doesn't have support among establishment Republicans.  There are 15 Republicans who stood up behind him in terms of making these cuts.  Are Republicans really making good when Senator DeMint and others  aren't specific about the cuts they're going to make to entitlements or to defense, to the big ticket items that really move the budget?"
363,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Well, let me tell you what's--where the leadership's going to come from.  You have 11 Republican governors and a Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo in New York, who have said we can't raise taxes and we have to cut spending in everything.  In New Jersey what we did was we cut spending in every department, a 9 percent cut in real spending,
not projected spending, real spending year over year.  Find another state that did that and, and we'll go and talk about it.  I mean, we made real hard decisions, and I cut some programs that we would've liked to have kept."
364,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
365,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  But we're broke.  We don't have the money anymore.  And so I hope that what these governors, Republicans and Democrats, will show Washington is you can do this and you have to do it."
366,"MR. GREGORY:  I asked Senator DeMint about sacrifice, and he said, `Oh, we don't want to, we don't want to break our promise to our seniors.  In your state, what are you telling people they have to sacrifice and what do Republicans around the country have to tell Americans they have to sacrifice if they want to bring the size of government under control and the deficit under control?"
367,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  We told everybody there has to be shared sacrifice among everyone, and let me be specific.  We cut every department of state government.  We cut funding to K to 12 education.  We are proposed real pension and benefit reforms on public sector workers, increasing the retirement age, eliminating COLAs, things that are really going to bring the pension problem back under control.  We cut all of this spending in the state in every state department, David, every state department.  From environmental protection, to military and veterans affairs, all the way through had to sustain a cut.  Those are the type of things you have to do to show people you really mean shared sacrifice.  Everyone came to the table and everybody had to contribute."
368,"MR. GREGORY:  So, as you, as a national Republican with national influence now--and you've met with congressional Republicans and talked about issues--does everything have to be on the table?"
369,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  What I told them was they'd better come up with a plan that's credible like we did in New Jersey, and the public's going to be able to smell real quickly if you're not credible.  And if we are not credible, then we are really going to be in trouble as a party, and I
think the numbers you showed indicate that."
370,"MR. GREGORY:  What about the tea party, the tea party's influence on the Republican party?  Net positive, net negative?  What do you think?"
371,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Net positive.  Listen, the core that drives the tea party, in my view, are those four principles I talked about before--less spending, smaller government and less intrusive government, lower regulation, and lower taxes.  And when Republicans are at their best, those are our core principles. And so I think that, at bottom, it's a positive influence.  Listen, you're going to have variances around, around the country.  I endorsed Mike Castle in the primary..."
372,"MR. GREGORY:  Right, in Delaware."
373,GOV. CHRISTIE:  Yes.
374,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
375,GOV. CHRISTIE:  Because I felt he was the best person.
376,"MR. GREGORY:  Is that a wake--do you agree with Lindsey Graham from South Carolina or Jim DeMint from South Carolina, that Delaware is a wake-up call for Republicans?"
377,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  I think Delaware was a missed opportunity to have a really good United States senator in Mike Castle, and that's why I endorsed him in the primary."
378,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me talk a little bit more about New Jersey and taxes and spending.  And I want to talk specifically about the--this ARC tunnel, this rail tunnel that would've connected New York and New Jersey and the controversy surrounding this.  To boil all of this down, the
federal government, as I understand it, offered you a deal.  You were worried about cost, cost overruns, and they said, ""Look, we're going to take care of that. New Jersey's not going to be responsible."" So critics have used..."
379,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Well, let me stop you right there."
380,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
381,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  No chance.  That never happened.  The federal government said $3 billion is what they were going to give us, and I had to sign a contract saying every nickel over $3 billion was the responsibility of the federal government.  All the federal government offered me in the interim two week period, between the time when I first canceled the tunnel, was the ability to get federal loans..."
382,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
383,GOV. CHRISTIE:  ...that we'd have to pay back.
384,MR. GREGORY:  They weren't going to shift this to...
385,GOV. CHRISTIE:  No.
386,MR. GREGORY:  ...private companies to be able to take care of it?
387,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  No.  It was federal loans or, if we wanted a public-private partnership, we had to have increased fees on all the train tickets, for all the commuters, all across New Jersey, including ones that weren't using the tunnel, to be able to repay it.  No matter what, David, this was going to fall on the people of the state of New Jersey, and the worst part was, it was a blank check.  No one could tell me how much this was going to cost.  We had already put $5.7 billion up from the state of New Jersey, and we were talking about $2 billion to $5
billion in overruns now.  I mean, we could not sustain that.  We're broke."
388,"MR. GREGORY:  Is this a matter of ideology for you, or simply a pragmatic issue that you don't have the money?  And by that I mean, should the federal government be involved in big infrastructure projects like this?"
389,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Sure, they should.  And you know what?  I gave the federal government two weeks to come back to me and say if this is a project of such national importance, then put more money on the table for it.  But, you know, they didn't.  In, in Florida, where they're building high speed rail, Florida's being asked to give a 20 percent match to an 80 percent for federal. In this project, New Jersey was picking up 70 percent of the cost, the feds 30 percent and nothing from the state or the city of New York.  Listen, this is about fairness and about what we could afford, and I'm not going to sign blank checks on the taxpayers in the state of New Jersey for a project that, as laudable as it might be in some respects, we simply can't afford now.  When we talked to the campaign, David, about tough choices, this is an example."
390,"MR. GREGORY:  Tax cuts.  You've got a millionaires tax in New Jersey, which I know that you're opposed to."
391,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Not anymore, we don't."
392,MR. GREGORY:  Not anymore because...
393,GOV. CHRISTIE:  No.
394,MR. GREGORY:  ...you vetoed it.
395,GOV. CHRISTIE:  Yes.
396,MR. GREGORY:  You've got high taxes across the board.
397,GOV. CHRISTIE:  We do.
398,MR. GREGORY:  How do you deal with that as a Republican governor of New Jersey?
399,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Well, first you say, ""No more."" And the Democrats sent me an extension of the millionaires tax that would have not only hit individuals but small business in New Jersey, and I vetoed it.  And I'm not going to increase taxes on the state that the Tax Foundation has said is the highest burdened tax state in America, especially if you look at our unemployment rate, David, ours is higher than any state in our region.  The reason is, over the last eight years under Corzine and McGreevey, we raised taxes and fees 115 times. We put a wet blanket on the economy of New Jersey, and that's why our people are still out of work is proportionately to everybody else in the region.  New York is a point lower.  Pennsylvania is more than a point lower.  I mean, we, you know, we did this to ourselves with all these increased taxes."
400,"MR. GREGORY:  What about the Bush tax cuts and extending those?  You've said that should happen at all levels for a couple of years, but you've said only a couple of years because there is a day of reckoning here. Can you have tax cuts when you also want to balance the, the budget?  Or do you have to consider tax increases at the federal level at some point?"
401,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Well, you know, I've been watching you for weeks talk about extending the Bush tax cuts.  Drives me crazy when I'm sitting at home.  This is about maintaining the current tax structure in a time we have a very weak economy.  And so I favor extending these for another two years, extending the current tax system and not having a tax increase."
402,"MR. GREGORY:  But those, I mean, wait a minute.  It may drive you crazy, and I know other Republicans that feel the same way.  But I've also talked to Republicans.  I've talked to economists like Alan Greenspan who say there is no free lunch here.  You cannot have tax cuts at this level and not have them be paid for.  And other Republicans say, yes, they should be paid for.  So you do agree they should be paid for."
403,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Well, obviously--well, listen, I've, I'm walking the walk in New Jersey, David."
404,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
405,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  I mean, when I said we're vetoing the millionaires tax, I found spending tax to pay for that."
406,"MR. GREGORY:  So you can have existing tax policy, but it still has to be offset."
407,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Well, listen, and I'm not disagreeing with you, David."
408,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
409,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  But I'm--what I'm disagreeing with you is you characterizing what's happening here as a--as tax cuts.  This is maintaining the current tax policy in a weak economy, and what you're, what you're advocating through your question is tax increases."
410,"MR. GREGORY: I'm not--that's not fair.  I'm not advocating. I'm, I'm questioning whether or not they have to be paid for."
411,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Well, when you call the, when you call the tax cuts, what I'm saying is the--I take the position as the opposite of that."
412,MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Right.
413,GOV. CHRISTIE:  The opposite of that is it is a tax increase in a weakened...
414,MR. GREGORY:  But they are set to expire.
415,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  ...weaks in, in a weakened economy.  And what I'm saying is you should keep the current tax structure in place until our economy gets stronger."
416,"MR. GREGORY:  That's fine.  But they're set to expire, so if you're going to re-authorize them, they're, they're, you're voting for tax cuts. "
417,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  No, you're not voting for tax cuts.  You're voting to maintain the current tax structure."
418,"MR. GREGORY:  I understand, a continuation."
419,GOV. CHRISTIE:  That's a...
420,MR. GREGORY:  But there's...
421,GOV. CHRISTIE:  And then we agree.
422,MR. GREGORY:  And there's still an offset issue.
423,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Well, then we agree."
424,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
425,"The, the issue of where there's room for negotiation, is there room for negotiation in your mind?  Should the president make a deal here on, on these things for a certain period of time?  Does everybody, then, in a couple of years have to come to this and say, ""Maybe these aren't the best ideas.  Maybe we also have to think about tax increases at some point""?"
426,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Well, I think the first thing that the president has to focus on is building private sector jobs again in this country.  And I don't think, by increasing taxes, that's the way to--that we're going to get it done in the short term.  And so, sure, there's areas for 
compromise, I'm sure there are, between Republican leaders in the Congress and the president.  But the president has to lead on this.  And I think that the message is really clear, I got the message from the election, it's about putting people back to work. And you will not put
people back to work in private sector jobs by increasing the cost in the private sector."
427,"MR. GREGORY:  A couple more areas.  I want to--you've become an YouTube star, as you well know, because you've had some, some interactions with voters, including when you were campaigning for Meg Whitman out in California.  Let me show that moment."
428,"(Videotape, September 22, 2010)"
429,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  You know what, you want to yell, yell at me, but don't give her a hard time.  We're here.  We're here talking about the future of the state of California and the future of our country.  And you know what?"
430,Unidentified Man:  And you're just talking about the truth that's she's lying about.
431,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  And you know what?  And you know what?  Let me tell you, and let me tell you this.  You know what?  It's people who raise their voices and yell and scream like you that are dividing this country. We're here to bring this country together, not to divide it."
432,(End videotape)
433,"MR. GREGORY:  So what's the balance?  On to a style question.  The balance for you being a straight talker, you know, taking on the corrosive conversations we have about politics, and then your image as being a little too brusque, bullying, you know, Governor Wrecking Ball?
How do you, how do you straddle that line?"
434,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Well, I am who I am.  I don't straddle the line.  And I think what people in New Jersey appreciate about, appreciate about me is I don't send smoke signals.  They know who I am.  They know how I feel about issues. Sometimes they agree with and sometimes they don't, but all I think that that clip indicates is that when I have something on my mind, I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it directly.  And I think that we have too little of that in politics, David.  And when, when I sit around and watch the way some people in political life talk, it, it fogs me over.  And I think it fogs people in America over too.  They want to
hear somebody say, ""If you feel a certain way, say it and live with the consequences."" I'm willing to let the chips fall where they may on that issue."
435,MR. GREGORY:  So the question is whether you're going to say all this stuff at a national level.
436,"You've ruled out running for president in 2012.  But you're also acting like a guy who's increasing your national influence.  You're campaigning for congressional Republicans.  Why do all of that?  Why, especially in tight races, if you're not looking down the line at running?"
437,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Because I care about my country. And because I felt that those people where the absolute best candidates to help make our country a better place.  And so that's why I campaigned for them.  I have no other agenda.  And to the extent that New Jersey over the last year can serve as an example to people that say, ""Listen, you can cut spending.
You can balance a budget without tax increases.  You can make hard choices and not only survive politically but thrive politically."" Then I want to try to set that example for folks so that these other new governors who are coming in, members of Congress..."
438,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
439,GOV. CHRISTIE:  ...that they will act boldly and be strong.
440,"MR. GREGORY:  Shermanesque statement, you're not running in 2012?"
441,GOV. CHRISTIE:  Absolutely.
442,MR. GREGORY:  You wouldn't be on a ticket at all as VP?
443,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Can you see me as somebody's vice president, David, after, after that question about governor wrecking ball?  I would feel bad for that poor man or woman."
444,"MR. GREGORY:  What about down the line, beyond 2012?  What, what criteria would you use in making a decision about whether to run for president?"
445,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Well, first I have to decide whether I run for re-election in 2013 in New Jersey, and that's going to be determined by how good a job I do and whether the people in the state of New Jersey want me back.  So before you ever get to anything beyond that, you know, my mother always taught me first things first.  Do your job.  Do your job that the people of New Jersey gave you.  I love being governor and I'm got to be governor until 2013, then we'll see what the verdict of the people is of the job I did on 2013."
446,MR. GREGORY:  So fair at least to say the door is open beyond 2012.
447,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  I'm going to need a job, David, after 2013, you know? And so whether it's going to be being governor of New Jersey or doing something else, I have four kids between 7 and 17, I'm working the rest of my life anyway.  So it's going to be doing something, David, so maybe it'll be that.  Who knows."
448,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor Christie, thank you very much."
449,"GOV. CHRISTIE:  Thank you, David."
450,MR. GREGORY:  Appreciate it.
451,"Coming next, the road ahead for President Obama after what he deemed a ""shellacking"" on Election Day, and a look down the road to 2012.  Our roundtable weighs in:  the president's former communication adviser Anita Dunn; former counselor to President Bush, Karen Hughes; president of the National Urban League, Marc Morial; and Republican strategist Mike
Murphy. Only here on MEET THE PRESS."
452,(Announcements)
453,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up, our political roundtable weighs in on the road ahead for President Obama after what he called a ""shellacking"" on Election Day, after this brief commercial break."
454,(Announcements)
455,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We are back.  We are--and they're already talking, our political roundtable, to break down what happened on Tuesday and where we go from here.  Joining me now, president of the National Urban League, Marc Morial; Republican strategist and adviser to Meg Whitman's gubernatorial campaign in California--we'll talk about that--Mike Murphy; counselor to President Bush, Karen Hughes; and President Obama's former communications adviser, Anita Dunn."
456,Welcome to all of you.
457,"MR. MARC MORIAL:  Thanks, David."
458,MS. ANITA DUNN:  Good morning.
459,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, I, I want to start.  I mean, what a, what a week and what an Election Day.  But I want to talk specifically about President Obama's reaction to all of this.  And it was striking to me, Anita Dunn, as you worked in the White House, that the president appeared to be struggling in that press conference, sort of working through the fact that he's struggling to connect to the American people two years after such an important victory.  He talked about some leadership failures. He's appearing on ""60 Minutes"" tonight, and this is what--part of what he told Steve Kroft."
460,(Videotape)
461,"PRES. OBAMA:  I think it's a fair argument.  I--you know, I think that, over the course of two years, we were so busy and so focused on getting a bunch of stuff done that we stopped paying attention to the fact that, you know, leadership isn't just legislation, that it's a matter of persuading people and giving them confidence and bringing them together, making an argument that people can understand.  And I think that we haven't always been successful at that, and I take personal responsibility for that."
462,(End videotape)
463,"MR. GREGORY:  You know, my colleague Savannah Guthrie, covering the White House, I thought asked the most important question:  Does the president get it?"
464,"MS. DUNN:  Well, listen, I think that what President Obama said is, is absolutely correct, which is he came into office facing great policy challenges, and with those policy challenges came great communications challenges.  And I think many people say, you know, in terms of the
policy, in terms of the immediate crisis, in terms of keeping this country from sliding into a depression that, you know, this administration's done a very good job. In terms of kind of outlining to a very, to a very worried, frustrated and increasingly angry American
people what comes next and where's that better place--and I was part of that communications operation--you know, obviously that's a challenge that we didn't quite get to as we did for the policy one."
465,"But here's, here's the reality, David, which is for two years with Democrats controlling everything, it was kind of Democrats against Democrats and a referendum, there's now going to be a very clear choice in this town, and I think that the communications challenge..."
466,"MR. GREGORY:  But we're not--but, Anita, we're not there yet."
467,"MS. DUNN:  No, but it actually gets a little easier here, so--uh-huh."
468,"MR. GREGORY:  But I'm still grappling with--yeah.  But, but, but, Karen, I mean, there, there was--I detected a certain level of impatience and irritation, even, on the president's part that Americans don't seem to get what's been done for them."
469,"AMB. KAREN HUGHES:  He was very uncomfortable.  And sometimes, David, you have a communications problem, and sometimes you just have a problem. This was a massive repudiation of the president's policies.  And frankly, it's a little insulting for him to suggest he  wasn't able to persuade us, as if we're so stupid that we just don't get how brilliant his policies
were.  No, we don't like his policies.  We don't like the trillion-dollar stimulus and the trillion-dollar massive health care at a time of enormous anxiety.  We need to--and, and the proof to me, David, that he really wasn't getting the message was when he talked about tweaking.
This was not a tweak election, this was a ""Turn this baby around, we are on the wrong course""..."
470,"MR. GREGORY:  Marc Morial, what do you say?"
471,"MR. MORIAL:  It was not a ""turn this baby around election"" because when you look at the exit polls, the exit poll said something different.  They showed a sharply divided nation on issues like health care.  They showed a sharply divided nation.  The wrong thing to do with this election is to overstate the results.  You--and there was a mistake in 2008 to overstate
the results, and I think it's a mistake in 2010 to overstate the results. The fact of the matter is.  it was a repudiation of the Democratic and the Republican Parties if you look at favorability ratings coming out of the exit polls."
472,"MR. GREGORY:  Right, we showed that."
473,"MR. MORIAL:  And you saw a sharply divided country about the issue of health care.  I think the president gets it.  Every great champion, every great president at some point gets pushed to the ropes, may get knocked down to a knee.  President Obama will get up, he will fight back, he will stand on his principles.  It was a tough week.  Anyone who's been through
a tough political loss knows the feeling in your gut, the re-examination you go through, and I think he's going through that.  But I think it's wrong to look at it as some sort of mandate.  And we want to do that, claim a great victory when in fact the nation is..."
474,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Well, but here, here's my question, Mike Murphy. We know that Americans voted their economic anxiety."
475,MR. MIKE MURPHY:  Mm-hmm.
476,"MR. GREGORY:  But they also did make a statement about their desire or lack thereof of the role of government in our lives, particularly in an..."
477,MR. MURPHY:  Mm-hmm.
478,"MR. GREGORY:  ...this, this period of economic upheaval.  And it seems to me the president struggled all throughout these first two years making the argument and winning the argument that government was part of the answer, part of the solution, not part of the problem."
479,"MR. MURPHY:  Yeah, we just had a referendum on that--excuse me--and the president lost, and he lost by historic proportions.  So I think he knows he got shellacked, the problem is publicly what to say about it, because when your ideological point of view is totally repudiated, it's kind of hard to have much to say.  So what the president has to do now is reset the clock and get a forward-going message because there's no backward-going message that's going to help him at all.  And I think he's got two choices, either hunker down and kind of have a passive plan and hope the Republicans repeat the mistakes of 1994 and act like they've
just won control of the government, which I don't--I think we've learned from that mistake and we won't do it again; or he's got to make a big move where he grabs the agenda again and makes tremendously painful for him but politically effective and I would think economically effective policy compromises.  That's the choice."
480,"AMB. HUGHES:  But the irony is, but the irony is that a president who really owes much of his presidency to the power of his words--and I was among those who was inspired by his words in 2008 even though I disagree with his policies--those words have lost their power because he's used them so carelessly.  For example, calling for civility the day after the election, an election in which he called his opponents enemies and told Republicans we had to sit in the backseat of the car.  I think he's, he's carelessly used words. He, he gratuitously took a lot of political shots in this election, and so his calls for civility, his calls for--his,
his--he's lost the power of his words, and that, that makes it very hard for him to set an agenda."
481,MR. MURPHY:  Yeah...
482,"MS. DUNN:  David, I, I, I--yeah, but I, I want to talk about words for a second because on Tuesday night we saw the Republican leadership saying that they were humbled, they understood there wasn't a mandate, and since then all they've done is claim a mandate for policies that, frankly, weren't borne out by the people who showed up and by the exit polls
you've cited.  For instance, as Marc pointed out, even with this very conservative electorate that showed up to vote on Tuesday night, support for either repealing or keeping the healthcare program is split 47-48. There is not a mandate for rolling it back.  Fifty-two percent of those voters felt that some or all of those Bush tax cuts should not be renewed.  And, and so I say to myself, you know, the Republicans are now trying to create a mandate where none exists, and the reality is that the vote was very much a rejection of the status quo.  I mean, the status quo's been on the ballot for three times now, and it loses every time."
483,"MR. MURPHY:  But, but if the Democrats want to litigate exit polls and put Speaker Pelosi back in the front window, it is the biggest gift to the Republican Party since the elephant.  What the, the president's either going to do is he--we're all going to sit here in pundit land and
chew him to pieces if he wants to talk about how he lost the election, because he's not particularly good at humility and contrition.  That is not his core skill. He's got to decide to finally, what he hasn't done for two years, is get big, be the biggest guy in politics, not be passive to the Democrats in Congress--who, by the way, have gone even farther left with these election results--and grab the whole thing, or he's going to be diminished and do very, very badly."
484,"MR. MORIAL:  Well, you know, I think the other thing, too, is I don't know if there's an appetite to relitigate things like health care. Because if you look at the, the exit polling, there's a split.  And the question is, as I looked at Jim DeMint, is it seemed to be--he seemed to be suggesting that there is ""another plan."" I'd like to ""see that plan."""
485,"MR. GREGORY:  There's no plan.  He made it very clear, the plan is to run on this in 2012.  They don't--the Republicans don't have support to get rid of health care now."
486,"MR. MORIAL:  It's--what it is, is it's a political plan."
487,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
488,MR. MORIAL:  It's not a plan to address the problems in our nation.
489,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but, but here's, but here's a political question. Alex Sink, she ran for governor down in Florida and lost, which the White House was not happy about--lost narrowly, by the way, to a flawed Republican candidate who put a lot of his own money in there.  She said, ""Look, the White House was tone deaf; tone deaf on response to the gulf oil spill, tone deaf on lack of acceptance to health care."" I mean, there are people, including Democrats, the way they ran, who felt that health care ultimately was a war of choice and not a war of necessity for Obama."
490,"MR. MORIAL:  And, you know, David, there, there's merit into the notion that the White House needs to make some modifications and make some changes to how they communicate and how they undertake it.  So here's my prescription.  My prescription is that they've got to focus like a laser in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night on jobs, jobs, jobs.  What I hear around the country when I travel the nation, from all sorts of groups of people, is they want a plan for jobs and economic growth.  If the leaders of both sides can come together around a plan for jobs and economic growth, I think that would be in the best interests of the nation.  If this is going to simply be a tactical discussion about what political move helps you in 2012..."
491,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
492,"MR. MORIAL:  ...both parties are risking, risking that you're going to have another volatile election."
493,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but let--I want to get, I want to get one more thing in before the break."
494,"Karen, as a, as a professional here, not just, you know, with your political leanings, President Bush in '06 takes a thumping, as he says, in the polls, fires Don Rumsfeld, and then proceeds to, to move into the surge, which Democrats didn't like.  He was at a different point at his presidency."
495,"MS. DUNN:  It was a very different point in the presidency, right."
496,"MR. GREGORY:  He could do something different here.  What is the road back for President Obama?  What's the, the line between consensus building and actually pushing the Republicans away and forcing a show down?"
497,"AMB. HUGHES:  I think the more instructive model is what Bill Clinton did after the 1994 election.  When he was two years in, he went back to the middle.  He moderated his positions and policies.  He reached out to Republicans.  There were some contentious times and--with Newt Gingrich, but he reached out to Republicans, and he came back to the center.  And
that is what the American people are fundamentally saying. You--President Obama talked a lot about the car in the ditch during this election.  Well, the voters kicked the tires and they said we're going to turn this baby around because what we got home with is not what we were
sold.  This is not--the trillion dollar stimulus, the, the massive complex healthcare plan, which, by the way, has an impact on jobs. Employers aren't hiring because they're afraid of the uncertainty of what that healthcare plan will do to their business and..."
498,"MR. MORIAL:  And health care is the only sector of the economy creating
jobs."
499,MS. DUNN:  Right.
500,MR. MURPHY:  Mm-hmm.
501,"MR. MORIAL:  I mean, that's the point about it is that the healthcare sector is, indeed, creating jobs."
502,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
503,"MS. DUNN:  But, David, you know, in--let's not forget that they weren't able to move to some kind of consensus until after the Republicans had shut down the government, that 1995 was the year in which Democrats drew a very hard line with Republican priorities.  Republicans felt they'd come in with a mandate that they actually didn't have from the voters, to come in.  And what you're seeing right now I think is Republicans coming in and there are parts of their party that are--think they actually did get sent here with a real mandate to do some things and that you don't actually get to consensus..."
504,MR. GREGORY:  Hm.
505,MS. DUNN:  ...until you've had to make those hard choices.
506,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, I'm going to take a break here."
507,MS. DUNN:  Yes.
508,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to come back, talk about the agenda ahead.  I also want to talk about the tea party's influence in that showdown that's coming up between tea partyers and the establishment Republicans.  Back more with our roundtable when we come back right after this break."
509,(Announcements)
510,"MR. GREGORY:  We are back with our roundtable.  Mike Murphy, I want to ask about the tea party, but I've got to ask you, first..."
511,MR. MURPHY:  Sure.
512,MR. GREGORY:  ...you were with Meg Whitman.
513,MR. MURPHY:  I was.
514,"MR. GREGORY:  What happened in California?  You thought this would be closer. In the end, it wasn't."
515,"MR. MURPHY:  It wasn't.  We got beat and, you know, I ran the campaign, and I take responsibility for it.  It's a very blue state and it's getting bluer. As the red, you know, wave kind of went one way, there was a bit of a blue riptide coming the other way.  We had a tough time in Washington state and Oregon and definitely in California.  And I think the other thing is that CEO candidates who are doing kind of a tough medicine message, be it, you know, Linda McMahon in Connecticut in a blue state..."
516,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
517,"MR. MURPHY:  ...Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, Meg and Carly Fiorina in California, they weren't buying it.  So we just couldn't get there.  We could win the Republicans, win the independents, but in California if you don't win a lot of Democrats..."
518,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
519,MR. MURPHY:  ...you don't win and we did not.
520,"MR. GREGORY:  $160 million, though."
521,MR. MURPHY:  Right.
522,MR. GREGORY:  It seemed to be a referendum on big money candidates coming in and swaying voters.
523,"MR. MURPHY:  Money became part of it, but it's a--it's a Hobson's choice for Republicans in California because the big unions in the last couple of years have spent $300 million on politics.  So you either can't raise enough money to compete and they swamp you--because the public employee unions run California politics, they paid for Jerry Brown's campaign.  Or,
you spend your own money, but if you're a self-funder, the press wants to make that money the issue."
524,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Well, let's talk..."
525,"MR. MURPHY:  So, you know, with a time machine, there are a lot of things you can do differently, I'm proud of Meg.  We fought hard for jobs, take on that pension system.  We had some tough answers that people just didn't want."
526,MR. GREGORY:  Let me stay with you on the tea party...
527,MR. MURPHY:  Yeah.
528,"MR. GREGORY:  ...because if you look at this on the coast, Democrats remain strong, in the heartland of the county, it was a real route."
529,MR. MURPHY:  Mm-hmm.
530,MR. GREGORY:  That's part of the tea party's strength...
531,MR. MURPHY:  Mm-hmm.
532,"MR. GREGORY:  ...white, working class voters..."
533,MR. MURPHY:  Right.
534,"MR. GREGORY:  ...the ones who voted for Hillary Clinton, for instance."
535,MR. MURPHY:  Sure.
536,MR. GREGORY:  But what is--what kind of fight are we going to see among Republicans with the tea party influence in Congress?
537,"MR. MURPHY:  Well, you know, a lot of the tea party is just fiscal conservatism, which is a totally positive force, and that was a lot of the message.  I think the media tends to kind of grab a part of the tea party, the ""funnier the hat the better,"" and vilify them.  So I think we've got to be careful as we look at this not to, not to have an analysis that doesn't look at all the voters, the 15 percent of the country or more who say they identify.  That said, we've got some problems.  I've got a bone to pick with Jim DeMint.  I, I take the position of many Republican senators, in some ways, he was Harry Reid's secret weapon.  You don't go into Delaware as a party leader, gin up a primary.  You know, primaries can do whatever they want and--but then in a Northeastern state, we threw away a perfectly good Senate seat."
538,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
539,MR. MURPHY:  Similar situation in Nevada.  We could be at 49 or 50 seats right now.  So I think there has to be some level of pragmatism inside the party leadership to provide some guidance here because I don't want to throw away Senate seats.  And I think it was a mistake.
540,"MR. GREGORY:  What, Karen Hughes, what about the accountability, for a moment, of the Republicans on where they are going to cut the budget. They're making some big promises.  Are they going to cut the prescription drug benefit that Bush passed?  You know, are they going to deal with, with some of this spending?  You know, President Bush tried private
accounts in Social Security. It did not work, and it was his own party that part of the big problem there."
541,"AMB. HUGHES:  Well, I think we have to earn trust, and I think now that we control the House, we have an opportunity to take votes and to pass legislation every week.  We need to, we need to cut spending, we need to say that there's not going to be a $6 trillion tax cut that would kill jobs and hurt the, the fledgling economic recovery on--and that needs to be our priority one.  We need to, to offer solutions.  We can start with, perhaps, not authorizing the stimulus spending that hasn't been spent."
542,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
543,"AMB. HUGHES:  It's clearly not worked.  Unemployment's stuck at 9.6 percent, although the president promised it wouldn't go over 8, and so it's not working."
544,MR. GREGORY:  But...
545,"AMB. HUGHES:  And so we need to, we need to begin to earn trust.  And let me make one more point, David."
546,MR. GREGORY:  Yes.
547,"AMB. HUGHES:  Much has been made of the fact that we control the House and not the Senate.  However, we have 47 Republicans now in the Senate and there are 23 Democrats who have to run for election in 2012 and who are going to listen to the message of this election..."
548,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
549,AMB. HUGHES:  ...and perhaps be a little worried about voting...
550,"MR. GREGORY:  Republicans and Democrats, by the way."
551,AMB. HUGHES:  ...about voting against spending cuts...
552,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
553,AMB. HUGHES:  ...and limiting government in the next two years.
554,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but let's talk about tax policy."
555,AMB. HUGHES:  So I don't buy that we can't get things passed.
556,"MR. GREGORY:  Marc Morial, let's talk about tax policy."
557,MR. MORIAL:  Hm.
558,"MR. GREGORY:  Because you know, you could be for all the tax cuts across the board, Republicans and Democrats have to come to grips with the fact that you may have to raise taxes if you really want to bring the budget under control at some point."
559,"MR. MORIAL:  A lot of this is what I call ""Star Wars"" economics.  ""Let's quote cut spending, let's cut taxes, and let's also balance the budget."" And the reality check is that you can't cut, tax your way out of the debt problems that face--I'm part of an effort that's going to release a
report soon on debt reduction and there's some very difficult choices to be made.  But let me say this about the Bush tax cuts and my thinking. My thinking is to--that the plan needs to be recast.  It's a 2001 tax cut plan that was designed as a stimulus to the recession that was taking place.  Why can't we develop a new tax plan that might place greater tax relief for those at the middle and working levels?  This tax plan gave those at the middle and working levels scant relief and gave greater relief to those up at the top.  So I'm saying why can't--it's a false choice to say keep them or scrap them.  It's a better choice to say let's design a tax plan for 2010 that confronts the problems of 2010."
560,"MR. GREGORY:  Anita, your point here?"
561,"MS. DUNN:  I think that's a good point.  I mean, the reality is the reason that, that they expire this year is because the Republican Congress didn't want to say how they were going to pay for them in the out years, which is the problem that they will have today.  The, you know, if you look at what the, if you look at what the Republicans have been saying between their proposal to extend an additional tax cut to the wealthiest people in the country, which is $700 billion, and getting rid of the $500 billion of savings in Medicare Advantage, the first two
things they could do is increase the deficit by $1.2 trillion, $1.3 trillion, again.  David, you know, the Republicans have said they want to--spending cuts.  They won't tell you what they're going to cut. They've said that we, and Senator DeMint this morning said, we have to
fix Social Security and Medicare.  But apparently that doesn't involve making any tough choices.  Now that they control the House of Representatives, they can't just say, ""We're going to cut spending.  They actually have to propose cuts in spending."""
562,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, I'm going to take..."
563,"AMB. HUGHES:  Yeah, I think we're reading to do that."
564,MR. GREGORY:  Hold on.
565,AMB. HUGHES:  You just heard from a governor...
566,"MS. DUNN:  Well, I..."
567,AMB. HUGHES:  ...a great Republican governor who is doing exactly that in his state. 
568,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
569,"MS. DUNN:  Well, we haven't heard from anybody in the U.S. Senate or the House yet, you haven't heard what they'll cut, Karen."
570,"MR. MURPHY:  Stay tuned, though."
571,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, I'm going to..."
572,MR. MURPHY:  Stay tuned.
573,"MR. GREGORY:  I'm going to, I'm going to..."
574,"AMB. HUGHES:  We'll be, we'll be seeing a lot of votes on that."
575,"MR. GREGORY:  Right, we will stay tuned.  I'm going to take a quick break here, and we're going to come back with just a couple of moments left, talk about the legacy of George W. Bush.  He's speaking to Matt Lauer, his new book coming out.  We'll talk about that and get some final thoughts from our roundtable, right after this."
576,(Announcements)
577,"MR. GREGORY:  Final moments with our roundtable.  George W. Books--Bush's new book, ""Decision Points,"" is about to be released, his memoir.  He sat down with NBC's Matt Lauer, an interview that will air tomorrow night. And Matt asks him in part why he writes this book.  Does he want to try to cement perceptions about his presidency or change perceptions?  This
is the president's answer."
578,(Videotape)
579,"PRES. GEORGE W. BUSH:  Well, I, kind of.  But the main purpose of the book is to have a starting point, or not a starting point, just a data point for future historians.  Because I, you got--this may seem strange to you, I really don't care about perceptions at this point in time.  I, I served.  I gave it my all, and I'm a content man.  And the book has been a part of the transition process to private life, and it's a way for me to put the reader in the environment in which I had to make decisions."
580,(End videotape)
581,"MR. GREGORY:  Karen Hughes, you were there the whole time.  Is this an attempt to rehabilitate the Bush presidency?"
582,"AMB. HUGHES:  I think it's a very candid and fascinating and good read account of the decisions, the major decisions that, that President Bush made in office--the way he saw them, the kind of information he got, the kind of debate that took place, and the things he got right as well as the things he got wrong.  And it's a very candid accounting of that.  He says in a number of places, ""I got this wrong.  I should have done this differently."" He talks about the things that he got right.  He talks about the principles that he used to make decisions.  And so I think people are really going to enjoy it. On every page, I see the person that I know and that, that you covered in the campaign, David."
583,MR. GREGORY:  Anita Dunn...
584,MS. DUNN:  Yes.
585,MR. GREGORY:  ...20 seconds left.  Have views about the president changed?
586,MS. DUNN:  About President Bush?
587,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
588,"MS. DUNN:  I think views always change about presidents the further you get away from the presidency, and that the good things that happen tend to come into greater prominence, and that some of the emotions around presidencies fade."
589,"MR. GREGORY:  Final thoughts, 10 seconds."
590,"MR. MURPHY:  I think presidents should be able to litigate from inside what happened.  It's the most important point of view.  People ought to read it and learn, and I think history will be very good to President Bush..."
591,MR. GREGORY:  Interesting.  We're...
592,MR. MURPHY:  ...compared to current thoughts.
593,MR. GREGORY:  We're going to leave it there.  Thanks to all of you.
594,"MR. MORIAL:  Thank you, David."
595,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Before we go, a special programming note.  Tune in to NBC tomorrow night, 8 PM, Matt Lauer's exclusive interview with President Bush, his first since leaving office.  Matt will also be joined live by President Bush on the ""Today"" show Wednesday morning."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY: This Sunday, the politics of the economy at home and abroad.  The president is dealt a setback at the economic summit in Asia over trade and a rebuke of his approach to economic recovery.  At home, the debate over the Bush-era tax cuts and the co-chairs of the president's debt commission propose taking the knife to Social Security, Medicare, and the defense budget.  After the election, will the White House and Republicans be capable of finding common ground? My guest this morning, the president's senior adviser, David Axelrod, in his first Sunday interview since the Democratic losses at the polls.

11,"MR. GREGORY: Some of the headlines from the trip were not very good.  A setback at the polls on Election Day and then headlines like this from The New York Times on Friday, ""Obama's Economic View is Rejected on World Stage; China, Britain and Germany Challenge U.S. - Trade Talks With Seoul Fail, Too."" And The Wall Street Journal over the weekend, ""U.S. Gets Rebuffed at Divided Summit."" After an Election Day setback, has the president also lost his ability to forge international consensus on the world stage?"
12,"MR. AXELROD: Not at all, David.  And if you had more time, I'm sure you'd show the positive headlines from the trip as well.  The president went on this mission because Asia's the most vibrant market, growing market in the world and we want to compete for those jobs and that's why he went. And his first stop was in India, a growing power in the world.  And we saw American businesses walk away with $10 billion in new deals, 50,000 jobs back here. We strengthened that key relationship.  And we went on and we forced the agenda at the G-20 to focus on this issue of trade imbalances, which is an important thing."
13,"Now, it's, it's obviously going to be the case that countries are going to pursue their national interests.  Germany is a great exporter.  That's all--that's, that's the, the core of their economy.  They don't want greater competition from us.  China, we know the same.  So there are going to be--there's going to be tug and pull in these.  But the point is you have a president of the United States who's out there fighting for American jobs.  In Korea we want a trade agreement because Korea is a, a huge market in which we want to sell American  products.  But what the president said was the deal that was on the table wasn't good enough, wasn't good enough for the auto industry, wasn't good enough for American beef.  We want to keep on negotiating, and that's what we're going to do."
14,MR. GREGORY: Let...
15,MR. AXELROD: We're going to make the best deal for the American worker and the American industry.
16,"MR. GREGORY: Let's talk about another hot topic, and that is the issue of the Bush-era tax cuts.  A lot of back and forth involving you this week about what's going to happen here, whether there'll be extended.  I want to go back to December of 2008, you were on this program and you were unequivocal about the president's position.  Take a look."
17,"(Videotape, December 28, 2008)"
18,MR. GREGORY: Will you hold off on any tax increases?
19,"MR. AXELROD: Well, look, the question is on the Bush tax cuts for the very wealthiest Americans, and it's something that we plainly can't afford moving forward, and whether it, it, it expires or whether we repeal it a little bit early, we'll determine later, but it's going to go, it has to go."
20,(End videotape)
21,"MR. GREGORY: ""It has to go."" With the new political reality in Washington, has the president changed his view? "
22,"MR. AXELROD: No.  The president still believes that we have to move forward on these tax cuts for the middle class.  The middle class has taken a beating in this last decade.  They've seen their incomes decline, and they've borne the brunt of this recession, but we can't afford to borrow another $700 billion to pay for tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.  You know, your next guest, Senator McCain, was very courageous in 2003 when he voted against the second Bush tax cut, because he said it was irresponsible to, to, to pay for these--to borrow money for these tax cuts skewed to the wealthy at a time when we had two wars
and so many other pressures.  And that is still the case. So the president's..."
23,MR. GREGORY: But are you saying--so you're saying no deal... 
24,MR. AXELROD: ...position has--the president has not changed.
25,MR. GREGORY: ...no compromise.
26,"MR. AXELROD: Well, you're asking me--I'm telling you what the president's position is.  We need to move forward on the middle-class tax cuts.  We cannot afford a permanent extension of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, which would cost us $700 billion that we don't have over the next 10 years."
27,"MR. GREGORY: Right.  All right, but I know..."
28,"MR. AXELROD: We, we simply shouldn't do that."
29,"MR. GREGORY: ...the, I know the arguments.  Here's the question.  If the president could get an agreement on middle class tax cut extension, would he agree to an extension, at least temporary, for the tax cuts on the upper earners?"
30,"MR. AXELROD: David, we're looking forward to sitting down with leaders of both parties and talking about those issues.  I'm not going to negotiate that with you here.  There have been a lot of formulations thrown out in the last few weeks that are interesting, but we fundamentally want to uphold the principles that I laid out, and we believe that Congress should act before the first of the year.  These taxes, the way the Bush tax cuts were designed, are going to expire on January 1.  We want people to have the certainty of knowing that's not going to happen.  And Congress ought to--before they go on vacation, they ought to ensure that
people have better vacations of their own by knowing that this matter has been taken care of."
31,MR. GREGORY: All right.  Bottom line...
32,MR. AXELROD: So we're going to work hard to do that.
33,"MR. GREGORY: Bottom line, he's open to compromise.  Is that fair?"
34,"MR. AXELROD: The bottom line is he wants to sit down and talk about this, but..."
35,MR. GREGORY: Is he open to compromise?
36,"MR. AXELROD: ...as to your original question--there's no, there's no bend on the, on the permanent extension of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans."
37,MR. GREGORY: He's open to compromise.
38,"MR. AXELROD: He wants to sit down--we want to get this done.  The American people expect to get this done, and we, we are, we are eager to sit down and talk about how to move forward."
39,"MR. GREGORY: The president said after the election that he endured a ""shellacking,"" his word.  What is the course correction for this president as he moves forward?"
40,"MR. AXELROD: Look, I think that, fundamentally, what drove the electorate were two things.  One is that while we have a recovery, while we've had 10 straight months of job growth after a horrendous downturn, it hasn't been fast enough.  We still have millions of people looking for jobs, we still have--we need more robust growth.  I think that was one of the messages and that was the primary message that we heard in that election. The second is they want us to work together to do it.  In many instances, we had to move as one party in Congress, or virtually as one party because the other party decided that they did not want to participate as a strategy.  Now I think the country is saying to both Republicans and Democrats, ""Forget about the politics for a while.  Sit down and work together to solve these problems and get this economy moving at a faster pace."" And that's what we intend to do."
41,"MR. GREGORY: OK, but I'm not hearing from you so far this morning where the president is prepared to give and change this dynamic.  I'm hearing on the issue of taxes, on the issue of what happened in the election still plenty of fight.  I'm sure your supporters are happy to hear that. What I'm wondering is, how does the president course correct, change the dynamic to actually get something done?"
42,"MR. AXELROD: Well, you know, here's the thing, David.  That is more important in a conversation between the president and members of both parties than me talking to you here.  I think those are issues that we need to move forward on.  I think on--there are plenty of economic issues.  We proposed a--to--a tax cut that would all allow businesses to buy capital equipment next year without paying the taxes on them in, in 2011.  That would get the economy moving.  We proposed a permanent tax cut for research and development.  That would get the economy moving. There are other ideas.  These are ideas that Republicans have
traditionally supported.  We ought to sit down and work on these things together and, and get this--and get these things done so the economy grows at a faster pace."
43,"MR. GREGORY: Let me ask you about the, the debt commission, the president's debt commission.  The chairman came out maybe a little earlier than they had planned and put forth a rather Draconian document about how to slash spending and deal with the deficit.  The New York Times summarized it this way--to bring viewers into it, let me put it on the screen: ""The chairman ... outlined a politically provocative and economically ambitious package of spending cuts and tax increases.  ..."
44,"""The plan calls for deep cuts in domestic and military spending, a gradual 15-cents-a-gallon increase in the federal gasoline tax, limiting or eliminating popular tax breaks in return for lower"" taxes, "" and benefit cuts and an increased retirement age for Social Security."" Here's
the bottom line, if they don't get 14 commission members to agree to this, this is an intellectual exercise and not a real document.  Can they get to 14?"
45,"MR. AXELROD: I don't know whether they can or they can't, David.  But obviously they did a--it's a voluminous work and they have not yet completed it.  That was the chairman--chairman's recommendation, and now they're going to vote on it.  The president said that he'll comment on their work after they complete it.  That's his commitment to them.  But, look, it underscores what we knew.  The president appointed this commission, bipartisan commission, because this is a huge problem.  We have to deal with it, and it's not going to be easy to deal with.  And if one side says, No taxes on anyone can go up, any interest, any corporation, any individual, and then the other side says, No cuts can be made, then we're not going to solve it.  Everybody's going to have to give a little, and we're going to have to move forward and deal with this problem together.  And hopefully, whatever happens, this commission report will give the impetus to do that."
46,"MR. GREGORY: Is--so the president's position is, Look, everything has to be on the table."" Tax hikes, taking on entitlement spending, raising the retirement age for Social Security, on those specifics, all of those are on the table in the president's mind."
47,"MR. AXELROD: Yeah, I'm not going to deal with specifics because that would violate the president's commitment.  But I will say this.  There's no--the president has shown his willingness in the last two years.  You know, when we took on the healthcare issue, one of the reasons was that our budget people said we cannot deal with these deficits if we have an
inexorable climb in healthcare costs to the government, to businesses, to individuals, and so we did that.  And part of it was economies and the Medicare program.  We took away subsidies to insurance companies and made other economies that didn't affect patient care.  Unfortunately, the other party ran against us on it in the election and accused us of..."
48,MR. GREGORY: But why--but I have to ask you...
49,"MR. AXELROD: ...cutting Medicare.  We have to set, we have to set aside those kinds of tactics..."
50,MR. GREGORY: But I didn't even ask you for specifics.
51,MR. AXELROD: ...hold hands and move together.
52,"MR. GREGORY: I asked you whether everything was on the table.  And the level of caution from you on this--I mean, how are you going to expect both Democrats and Republicans to make painful choices if you can't even say publicly here today that those tough issues should at least be on the table?"
53,MR. AXELROD: The president--the president...
54,MR. GREGORY: And yet you expect Republicans to come to you.
55,"MR. AXELROD: David, David, the president empaneled this commission because he recognized that we had to take a, a, a wide lens look at this, and then--he said then everything should be on the table.  That hasn't changed.  What, what you want me to do, though, is, is react to
individual aspects of it here, and that, that I can't do because we need to see what the final report is.  But obviously there are going to be some hard choices to be made.  We're willing to make them.  It's going to take both parties together, working together to get them done."
56,MR. GREGORY: Speaker Pelosi said this draft report was unacceptable.  Did the president found--find that reaction counter-productive?
57,"MR. AXELROD: Look, there were reactions on--across the political spectrum. Some on the right, who said it was unacceptable.  Mr. Norquist and others on the right said, ""It raises taxes, we can't be for it."" Others on the left said it was unacceptable for other reasons.  I think
the best thing to do is wait for the final report, look at it, see where we can find common ground and move forward.  This is something the American people expect us to do, and we, we have to do it because we all know that this is a big dark cloud on our horizon and that--and the president is very intent on moving forward."
58,"MR. GREGORY: All right, before you go, two quick ones.  Rahm Emanuel, former chief of staff, now preparing to run for mayor in Chicago, in your town.  Will the president campaign for him?"
59,"MR. AXELROD: Well, the president hasn't--the president's made clear what his view of Rahm is.  He said he was an excellent chief of staff, thought he'd be an excellent mayor.  Whether he involves himself actively in this campaign is a matter that we haven't yet decided.  But I think his view of Rahm is very clear."
60,"MR. GREGORY: About Afghanistan.  My next guest, as you know, Senator McCain, is just back from Iraq and Afghanistan and has been critical of the timeline for the beginning of withdrawal, saying that, in fact, it is creating erratic behavior in Hamid Karzai, among others in the region,
because there's a sense that the U.S. will leave.  Is it a problem for the U.S. to announce the beginning of the end of the war? Does it undercut our policy?"
61,"MR. AXELROD: No, it's, it's, it's important that we announce the beginning of a drawdown.  We've always said it would be based on conditions on the ground, and that is still the case.  But it's important to let the Afghans know that they have to pick up the, pick up the pace
in terms of training up the military, training up their police, being ready to accept responsibility. And the--this, this beginning of the drawdown has a disciplining effect in that regard.  So it's important. We, we, we set it in conjunction with our military leadership.  Everyone
agreed that it was important, and it, and it's not going to shift."
62,"MR. GREGORY: All right, we'll leave it there.  David Axelrod in Chicago this morning, thank you as always."
63,MR. AXELROD: Good to be with you.  Thank you.
64,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Now the view from the other side of the aisle, Republican Senator John McCain."
65,"Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.  Welcome back to the country.  You were, as I said, in Iraq and Afghanistan.  You just heard David Axelrod say any withdrawal will be conditions based.  Is that not enough to satisfy you?"
66,"SEN. JOHN McCAIN (R-AZ): Well, I'd like to see the president say that it's only condition based.  According to Mr. Woodward's book, his problem is the political--the left base of the Democrat Party.  You don't fight and conduct wars that way.  You win and then you leave.  And that's what we've done in Iraq.  And the fact is, the perception is, amongst friends
and enemies alike, that we've--we may be leaving, And that has caused them to make certain accommodations because they can't leave.  I mean, it's just a fact."
67,"MR. GREGORY: Well, Hamid Karzai..."
68,"SEN. McCAIN: Down to the, down to the governor level."
69,MR. GREGORY: Right.
70,"SEN. McCAIN: Down to the police chief level they say, yes, the Taliban are telling us we're leaving and they're going to cut off our heads. Famous captive, Taliban captive, said to his American interrogator, ""You've got the watches, we've got the time."""
71,"MR. GREGORY: Well, but Hamid Karzai, who you met with, says in The Washington Post this morning that it's time for the U.S. to reduce the intrusiveness into daily Afghan life, that they ought to get boots that are on the ground off the ground, out of the country."
72,"SEN. McCAIN: Yes, and Hamid Karzai is reflecting his desire to survive, also a degree of paranoia.  There's three big problems in Afghanistan right now, and let me tell you one of them that isn't, and that is the military aspect of it.  Our Marines, Army, Navy, Air Force are doing a
magnificent job.  They are penetrating into areas that they haven't been before.  The hometown of Mullah Omar is now under our control.  So that's--they've done a magnificent job under the leadership of General Petraeus and others."
73,"The other side, though, is that there's corruption at very high levels. The attorney general of, of Afghanistan is corrupt.  It's just a fact. And also, we have, unfortunately, a situation in Pakistan where the enemy and ISI, Pakistani military intelligence, is working with and harboring
al-Haqqani network and other elements of Taliban.  You can't defeat the nemy if they have sanctuary.  We also went to Pakistan and had a, a very andid meeting with General Kayani on this issue.  But it boils down to hat the ISI, Kayani, the Pakistani leadership, the Afghan leadership, India's leadership, all are not convinced that the United States is going
to stay the course."
74,"MR. GREGORY: Let me, let me talk to you about another military matter back home and a priority for this administration; that's whether the ban on gays and lesbians in the military is going to be rescinded."
75,SEN. McCAIN: Mm-hmm.
76,"MR. GREGORY: Are you going to stand in the way, you personally, in the way of this ban being lifted?"
77,"SEN. McCAIN: I will stand that I want a thorough and complete study of the effect on morale and battle effectiveness of the United States military.  I will listen, as I've said for years, to our military leaders and not a, not a study that is leaked--as we know this town's pretty good
at that."
78,"MR. GREGORY: That said, seven in 10 members of the military think it would be just fine to have it lifted."
79,"SEN. McCAIN: Yeah.  You and I have not seen that study.  And this study was directed at how to implement the repeal, not whether the repeal should take place or not.  But, very importantly, we have people like the commandant of the Marine Corps, the three other--all four service chiefs are saying we need a thorough and complete study of the effects--not how
to implement a repeal, but the effects on morale and battle effectiveness.  That's what I want.  And once we get this study, we need to have hearings, and we need to examine it, and we need to look at whether it's the kind of study that we wanted.  It isn't, in my view,
because I wanted a study to determine the effects of the repeal on battle effectiveness and morale.  What this study is, is designed to do is, is to find out how the repeal could be implemented.  Those are two very different aspects of this issue."
80,"MR. GREGORY: In a lot of households, this is a subject of debate, including your own, apparently."
81,SEN. McCAIN: That's right.
82,"MR. GREGORY: Your wife, Cindy McCain, has, has cut an ad, a public service announcement with NOH8, a group that promotes gay, lesbian, transgender rights.  And this is a portion of it.  Let me, let me play it."
83,(Videotape from NOH8 public service announcement)
84,MS. CINDY McCAIN: Our political and religious leaders tell LGBT youth that they have no future.
85,MR. DAVE NAVARRO: They can't get married.
86,MR. STEPH JONES: They can't donate blood.
87,MS. McCAIN: They can't serve our country openly.
88,(End videotape)
89,"MR. GREGORY: Referring to ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell."" She did clarify this on her Twitter page.  I--you're both so active on Twitter.  She said this.  She said, ""I fully support the NOH8 campaign and all it stands for and am proud to be part of it.  But I stand by my husband's stance on
`don't ask, don't' tell.'"""
90,SEN. McCAIN: Which is a complete and thorough study and review of the effect on battle readiness and...
91,MR. GREGORY: OK.
92,"SEN. McCAIN: ...and morale.  And by the way, I respect the First Amendment rights of every member of my family."
93,"MR. GREGORY: But, but, you know, what's interesting about this, I mean, a debate in families, is..."
94,SEN. McCAIN: Sure.
95,"MR. GREGORY: ...there is kind of--you, you talk about waiting for the--there is an appeal to honor, I mean to your honor.  You had the chairman of the Joint Chiefs saying, ""Look, it's just not right to have, to have people lying about who they are just to be able to protect fellow
citizens."" It has been an appeal..."
96,"SEN. McCAIN: Yeah.  And you have the, you have the commandant of the Marine Corps who says..."
97,MR. GREGORY: Right.
98,"SEN. McCAIN: ...whose, whose people he's directly responsible for, is saying this could hurt our ability to win.  This, this is about..."
99,MR. GREGORY: Do you believe that?
100,SEN. McCAIN: This is about...
101,"MR. GREGORY: I mean, you say you wait for the study.  What do you believe?"
102,SEN. McCAIN: I'm paying attention to the commandant of the Marine Corps.
103,MR. GREGORY: Right.
104,"SEN. McCAIN: I'm paying attention to the chief of staff of the Air Force,
the Army and..."
105,"MR. GREGORY: But you're so close to the military, Senator.  You know these people.  You know the issue.  I mean, do you have a sense of it in your gut about what should happen?"
106,"SEN. McCAIN: I, I have a sense that I respect and admire these four service chiefs who have expressed either outright opposition or deep reservation about the repeal.  They're the ones who are in charge.  Now, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I agree, the president and the secretary of Defense have all come out for repeal.  But I really would--I was in, I was in an outpost near Kandahar.  Army master sergeant, 19 years in, fifth deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan, says to me, ""Senator McCain, we live, eat, sleep, and fight together in close proximity.  I'm concerned about the repeal.  I'd like to know more about it."" That's, that's the view that I got from chief petty officers and sergeants all over Afghanistan."
107,"MR. GREGORY: The ban's not going to be lifted in the lame duck session, is that fair to say?"
108,"SEN. McCAIN: I think that we should at least--I, I don't think it should be, because I think once this study comes out in the beginning of December, we should at least have a chance to review it and maybe have hearings on it."
109,MR. GREGORY: I just want to spend a couple of minutes on taxes and spending.
110,SEN. McCAIN: Mm-hmm.
111,"MR. GREGORY: This is your 59th appearance on MEET THE PRESS.  You know what that means.  We have so much tape.  So if we--if you go back to 2004, I know your, your..."
112,SEN. McCAIN: Yeah.
113,MR. GREGORY: ...position on the Bush tax cuts...
114,SEN. McCAIN: Yeah.
115,MR. GREGORY: ...did change and you've talked about that before.  But I do want to play something you said from an interview in 2004 and ask you about it.
116,"(Videotape, April 11, 2004)"
117,"SEN. McCAIN: I voted against the tax cuts because of the disproportional amount that went to the wealthiest Americans.  I would clearly support not extending those tax cuts in order to help address the, the deficit. But the middle income tax credits, the families, the child tax credits,
the marriage tax credit, all those I would keep."
118,(End videotape)
119,MR. GREGORY: That's exactly...
120,SEN. McCAIN: Is there
121,MR. GREGORY: ...what President Obama says.
122,"SEN. McCAIN: Is there a statute of limitations? The economic situation is vastly different today.  We are in the midst of the greatest recession in the history of this country since the Great Depression.  It is not the time to raise anyone's taxes.  And by the way, also along with that statement, I said we have to restrain spending, and spending was way out of control
at that time. I said otherwise we're facing massive deficits, and that's what happened."
123,MR. GREGORY: Should tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans only be extended for a temporary period and only if there are corresponding spending cuts?
124,"SEN. McCAIN: I think they should be extended until we're out of this recession.  At such time then we could look at, at other tax hikes.  But when we're in a serious recession, I cannot believe that raising taxes is a good thing on anybody."
125,MR. GREGORY: Is the debt commission a nonstarter or a good start or something else?
126,"SEN. McCAIN: I hope it's a starter.  I hope that even if they don't get the 14 members, as you mentioned earlier when you were talking with David Axelrod, that I hope that this is a wake-up call to America.  It gives us an idea of the breadth of this problem, that we are going to have to make significant changes, we're going to have to challenge some of the very, very tough areas such as entitlements if we're ever going to dig out of this hole."
127,MR. GREGORY: Everything should be on the table?
128,SEN. McCAIN: Everything should be on the table.
129,MR. GREGORY: Raising the retirement age?
130,"SEN. McCAIN: Everything should be on the table.  And if it's not, then, obviously, I don't think we're going to make progress.  And again, I'd like to applaud Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles because at least Americans--I think the lesson of this last election, the message was,
""Stop the spending, do things differently.  We're worried about our children and our grandchildren and we can't keep on going like we are."" And so maybe the environment has changed enough that Americans will respect us making some tough decisions."
131,MR. GREGORY: Just about a minute left.
132,SEN. McCAIN: Mm-hmm.
133,"MR. GREGORY: President Bush's memoir is out, ""Decision Points."" He talks about you in a couple of places.  And he talks about your decision not to have him campaign with you."
134,SEN. McCAIN: Mm-hmm.
135,"MR. GREGORY: And he writes this: ""I thought it looked defensive for John to distance himself from me.  I was confident I could have helped him make the case."" Any regrets that you kept him on the sidelines?"
136,"SEN. McCAIN: No.  That--it was a decision made at the time of the campaign. I respect and admire President Bush.  At the time, it's just was the realities of the political situation.  As you know, then--President Obama, at the time, was doing everything he could to tie me to President Bush.  I admire and respect and I believe I called President Bush a friend.  And it was just a decision we made and I hope he respects it."
137,"MR. GREGORY: There was a meeting--he talks about September of '08, the height of the financial collapse.  You suspend your campaign, call for a meeting in the White House.  Here's a picture of it.  You're there--actually, you're next to Boehner there.  And, and then-Senator
Obama there as well.  And he writes that he was surprised that you actually--you, you had called this meeting, you didn't really add that much substantively, didn't have a question, suggesting that you were unprepared for the meeting.  Is that fair?"
138,"SEN. McCAIN: I was prepared for the meeting.  I wasn't prepared for the onslaught that came, took place from all of the Democrats in the room. My reason for being there was to make sure that Republicans were heard, people like Boehner, Mitch McConnell and others.  That was the reason why I was there.  I didn't think I was going to make any headway with some of the Democrats who were in the room.  But I didn't ask for that meeting. But the fact is that I thought it was best, at that time, to say, ""I want Republicans to be heard."" Until that time, they had been shut out of the process."
139,"MR. GREGORY: We'll leave it there until your 60th appearance.  Senator,
thank you, as always."
140,SEN. McCAIN: Thanks for having me on.
141,MR. GREGORY: Appreciate it.

148,"But Alan Greenspan, Dr.  Greenspan, let me begin with you.  Where are we on our search for jobs and on our overall economic outlook?"
149,"DR. ALAN GREENSPAN: Well, our search for jobs is still, well, not doing too well.  The, the 10 percent unemployment rate is the consequence of the fact that this economy is not picking up the way it ordinarily would out of a recession.  And the basic reason is that, unlike previous
recoveries when, for example, we would be getting very significant pickups in building, residential, nonresidential, in a sense, longer term assets, we're not getting that today, and it's a big hole in the economy. And the reason, essentially, as far as the business section is--sector is concerned, is that business is highly uncertain about the future in a way which I have never seen it before and a way in which the data suggests has never, in fact, been so depressed. And unless and until we can begin to lift that pall of uncertainty, it is very difficult to see people reaching out into the longer term.  In other words, remember, buildings are 20, 30-year investments."
150,MR. GREGORY: Right.
151,"DR. GREENSPAN: And what the data show is that they are--there's extremely high risk aversion in what a columnist called ""illiquid assets"" like buildings."
152,"MR. GREGORY: Speaker Gingrich, President Obama was on the air a week ago and he talked about a new normal in our economy.  Let me play a portion of that interview and have you react to it."
153,"(Videotape, ""60 Minutes,"" last Sunday)"
154,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA: What is a danger is that we stay stuck in a new normal where unemployment rates stay high.  People who have jobs see their incomes go up, businesses make big profits, but they've learned to do more with less and so they don't hire.  And as a consequence, we keep on seeing growth that is just too slow to bring back the eight million
jobs that were lost."
155,(End videotape)
156,MR. GREGORY: Do you accept that?
157,"FMR. REP. NEWT GINGRICH (R-GA): No.  I think, I think we have two enormous policy challenges.  The first is that we're now in a world market, a genuine world market where you've got to think about economics in terms of competing with China, India, Germany.  And you ought to study Germany, which is a high cost country with a huge export manufacturing
base.  Second, this administration is just wrong.  I mean, the Obama model of the economy's just fundamentally, profoundly wrong.  And I don't care--I think Chairman Bernanke is very foolish to be printing $600 billion of additional money, because the fact is, the problems in this
economy are problems of fiscal policy, they're problems of taxation, and they're problems of an anti-business, anti-jobs bureaucracy that this president encourages."
158,"MR. GREGORY: We prop up the economy, Harold, for--we're certainly propping up the housing market.  And so we're in this state.  You agree with that?"
159,"FMR. REP. HAROLD FORD JR. (D-TN): In large part.  But let me differ a little bit with the speaker.  I think there are two kinds of debt here. The first is the debt we're accumulating as a result of this crisis.  And we can't ignore the fact that to get America back on a growth trajectory and growth platform, there's some steps that government's going to have
to take.  I agree with the chairman wholeheartedly that certainly around taxes and regulations going forward, I hope that the administration will call for a year moratorium on regulations.  I hope they extend the tax cuts and even cut the corporate rate.  But to suggest that the Fed should not continue to play an active role, especially in the face of some inaction from--on the fiscal side I think is wrong."
160,"Two, the entitlement debt.  I think that recommendations made by this deficit reduction commission have been responsible.  There may be some areas where we disagree with, but I hope the left in my party and the right in the Republican Party don't scream so loud that they scare the crowded middle."
161,"MR. GREGORY: And I, and I want to get back to the debt commission."
162,"But, Bethany McLean, let me bring you into this.  A big part of your book, of course, deals with the, the financial collapse and the housing market. The--what--we don't talk about this enough, that--the fact that the government is propping up the housing market.  Prices have not come down far enough, even though there's so much pain out there and such a crisis out there.  Can the economy really rebound unless the housing market corrects fully?"
163,"MS. BETHANY McLEAN: It's a great question, and it's a really interesting thing because one of the great ironies of the financial crisis, one of the big complaints is that government involvement in the housing market was a factor. People want to overplay it as ""the factor""; it was a factor.  But the great irony is that we've come out of the financial crisis with the, the housing market even more reliant on the government. It's now some 90 percent of the housing market.  And I don't know if anybody has the guts to see what happens if you yank government support away from the housing market right now.  But I think if you don't do
that, it's hard to argue that we've found, that we've found a real bottom in, in, in housing prices.  But doing so will risk putting the economy into more of a tailspin."
164,"MR. GREGORY: And, Alan Greenspan, again, another kind of bottom line question, is there a second crash out there that you fear?"
165,"DR. GREENSPAN: No, I don't.  In fact, we are in a position where we are moving forward largely because the rest of the world is moving forward. So we're moving forward, we're moving forward, but at too slow a pace to bring the unemployment rate down.  But there's very little evidence of any deterioration that suggests we're about to have a double dip, as they call it. And, in fact, if there's any evidence at all, we are actually picking up some. Through the month of November, industrial production is clearly improving, and there's all evidence out there that there's a very mild degree of acceleration in the American economy, but not enough to
get the system to function."
166,"MR. GREGORY: Well, let's talk about the debt commission because, Speaker Gingrich, you've been on the air this week disagreeing with some of these recommendations.  They've got to get to 14.  What I asked Senator McCain, is this a nonstarter, a starter, or something in between?"
167,"REP. GINGRICH: Well, the, the statement by the chairman is a nonstarter because, remember, you don't have to get to 14, you have to get to passage in the House and Senate."
168,MR. GREGORY: Right.
169,"REP. GINGRICH: Well, so the fact that they, they, they get together, they issue a statement guaranteed to frighten most Americans--which is what it did, I mean, a number of people are now calling me or e-mailing me about cutting Social Security--is absurd because it's not going to happen."
170,MR. GREGORY: But don't we have to have an adult conversation with people about what the real problem is?
171,"DR. GREENSPAN: Look, I think something equivalent to what Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson put out is going to be passed by the Congress.  The only question is, is it before or after a bond market crisis?"
172,MR. GREGORY: Right.
173,"DR. GREENSPAN: Because there's no alternative.  Look, I..."
174,MR. GREGORY: But you got to explain a little bit more what that means. You're talking about debt.
175,"DR. GREENSPAN: Well, here, here's the issue.  Right now we have very low bond prices, the markets are functioning in a reasonably good way.  The big, serious problem is whether or not the outlook for the longer term deficit spooks the bond market to a point where long-term interest rates and mortgage rates move up very sharply.  If that happens, that will cause the double dip. And I'm just basically hoping that we have enough sense to realize that we've got to resolve this issue before it gets forced upon us."
176,"MR. GREGORY: Bethany, I mean, David Brooks writes in his column on Friday about the politics here, and he writes this: ""The report from the chairman lists some of the best ways to raise revenue and cut spending."" ...  ""It comes with no enactment strategy,"" however.  ""In this climate, asking politicians to end the mortgage deduction and tax employer health care plans and raise capital gains taxes and cut benefits for affluent seniors is like asking them to jump on a buzzing sack full of live grenades.  They won't do it."""
177,"MS. McLEAN: And I think that's really scary.  The situation right now reminds me for all the world of the situation in the years leading up to the financial crisis.  We've got a big problem, except this one is even bigger. People can see it coming, and we need to take action.  And I
think if we don't take action, we're going to look back, perhaps when there is a bond market crisis, and say, ""Why didn't we do something when we had choices?"" And people at this table may disagree with me, but it seems to me that our budget problems aren't calculus, they're not
algebra, they're simple arithmetic. We're spending $3 for every $2 we take in.  Something needs to give."
178,"MR. GREGORY: I don't see why, for instance, some of these suggestions, Harold, on Social Security are going to be demagogued to death.  Why, in 50 years, people can't look at raising the retirement age and have that be a serious discussion point?"
179,"REP. FORD: Look, you can't pay off the debt without either cutting things or raising taxes.  This is a pretty good mixer of things.  The, the chairman is right in another regard.  This is going to happen.  We're going to have to deal with our deficit either by congressional and Senate and political leaders acting, or the global capital markets will impose a harsher set of realities on us, force interest payments to go up, and change our standing in the world. I would hope--and my--Speaker Gingrich is a friend.  He has been not only a leader in his--the Republican Party, he's been a leader in a lot of ways for calling for a new American way, a
new American majority.  I would hope that all of the smart minds in Republican and Democratic Party could come together and say, ""Look, this is painful, but we're going to have to do this."" If we're serious with all this talk about our kids and our grandkids, we're facing one of those
critical moments where..."
180,"MR. GREGORY: Well, well, let's, let's bring it more up-to-date, Speaker Gingrich.  The tea party movement itself, within the Republican Party, why don't you think there's more of a mandate for some really tough choices on, on government spending?"
181,"REP. GINGRICH: Let me, let me just come back for a second, David, because I want to suggest to you people can disagree without it being demagoguery.  I mean, I helped, working with Bill Clinton, we balanced the federal budget for four straight years, we paid off $405 billion in
debt.  It was not a trivial achievement.  It can be done.  It can't be done by sweeping, slashing generalizations by people who won't be affected.  And I'm just saying that this--the deficit commission, at the rate they're going, will actually be a step backwards, OK."
182,MR. GREGORY: Hm.
183,"REP. GINGRICH: The tea party movement wants real change, but they would start and say to you what John Boehner has said, the new speaker, ""Roll back the discretionary accounts to the 2008 level."" That's a trillion dollars over 10 years.  IBM and other technical companies have come in with a set of proposals that change the management of the federal government.  They believe that's another trillion dollars.  At the Center for Health Transformation, we published a study of fraud in Medicare and Medicaid because the federal government's such a bad manager.  That's $70 billion to $120 billion a year. Now, you can do a lot of things to get
back to a balanced budget without having to hurt the American people."
184,"MR. GREGORY: All right, let me get a break in here.  We're going to come back and talk a little bit more about this, also the tax cut issue, the Bush tax cuts, and a little politics as well.  Our economic discussion continues right after this station break."
185,(Announcements)
186,MR. GREGORY: We're back with the roundtable.  We're talking about this country's debt and the debt commission.
187,"Harold Ford, here were some of the scenes from around the world.  London, where you saw rioting in the street because of a hike of college tuition costs.  We remember in the past year the scenes from Greece.  Draconian cuts were introduced and there was social unrest.  I mean, is that what it could come to in this country if the politicians do move forward to
really tackle the debt?"
188,"REP. FORD: I hope not.  I think that there's a sense of who we are, what we represent, and why we're important to the world.  The notion of exceptionalism is thrown around, or the term is thrown around often.  I think people realize that we've built a lot of stuff in this country,
we've innovated, we've led. And for us to maintain that position, some changes are going to have to come about.  I think the rise of the tea party movement in some ways is positive for this discussion in that they recognize that overspending, overtaxing are challenges for the country. The same is true when you look back at the Clinton years.  He realized that as well.  There are smart, sensible people in both parties.  As long as you don't allow the far left and the far right, again, to crowd out the, the, the predominant middle, we can get a lot of this done.  If that means making tough choices on Social Security--I'm 40, I'm willing to
give mine up, and I think a lot of people my age who may reach a certain income level are willing to do the same.  But political leaders have to show some courage and will to make it happen."
189,"MR. GREGORY: I had, I had no idea you were that old."
190,"Newt--Speaker Gingrich, do you think this president has the political stroke that Bill Clinton did to actually forge a consensus on tough choices?"
191,"REP. GINGRICH: I have no idea.  I was a little disappointed in Mr. Axelrod's comments this morning.  But it took, it took President Clinton eight months from the time we won in November to his decision in June of '95 to work with us.  I mean, change on this scale is very wrenching, and it's wrenching for his staff, it's wrenching for his allies.  Frankly, I think Speaker Pelosi becoming the minority leader will make it harder. So I, I don't, I, I don't know what the president will do.  What I do--the only place I worry about in terms of the kind of riots you were showing is not Americans in general.  I believe the scale of change coming to government workers is going to be so great that you may well see, in places like Sacramento or Albany, New York, very serious unrest by union members who are offended at the idea that they should actually earn in proportion to the taxpayer and not be the new special class in America, which is what they've become over the last 20 years."
192,"MR. GREGORY: Let me get to the issue of tax cuts to both of you, Bethany and Dr.  Greenspan.  Dr.  Greenspan, we talked about this issue before, are tax cuts paid for? Or, to put it a different way, should the tax cuts on wealthier Americans be extended without corresponding spending cuts? What's going to happen? What should happen?"
193,"DR. GREENSPAN: Well, what's going to happen is that they're going to get extended.  I mean, that's very obvious, irrespective of what the rhetoric is, because that's the easiest thing to do politically at this stage. But we have to recognize that, longer term, the problem is spending.  You can't think about the concept of taxes until you ask, what is it that you're funding? At the moment, we are essentially borrowing more than a third of what we spend, and this is causing a huge increase in the debt, and it's not going to be easily reversed.  Look, as far as I'm concerned, what we're going to have to do is to essentially look at, not individual, piecemeal cuts or taxes, we have to look at whole projects.  I mean, for example, I happen to think Paul Ryan did a very important--was--made, made a very important contribution..."
194,MR. GREGORY: He's going to be chairman of the Budget Committee in the new Republican House.
195,"DR. GREENSPAN: Yeah.  Now, you can agree or disagree with his whole structure.  I happen to agree with almost all of it."
196,MR. GREGORY: Draconian cuts in Medicare and other programs.
197,"DR. GREENSPAN: Yeah.  But the problem here is that you're going to have to vote an up or down budget each time.  In other words, all of these budgets that are going to come up are going to be compromises.  You can't do it piecemeal.  And then the very fascinating question is how--and I ask my colleagues across the table here--how does the Congress deal with that sort of thing when the committees and the committee chairmen and the committees which have jurisdiction for all various aspects of the budget, are going to insist upon wanting to get into the middle of it?"
198,"MR. GREGORY: Well, let me get Bethany on the tax cut issue here, whether this is actually going to move forward or only on a temporary basis."
199,"MS. McLEAN: Well, I have to say I hope it does because I think if you look at economic history, the Bush tax cuts didn't put our economy on a sound footing.  The Obama spending didn't put our economy on a sound footing.  Since neither one has worked, let's try, let's try some of
both.  My big fear is that, is that we don't have as much time as Washington seems to think we have. And I say that because smart--the smart money on Wall Street has been talking about a sovereign debt crisis for a couple of years now, even before we had the conflagration in Greece."
200,MR. GREGORY: And what does that mean?
201,"MS. McLEAN: And--that, that, that means that we're going to have this bond market crisis that Dr.  Greenspan was talking about earlier sooner than we may expect.  And I worry that we have less time to fix this problem and less time to get our house in order than, than people seem to think."
202,"MR. GREGORY: What happens--an indulgence in an area that I spend time thinking about--if, if the big government companies, Fannie Mae and, and Freddie Mac, taken over by the government, if they guarantee 95 percent of the mortgage debt, there is no market now for mortgages, and the government says, ""Well, we got to wind these things down."" What's going
to happen here with the mortgage market?"
203,"MS. McLEAN: Two alternatives.  Either the private market does step up--and the case that some people argue, which is that the Fannie and Freddie are crowding out the private market, comes to the fore and the private market steps up and we're fine.  Or we have a huge collapse in housing."
204,"MR. GREGORY: You worry, Dr.  Greenspan, about propping up the housing market."
205,"DR. GREENSPAN: Well, let me just say this, that unless the housing market begins to move back, we're not going to have any significant cuts in the unemployment rate generally.  But at the moment, housing starts are as low as they can get and really just replace the number of units we need."
206,MR. GREGORY: Mm-hmm.
207,"DR. GREENSPAN: So that there's a question not of the housing market going down more, the key question here is the price of homes.  Because what we saw, for example, in 2005, 2006, is there were something like eight million new home purchases financed by conventional conforming mortgages, which means 20 percent down, and the like.  That eight million--those
eight million homes are now right on the edge of being so-called ""underwater."" And while the price levels of homes have been remarkably stable since the beginning of this year, the critical issue is that if they tilt below where they are now, say 5 or 10 percent, it's going to
create a major increase in foreclosures..."
208,MR. GREGORY: All right.
209,DR. GREENSPAN: ...with problems.
210,"MR. GREGORY: We're going to take a break here, come back with a last couple of minutes, talk a little politics before we close out the program.  Back in just a moment."
211,(Announcements)
212,MR. GREGORY: Back with a couple of closing thoughts.
213,"Speaker Gingrich, somebody made a smart point the other day, said, ""You know what, Newt Gingrich will be the first to announce for president. He'll do it in January in Iowa."" Where are you? You going to run?"
214,REP. FORD: I'm leaning back for you.
215,"REP. GINGRICH: How's that? It's like you and the Senate race last year. No, I, I think Callista and I'll make a decision probably in February; and probably, if we do run, we'll announce, I suspect, in late March. But we're still months away from that."
216,MR. GREGORY: What's going into your thinking on that?
217,"REP. GINGRICH: I think partially can you create a movement that really wants to get to fundamental change and can you make that bigger than the presidency. I don't you can solve problems in a country of 513,000 elected officials by focusing only on the Oval Office."
218,MR. GREGORY: Do you really think the president's vulnerable in 2012?
219,"REP. GINGRICH: Sure.  I mean--but he's not, he's not, he's not beaten. The--this president has enormous capacity to recover.  I think the economy will actually get marginally better over the next year, and he and the House Republicans will fight over who did it.  But I suspect
he'll--we'll be at closer to 8 percent than to 10 percent unemployment in '12."
220,MR. GREGORY: But the Republicans I talk to say that Sarah Palin and the tea party have created a whole new dynamic on the Republican side.  It is impossible to say who's got an early edge.  What is the impact?
221,"REP. GINGRICH: Yes.  I think that's exactly right, and I think it's like all the races we saw this year.  You will not know who the nominee is until very late in the spring of, of 2012 because Governor Palin has a role, Governor Huckabee has a role, Governor Romney has a role, you know, Governor Daniels. I mean, go down the list, Governor Pawlenty, Governor Barbour.  I mean, you could have 12 or 15 candidates out there early next year, and you won't know how the conversation leads to a decision until it actually happens."
222,"MR. GREGORY: Mm-hmm.  All right.  Well, we're going to leave it there. Thank you all very much for joining us today."
223,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  You can read an excerpt, by the way, of Bethany McLean's book, ""All the Devils Are Here:  The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis,"" plus watch our Take Two Web extra with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich about his latest novel, ""Valley Forge:  George
Washington and the Crucible of Victory."" It's all on our Web site at mtp.msnbc.com."
224,"That's all for today.  We'll be back next week.  An exclusive interview with Republican governor of Louisiana, Bobby Jindal.  Maybe he runs in 2012.  He's written a new book taking aim at the administration over the handling of the gulf oil spill."
225,"If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

MR. DAVID GREGORY:
This Sunday, the politics of the 
economy
 at 
home and abroad

economic
 summit in 
Asia
 over trade and a rebuke of his approach to 
economic
 recovery. At home, the debate over the 
Bush
 era 
tax cuts
 and the co- chairs of the president's debt 
commission
 propose taking the knife to 
Social Security
, 
Medicare
, and the 
defense budget

election
, will the 
White House
 and 
Republicans
 be capable of finding 
common ground
? My guest this morning, the president's senior adviser, 
David Axelrod
, in his first Sunday interview since the Democratic losses at the polls. Then the view from the 
Republicans
. Just back from 
Afghanistan
, 
ranking member
 of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee
, 
Senator John McCain
. Plus, a special focus on jobs, the future of the 
economy
, and whether 
Washington
 will take meaningful action on the debt. With us, former 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan

Announcer:
From 
NBC News

Washington

MEET THE PRESS
 with 
David Gregory
.
"
230,"
MR. GREGORY:
Good morning. 
President Obama
 on the way back from his 10-
day trip
 to 
Asia
, stopping a short time ago back on 
U.S.
 soil to refuel in 
Alaska
. He returns home to a host of domestic challenges and debates as a 
lame duck session
 of 
Congress
 begins tomorrow. Joining me now from 
Chicago
 this morning, the president's senior adviser, 
David Axelrod
. Mr. 
Axelrod
, welcome back.
"
231,"
MR. DAVID AXELROD:
Morning, 
David
. Good to be here.
"
232,"
MR. GREGORY:
Some of the headlines from the trip were not very good. A setback at the polls on 
Election Day
 and then headlines like this from 
The New York Times
 on Friday, ""
Obama
's 
Economic View
 is 
Rejected
 on 
World Stage
; 
China
, 
Britain
 and 
Germany Challenge U.S. Trade Talks With Seoul Fail
, Too."" And 
The Wall Street Journal
 over the weekend, ""U.S. Gets Rebuffed at Divided Summit."" After an 
Election Day
 setback, has the president also lost his ability to forge international consensus on the 
world
 stage?
"
233,"
MR. AXELROD:
Not at all, 
David
. And if you had more time, I'm sure you'd show the positive headlines from the trip as well. The president went on this mission because 
Asia
's the most vibrant 
market
, growing 
market
 in the 
world
 and we want to compete for those jobs and that's why he went. And his first stop was in 
India
, a 
growing power
 in the 
world
. And we saw American businesses 
walk away
 with $10 billion in new deals, 50,000 new jobs back here. We strengthened that key relationship. And we went on and we forced the agenda at the 
G-20
 to focus on this issue of trade imbalances, which is an important thing. Now, it's, it's obviously going to be the case that countries are going to pursue their national interests. 
Germany
 is a great exporter. 
That's all
 -- that's, that's the, the core of their 
economy
. They don't want greater competition from us. 
China
, we know the same. So there are going to be -- there's going to be tug and pull in these. But the point is you have a president of the 
United States
 who's out there fighting for 
American jobs
. In 
Korea
 we want a 
trade agreement
 because 
Korea
 is a, a huge 
market
 in which we want to sell American products. But what the president said was the deal that was on the table wasn't good enough, wasn't good enough for the auto industry, wasn't good enough for American beef. We want to keep on negotiating, and that's what we're going to do.
"
234,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let...
"
235,"
MR. AXELROD:
We're going to make the best deal for the American worker and the American industry.
"
236,"
MR. GREGORY:

Let's talk
 about another hot topic, and that is the issue of the 
Bush
 era 
tax cuts
. A lot of back and forth involving you this week about what's going to happen here, whether there'll be extended. I want to go back to December of 
2008
, you were on this program and you were unequivocal about the president's position. Take a look.
"
237,"

"
238,"
MR. GREGORY:
Will you hold off on any tax increases?
"
239,"
MR. AXELROD:
Well, look, the question is on the 
Bush tax cuts
 for the very 
wealthiest Americans
, and it's something that we plainly can't afford moving 
forward
, and whether it, it, it expires or whether we 
repeal
 it a 
little
 bit early, we'll determine later, but it's going to go, it has to go.
"
240,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
241,"

"
242,"
MR. GREGORY:
""It has to go."" With the new political reality in 
Washington
, has the president changed his view?
"
243,"
MR. AXELROD:
No. The president still believes that we have to move 
forward
 on these 
tax cuts
 for the 
middle class
. The 
middle class
 has taken a beating in this last decade. They've seen their incomes decline, and they've borne the brunt of this recession, but we can't afford to borrow another $700 billion to pay for 
tax cuts
 for millionaires and billionaires. You know, your next guest, 
Senator McCain
, was very courageous in 
2003
 when he voted against the second 
Bush
tax cut
, because he said it was irresponsible to, to, to pay for these -- to borrow money for these 
tax cuts
 skewed to the wealthy at a time when we had two wars and so many other pressures. And that is still the case. So the president's...
"
244,"
MR. GREGORY:
But are you saying -- so you're saying no deal...
"
245,"
MR. AXELROD:
...position has -- the president has not changed.
"
246,"
MR. GREGORY:
...no compromise.
"
247,"
MR. AXELROD:
Well, you're asking me -- I'm telling you what the president's position is. We need to move 
forward
 on the middle-class 
tax cuts
. We cannot afford a permanent extension of 
tax cuts
 for the 
wealthiest Americans
, which would cost us $700 billion that we don't have over the next 10 years.
"
248,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right. All right, but I know...
"
249,"
MR. AXELROD:
We, we simply shouldn't do that.
"
250,"
MR. GREGORY:
...the, I know the arguments. Here's the question. If the president could get an agreement on 
middle class
tax cut
 extension, would he 
agree
 to an extension, at least temporary, for the 
tax cuts
 on the upper earners?
"
251,"
MR. AXELROD:

David
, we're 
looking forward
 to sitting down with leaders of both parties and talking about those issues. I'm not going to negotiate that with you here. There have been a lot of formulations thrown out in the last few weeks that are interesting, but we fundamentally want to uphold the principles that are laid out, and we believe that 
Congress
 should act before the first of the year. These 
taxes
, the way the 
Bush tax cuts
 were designed, are going to expire on 
January 1
. We, we want people to have the certainty of knowing that's not going to happen. And 
Congress
 ought to -- before they go on vacation, they ought to ensure that people have better vacations of their own by knowing that this matter has been taken care of.
"
252,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. 
Bottom line
...
"
253,"
MR. AXELROD:
So we're going to work hard to do that.
"
254,"
MR. GREGORY:

Bottom line
, he's open to compromise. Is that fair?
"
255,"
MR. AXELROD:
The 
bottom line
 is he wants to sit down and talk about this, but...
"
256,"
MR. GREGORY:
Is he open to compromise?
"
257,"
MR. AXELROD:
...as to your original question -- there's no, there's no bend on the, on the permanent extension of 
tax cuts
 for the 
wealthiest Americans
.
"
258,"
MR. GREGORY:
He's open to compromise.
"
259,"
MR. AXELROD:
He wants to sit down -- we want to get this done. The American people expect to get this done, and we, we are, we are eager to sit down and talk about how to move 
forward
.
"
260,"
MR. GREGORY:
The president said after the 
election
 that he endured a ""shellacking,"" his word. What is the course correction for this president as he moves 
forward
?
"
261,"
MR. AXELROD:
Look, I think that, fundamentally, what drove the electorate were two things. One is that while we have a recovery, while we've had 10 straight months of 
job growth
 after a horrendous downturn, it hasn't been fast enough. We still have millions of people looking for jobs, we still have -- we need more robust growth. I think that was one of the messages and that was the primary message that we heard in that 
election
. The second is they want us to work together to do it. In many instances, we had to move as one 
party
 in 
Congress
, or virtually as one 
party
 because the other 
party
 decided that they did not want to participate as a strategy. Now I think the 
country
 is saying to both 
Republicans
 and 
Democrats
, ""Forget about the politics for a while. Sit down and work together to solve these 
problems
 and get this 
economy
 moving at a faster pace."" And that's what we intend to do.
"
262,"
MR. GREGORY:
OK, but I'm not hearing from you so far this morning where the president is prepared to give and 
change
 this dynamic. I'm hearing on the issue of 
taxes
, on the issue of what happened in the 
election
 still plenty of fight. I'm sure your supporters are happy to hear that. What I'm wondering is, how does the president course correct, 
change
 the dynamic to actually get something done?
"
263,"
MR. AXELROD:
Well, you know, here's the thing, 
David
. That is more important in a conversation between the president and members of both parties than me 
talking to you
 here. I think those are issues that we need to move 
forward
 on. I think on -- there are plenty of 
economic
 issues. We proposed a -- to -- a 
tax cut
 that would all allow businesses to buy 
capital
 equipment next year without paying the 
taxes
 on them in, in 
2011
. That would get the 
economy
 moving. We proposed a permanent 
tax cut
 for research and development. That would get the 
economy
 moving. There are other ideas. These are ideas that 
Republicans
 have traditionally supported. We ought to sit down and work on these things together and, and get this -- and get these things done so the 
economy
 grows at a faster pace.
"
264,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me ask you about the, the debt 
commission
, the president's debt 
commission
. The chairman came out maybe a 
little
 earlier than they had planned and put forth a rather 
Draconian
 document about how to slash spending and deal with the deficit. The New
"
265,"
York Times summarized it this way -- to bring viewers into it, let me put it on the screen:
""The chairman ... outlined a politically provocative and economically ambitious package of spending cuts and tax increases. ... ""The plan calls for 
deep cuts
 in domestic and 
military spending
, a gradual 15-cents-a-gallon increase in the 
federal
gasoline tax
, limiting or eliminating popular 
tax breaks
 in return for lower"" 
taxes
, and benefit cuts and an increased 
retirement age
 for 
Social Security
."" Here's the 
bottom line
, if they don't get 14 
commission
 members to 
agree
 to this, this is an intellectual exercise and not a real document. Can they get to 14?
"
266,"
MR. AXELROD:
I don't know whether they can or they can't, 
David
, but obviously they did a -- it's a voluminous work and they have not yet completed it. That was the chairman -- chairman's recommendation, and now they're going to vote on it. The president said that he'll comment on their work after they complete it. That's his commitment to them. But, look, it underscores what we knew. The president appointed this 
commission
, bipartisan 
commission
, because this is a huge 
problem
. We have to 
deal with it
, and it's not going to be easy to deal with. And if one side says no 
taxes
 on anyone can go up, any interest, any corporation, any individual, and then the other side says no cuts can be made, then we're not going to solve it. Everybody's going to have to give a 
little
, and we're going to have to move 
forward
 and deal with this 
problem
 together. And hopefully, 
whatever happens
, this 
commission
 report will give the impetus to do that.
"
267,"
MR. GREGORY:
Is -- so the president's position is, 'Look, everything has to be on the table."" Tax hikes, taking on entitlement spending, raising the 
retirement age
 for 
Social Security
, on those specifics, all of those are on the table in the president's mind.
"
268,"
MR. AXELROD:
Yeah, I'm not going to deal with specifics because that would violate the president's commitment. But I will say this. There's no -- the president has shown his willingness in the last two years. You know, when we took on the healthcare issue, one of the reasons was that our 
budget
 people said we cannot deal with these deficits if we have an inexorable climb in healthcare costs to the 
government
, to businesses, to individuals, and so we did that. And part of it was economies and the 
Medicare
 program. We took away subsidies to 
insurance companies
 and made other economies that didn't affect 
patient care
. Unfortunately, the other 
party
 ran against us on it in the 
election
 and accused us of...
"
269,"
MR. GREGORY:
But why -- but I have to ask you...
"
270,"
MR. AXELROD:
...cutting 
Medicare
. We have to set, we have to 
set aside
 those kinds of tactics...
"
271,"
MR. GREGORY:
But I didn't even ask you for specifics.
"
272,"
MR. AXELROD:
...hold hands and move together.
"
273,"
MR. GREGORY:
I asked you whether everything was on the table. And the level of caution from you on this -- I mean, how are you going to expect both 
Democrats
 and 
Republicans
 to make painful choices if you can't even say publicly here today that those tough issues should at least be on the table?
"
274,"
MR. AXELROD:
The president -- the president...
"
275,"
MR. GREGORY:
And yet you expect 
Republicans
 to come to you.
"
276,"
MR. AXELROD:

David
, 
David
, the president empaneled this 
commission
 because he recognized that we had to take a, a, a wide lens look at this, and then -- he said then everything should be on the table. That hasn't changed. What, what you want me to do, though, is, is react to individual aspects of it here, and that, that I can't do because we need to see what the 
final report
 is. But obviously there are going to be some hard choices to be made. We're 
willing
 to make them. It's going to take both parties together, working together to get them done.
"
277,"
MR. GREGORY:

Speaker Pelosi
 said this draft report was unacceptable. Did the president found -- find that reaction counter-productive?
"
278,"
MR. AXELROD:
Look, there were reactions on -- across the 
political spectrum
. Some on the right, who said it was unacceptable. Mr. 
Norquist
 and others on the right said, ""It raises 
taxes
, we can't be for it."" Others on the left said it was unacceptable for other reasons. I think the best thing to do is wait for the 
final report
, look at it, see where we can find 
common ground
 and move 
forward
. This is something the 
American people
 expect us to do, and we, we have to do it because we all know that this is a big dark cloud on our horizon and that -- and the president is very intent on moving 
forward
.
"
279,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, before you go, two quick ones. 
Rahm Emanuel
, former chief of staff, now preparing to run for mayor in 
Chicago
, in your town. Will the president campaign for him?
"
280,"
MR. AXELROD:
Well, the president hasn't -- the president's made clear what his view of 
Rahm
 is. He said he was an excellent chief of staff, thought he'd be an excellent mayor. Whether he involves himself actively in this campaign is a matter that we haven't yet decided. But I think his view of 
Rahm
 is very clear.
"
281,"
MR. GREGORY:
About 
Afghanistan
. My next guest, as you know, 
Senator McCain
, is just back from 
Iraq
 and 
Afghanistan
 and has been critical of the timeline for the beginning of withdrawal, saying that, in fact, it is creating erratic behavior in 
Hamid Karzai
, among others in the region, because there's a sense that the 
U.S.
 will leave. Is it a 
problem
 for the 
U.S.
 to announce 
the beginning of the end
 of the war? Does it undercut our policy?
"
282,"
MR. AXELROD:
No, it's, it's, it's important that we announce the beginning of a drawdown. We've always said it would be based on conditions on the ground, and that is still the case. But it's important to let the Afghans know that they have to pick up the, 
pick up the pace
 in terms of training up the 
military
, training up their police, being ready to accept responsibility. And the -- this, this beginning of the drawdown has a disciplining effect in that regard. So it's important. We, we, we set it in conjunction with our 
military
 leadership. Everyone agreed that it was important, and it, and it's not going to shift.
"
283,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, we'll leave it there. 
David Axelrod
 in 
Chicago
 this morning, thank you as always.
"
284,"
MR. AXELROD:
Good 
to be with you
. Thank you.
"
285,"
MR. GREGORY:
Now the view from the other side of the aisle, Republican Senator 
John McCain
. Welcome back to 
MEET THE PRESS
. Welcome back to the 
country
. You were, as I said, in 
Iraq
 and 
Afghanistan
. You just heard 
David Axelrod
 say any withdrawal will be conditions based. Is that not enough to satisfy you?
"
286,"
SEN. JOHN McCAIN (R-AZ):
Well, I'd like to see the president say that it's only condition based. According to Mr. 
Woodward's
 book, his 
problem
 is the political -- the left base of the 
Democrat Party
. You don't fight and conduct wars that way. You win and then you leave. And that's what we've done in 
Iraq
. And the fact is, the perception is, amongst friends and enemies alike, that we've -- we may be leaving, And that has caused them to make certain accommodations because they can't leave. I mean, it's just a fact.
"
287,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, 
Hamid Karzai
...
"
288,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Down to the, down to the governor level.
"
289,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
290,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Down to the 
police chief
 level they say, yes, the 
Taliban
 are telling us we're leaving and they're going to cut off our heads. Famous captive, 
Taliban
 captive, said to his American interrogator, ""You've got the watches, we've got the time.""
"
291,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, but 
Hamid Karzai
, who you met with, says in 
The Washington Post
 this morning that it's time for the 
U.S.
 to reduce the intrusiveness into daily Afghan life, that they ought to get boots that are on the ground off the ground, out of the 
country
.
"
292,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Yes, and 
Hamid Karzai
 is reflecting his desire to survive, also a degree of paranoia. There's three big 
problems
 in 
Afghanistan
 right now, and let me tell you one of them that isn't, and that is the 
military
 aspect of it. Our 
Marines
, 
Army
, 
Navy
, 
Air Force
 are doing a magnificent job. They are penetrating into areas that they haven't been before. The hometown of 
Mullah Omar
 is now under our control. So that's -- they've done a magnificent job under the leadership of 
General Petraeus
 and others. The other side, though, is that there's corruption at very high levels. The attorney 
general
 of, of 
Afghanistan
 is corrupt. It's just a fact. And also, we have, unfortunately, a situation in 
Pakistan
 where the enemy and 
ISI
, 
Pakistani military
 intelligence, is working with and harboring 
al- Haqqani
 network and other elements of 
Taliban
. You can't defeat the enemy if they have sanctuary. We also went to 
Pakistan
 and had a, a very candid meeting with 
General Kayani
 on this issue. But it boils down to that the 
ISI
, 
Kayani
, the Pakistani leadership, the Afghan leadership, 
India
's leadership, all are not convinced that the 
United States
 is going to stay the course.
"
293,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me, let me talk to you about another 
military
 matter back home and a priority for this 
administration
; that's whether the ban on gays and lesbians in the 
military
 is going to be rescinded.
"
294,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Mm-hmm.
"
295,"
MR. GREGORY:
Are you going to stand in the way, you personally, in the way of this ban being lifted?
"
296,"
SEN. McCAIN:
I will stand that I want a thorough and complete 
study
 of the effect on morale and 
battle
 effectiveness of the 
United States military
. I will listen, as I've said for years, to our 
military
 leaders and not a, not a 
study
 that is leaked -- as we know this town's pretty good at that.
"
297,"
MR. GREGORY:
That said, seven in 10 members of the 
military
 think it would be just fine to have it lifted.
"
298,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Yeah. 
You and I
 have not seen that 
study
. And this 
study
 was directed at how to implement the 
repeal
, not whether the 
repeal
 should take place or not. But, very importantly, we have people like the commandant of the 
Marine Corps
, the three other -- all four service chiefs are saying we need a thorough and complete 
study
 of the effects -- not how to implement a 
repeal
, but the effects on morale and 
battle
 effectiveness. That's what I want. And once we get this 
study
, we need to have hearings, and we need to examine it, and we need to look at whether it's the kind of 
study
 that we wanted. It isn't, in my view, because I wanted a 
study
 to determine the effects of the 
repeal
 on 
battle
 effectiveness and morale. What this 
study
 is, is designed to do is, is to find out how the 
repeal
 could be implemented. Those are two very different aspects of this issue.
"
299,"
MR. GREGORY:
In a lot of households, this is a subject of debate, including your own, apparently.
"
300,"
SEN. McCAIN:

That's right
.
"
301,"
MR. GREGORY:
Your wife, 
Cindy McCain
, has, has cut an ad, a 
public service announcement
 with 
NOH8
, a group that promotes gay, lesbian, 
transgender rights
. And this is a portion of it. Let me, let me play it.
"
302,"

"
303,"
MS. CINDY McCAIN:
Our political and religious leaders tell 
LGBT
 youth that they have no future.
"
304,"
MR. DAVE NAVARRO:
They can't get married.
"
305,"
MR. STEPH JONES:
They can't donate blood.
"
306,"
MS. McCAIN:
They can't serve our 
country
 openly.
"
307,"

"
308,"
MR. GREGORY:
Referring to ""don't ask, don't tell."" She did clarify this on her 
Twitter
 page. I- -you're both so active on 
Twitter
. She said this. She said, ""I fully support the 
NOH8
 campaign and all it stands for and am proud to be part of it. But I stand by my husband's stance on 'don't ask, don't' tell.'""
"
309,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Which is a complete and thorough 
study
 and review of the effect on 
battle
 readiness and...
"
310,"
MR. GREGORY:
OK.
"
311,"
SEN. McCAIN:
...and morale. And by the way, I respect the 
First Amendment rights
 of every member of my family.
"
312,"
MR. GREGORY:
But, but, you know, what's interesting about this, I mean, a debate in families, is...
"
313,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Sure.
"
314,"
MR. GREGORY:
...there is kind of -- you, you talk about waiting for the -- there is an appeal to honor, I mean to your honor. You had the chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs
 saying, ""Look, it's just not right to have, to have people lying about who they are just to be able to protect fellow citizens."" It has been an appeal...
"
315,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Yeah. And you have the, you have the commandant of the 
Marine Corps
 who says...
"
316,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
317,"
SEN. McCAIN:
...whose, whose people he's directly responsible for, is saying this could hurt our ability to win. This, this is about...
"
318,"
MR. GREGORY:
Do you believe that?
"
319,"
SEN. McCAIN:
This is about...
"
320,"
MR. GREGORY:
I mean, you say you wait for the 
study
. What do you believe?
"
321,"
SEN. McCAIN:
I'm paying attention to the commandant of the 
Marine Corps
.
"
322,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
323,"
SEN. McCAIN:
I'm paying attention to 
the chief of staff
 of the 
Air Force
, the 
Army
 and...
"
324,"
MR. GREGORY:
But you're so close to the 
military
, 
Senator
. You know these people. You know the issue. I mean, do you have a sense of it in your gut about what should happen?
"
325,"
SEN. McCAIN:
I, I have a sense that I respect and admire these four service chiefs who have expressed either outright opposition or deep reservation about the 
repeal
. They're the ones who are in charge. Now, the chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff
, I 
agree
, the president and the secretary of 
Defense
 have all come out for 
repeal
. But I really would -- I was in, I was in an outpost near 
Kandahar
. 
Army
 master sergeant, 19 years in, fifth deployment to 
Iraq
 and 
Afghanistan
, says to me, ""
Senator McCain
, we live, eat, sleep, and fight together in close proximity. I'm concerned about the 
repeal
. I'd like to know more about it."" That's, that's the view that I got from chief petty officers and sergeants all over 
Afghanistan
.
"
326,"
MR. GREGORY:
The ban's not going to be lifted in the 
lame duck session
, is that fair to say?
"
327,"
SEN. McCAIN:
I think that we should at least -- I, I don't think it should be, because I think once this 
study
 comes out in the beginning of December, we should at least have a chance to review it and maybe have hearings on it.
"
328,"
MR. GREGORY:
I just want to spend a couple of minutes on 
taxes
 and spending.
"
329,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Mm-hmm.
"
330,"
MR. GREGORY:
This is your 59th appearance on 
MEET THE PRESS
. You know what that means. We have so much tape. So if we -- if you go back to 
2004
, I know your, your...
"
331,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Yeah.
"
332,"
MR. GREGORY:
...position on the 
Bush tax cuts
...
"
333,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Yeah.
"
334,"
MR. GREGORY:
...did 
change
 and you've talked about that before. But I do want to play something you said from an interview in 
2004
 and ask you about it.
"
335,"

"
336,"
SEN. McCAIN:
I voted against the 
tax cuts
 because of the disproportional amount that went to the 
wealthiest Americans
. I would clearly support not extending those 
tax cuts
 in order to help address the, the deficit. But the 
middle income
tax credits
, the families, the child 
tax credits
, the marriage 
tax credit
, all those I would keep.
"
337,"

"
338,"
MR. GREGORY:
That's exactly...
"
339,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Yes, sir.
"
340,"
MR. GREGORY:
...what 
President Obama
 says.
"
341,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Is there a statute of limitations? The 
economic
 situation is vastly different today. We are in the midst of the greatest recession in the history of this 
country
 since the 
Great Depression
. It is not the time to raise anyone's 
taxes
. And by the way, also along that statement, I said we have to restrain spending, and spending was way out of control at that time. I said otherwise we're facing massive deficits, and that's what happened.
"
342,"
MR. GREGORY:
Should 
tax cuts
 on the 
wealthiest Americans
 only be extended for a temporary period and only if there are corresponding spending cuts?
"
343,"
SEN. McCAIN:
I think they should be extended until we're out of this recession. At such time then we could look at, at other tax hikes. But when we're in a serious recession, I cannot believe that 
raising taxes
 is a good thing on anybody.
"
344,"
MR. GREGORY:
Is the debt 
commission
 a nonstarter or a good start or something else?
"
345,"
SEN. McCAIN:
I hope it's a starter. I hope that even if they don't get the 14 members, as you mentioned earlier when you were talking with 
David Axelrod
, that I hope that this is a wake-up call to 
America
. It gives us an idea of the breadth of this 
problem
, that we are going to have to make significant changes, we're going to have to challenge some of the very, very tough areas such as entitlements if we're ever going to dig out of this hole.
"
346,"
MR. GREGORY:
Everything should be on the table?
"
347,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Everything should be on the table.
"
348,"
MR. GREGORY:
Raising the 
retirement age
?
"
349,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Everything should be on the table. And if it's not, then, obviously, I don't think we're going to make progress. And again, I'd like to applaud 
Alan Simpson
 and 
Erskine Bowles
 because at least 
Americans
 -- I think the lesson of this last 
election
, the message was, ""Stop the spending, do things differently. We're worried about our children and our grandchildren and we can't keep on going like we are."" And so maybe the environment has changed enough that 
Americans
 will respect us making some tough decisions.
"
350,"
MR. GREGORY:
Just about a minute left.
"
351,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Mm-hmm.
"
352,"
MR. GREGORY:

President Bush
's memoir is out, ""Decision Points."" He talks about you in a couple of places. And he talks about your decision not to have him campaign with you.
"
353,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Mm-hmm.
"
354,"
MR. GREGORY:
And he writes this: ""I thought it looked defensive for 
John
 to distance himself from me. I was confident I could have helped him make the case."" Any regrets that you kept him on the sidelines?
"
355,"
SEN. McCAIN:
No. That -- it was a decision made at the time of the campaign. I respect and admire 
President Bush
. At the time, it's just was the realities of the political situation. As you know, then -- 
President Obama
, at the time, was doing everything he could to tie me to 
President Bush
. I admire and respect and I believe I called 
President Bush
 a friend. And it was just a decision we made and I hope he respects it.
"
356,"
MR. GREGORY:
There was a meeting -- he talks about September of '08, the height of the financial collapse. You suspend your campaign, call for a meeting in the 
White House
. Here's a picture of it. You're there -- actually, you're next to 
Boehner
 there. And, and then-
Senator Obama
 there as well. And he writes that he was surprised that you actually -- you, you had called this meeting, you didn't really add that much substantively, didn't have a question, suggesting that you were unprepared for the meeting. Is that fair?
"
357,"
SEN. McCAIN:
I was prepared for the meeting. I wasn't prepared for the onslaught that came, took place from all of the 
Democrats
 in the room. My reason for being there was to make sure that 
Republicans
 were heard, people like 
Boehner
, 
Mitch McConnell
 and others. That was the reason why I was there. I didn't think I was going to make any headway with some of the 
Democrats
 who were in the room. But I didn't ask for that meeting. But the fact is that I thought it was best, at that time, to say, ""I want 
Republicans
 to be heard."" Until that time, they had been shut out of the process.
"
358,"
MR. GREGORY:
We'll leave it there until your 60th appearance. 
Senator
, thank you, as always.
"
359,"
SEN. McCAIN:
Thanks for having me on.
"
360,"
MR. GREGORY:
Appreciate it. Up next, our special focus on the 
economy

MR. GREGORY:
Coming up, jobs, the future of the 
economy

Washington

economic
 discussion featuring 
Alan Greenspan

Newt Gingrich
 right after this brief 
commercial break
.
"
363,"

"
364,"
MR. GREGORY:
We are back. Joining me this morning for our special discussion on the 
problems
 facing our nation's 
economy
, co-author of the new book on the 
financial crisis
, ""All the 
Devils Are Here
,"" 
Vanity Fair
's 
Bethany McLean
; former 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan
; co-author of the new novel ""
Valley Forge
: 
George Washington
 and the 
Crucible
 of 
Victory
,"" former speaker of the 
House
, Republican 
Newt Gingrich
; and chair of the 
Democratic Leadership Council
, former Congressman 
Harold Ford Jr
. Welcome to all of you. So much to discuss about the future of our 
economy
, the president on the 
world
 stage, 
free trade
, and his approach to 
economic
 recovery. But 
Alan Greenspan
, Dr. 
Greenspan
, let me begin with you. Where are we on our search for jobs and on our overall 
economic
 outlook?
"
365,"
DR. ALAN GREENSPAN:
Well, our search for jobs is still, well, not doing too well. The, the 10 percent 
unemployment rate
 is the consequence of the fact that this 
economy
 is not picking up the way it ordinarily would out of a recession. And the basic reason is that, unlike previous recoveries when, for example, we would be getting very significant pickups in building, residential, nonresidential, in a sense, longer term assets, we're not getting that today, and it's a 
big hole
 in the 
economy
. And the reason, essentially, as far as the business section is -- sector is concerned, is that business is highly uncertain about the future in a way which 
I have never seen
 it before and a way in which the data suggests has never, in fact, been so depressed. And unless and until we can begin to lift that pall of uncertainty, it is very difficult to see people reaching out into the longer term. In other words, remember, buildings are 20-, 30-year investments.
"
366,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
367,"
DR. GREENSPAN:
And what the data show is that they are -- there's extremely 
high risk
 aversion in what a columnist called ""illiquid assets"" like buildings.
"
368,"
MR. GREGORY:
Speaker 
Gingrich
, 
President Obama
 was on the air a week ago and he talked about a new normal in our 
economy
. Let me play a portion of that interview and have you react to it.
"
369,"

"
370,"
PRES. BARACK OBAMA:
What is a danger is that we stay stuck in a new normal where unemployment rates 
stay high
. People who have jobs see their incomes go up, businesses make big profits, but they've learned to do more with less and so they don't hire. And as a consequence, we keep on seeing growth that is just too slow to bring back the eight million jobs that were lost.
"
371,"

"
372,"
MR. GREGORY:
Do you accept that?
"
373,"
FMR. REP. NEWT GINGRICH (R-GA):
No. I think, I think we have two enormous policy challenges. The first is that we're now in a 
world market
, a genuine 
world market
 where you've got to think about economics in terms of competing with 
China
, 
India
, 
Germany
. And you ought to 
study
Germany
, which is a high cost 
country
 with a huge export manufacturing base. Second, this 
administration
's just wrong. I mean, the 
Obama
 model of the 
economy
's just fundamentally, profoundly wrong. 
And I
 don't care -- I think Chairman 
Bernanke
 is very foolish to be printing $600 billion of additional money, because the fact is, the 
problems
 in this 
economy
 are 
problems
 of 
fiscal policy
, they're 
problems
 of taxation, and they're 
problems
 of an anti-business, anti-jobs bureaucracy that this president encourages.
"
374,"
MR. GREGORY:
We prop up the 
economy
, 
Harold
, for -- we're certainly propping up the 
housing market
. And so we're in this state. You 
agree
 with that?
"
375,"
FMR. REP. HAROLD FORD JR. (D-TN):
In large part. But let me differ a 
little
 bit with the speaker. I think there are two kinds of debt here. The first is the debt we're accumulating as a result of this crisis. And we can't ignore the fact that to get 
America
 back on a growth trajectory and growth platform, there's some steps that 
government
's going to have to take. I 
agree
 with the chairman wholeheartedly that certainly around 
taxes
 and regulations going 
forward
, I hope that the 
administration
will call
 for a year moratorium on regulations. I hope they extend the 
tax cuts
 and even cut the corporate rate. But to suggest that the Fed should not continue to play an active role, especially in the face of some inaction from -- on the fiscal side I think is wrong. Two, the entitlement debt. I think that recommendations made by this deficit reduction 
commission
 have been responsible. There may be some areas where we disagree with, but I hope the left in my 
party
 and the right in the 
Republican Party
 don't scream so loud that they scare the crowded middle.
"
376,"
MR. GREGORY:

And I
, and I want to get back to the debt 
commission
. But, 
Bethany McLean
, let me bring you into this. A big part of your book, of course, deals with the, the financial collapse and the 
housing market
. The -- what -- we don't talk about this enough, that -- the fact that the 
government
 is propping up the 
housing market
. Prices have not come down far enough, even though there's so much pain out there and such a crisis out there. Can the 
economy
 really rebound unless the 
housing market
 corrects fully?
"
377,"
MS. BETHANY McLEAN:
It's a great question, and it's a really interesting thing because one of the great ironies of the 
financial crisis
, one of the big complaints is that 
government
 involvement in the 
housing market
 was a factor. People want to overplay it as ""the factor""; it was a factor. But the great irony is that we've come out of the 
financial crisis
 with the, the 
housing market
 even more reliant on the 
government
. It's now some 90 percent of the 
housing market
. 
And I
 don't know if anybody has the guts to see what happens if you yank 
government
 support away from the 
housing market
 right now. But I think if you don't do that, it's hard to argue that we've found, that we've found a real bottom in, in, in 
housing prices
. But doing so will risk putting the 
economy
 into more of a tailspin.
"
378,"
MR. GREGORY:
And, 
Alan Greenspan
, again, another kind of 
bottom line
 question, is there a second crash out there that you fear?
"
379,"
DR. GREENSPAN:
No, I don't. In fact, we are in a position where we are moving 
forward
 largely because the 
rest of the world
 is moving 
forward
. So we're moving 
forward
, we're moving 
forward
, but at too slow a pace to bring the 
unemployment rate
 down. But there's very 
little
 evidence of any deterioration that suggests we're about to have a double dip, as they call it. And, in fact, if there's any evidence at all, we are actually picking up some. Through the month of November, industrial production is clearly improving, and there's all evidence out there that there's a very mild degree of acceleration in the 
American economy
, but not enough to get the system to function.
"
380,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, let's talk about the debt 
commission
 because, Speaker 
Gingrich
, you've been on the air this week disagreeing with some of these recommendations. They've got to get to 14. What I asked 
Senator McCain
, is this a nonstarter, a starter, or something in between?
"
381,"
REP. GINGRICH:
Well, the, the statement by the chairman is a nonstarter because, no, you don't have to get to 14, you have to get to passage in the 
House
 and 
Senate
.
"
382,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
383,"
REP. GINGRICH:
Well, so the fact that they, they, they get together, they issue a statement guaranteed to frighten most 
Americans
 -- which is what it did, I mean, a number of people are now calling me or e-mailing me about cutting 
Social Security
 -- is absurd because it's not going to happen.
"
384,"
MR. GREGORY:
But don't we have to have an adult conversation with people about what the real 
problem
 is?
"
385,"
DR. GREENSPAN:
Look, I think something equivalent to what 
Erskine Bowles
 and 
Alan Simpson
 put out is going to be passed by the 
Congress
. The only question is, is it before or after a 
bond market
 crisis?
"
386,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
387,"
DR. GREENSPAN:
Because there's no alternative. Look, I...
"
388,"
MR. GREGORY:
But you got to explain 
a little bit more
 what that means. You're talking about debt.
"
389,"
DR. GREENSPAN:
Well, here, here's the issue. Right now we have very low bond prices, the markets are functioning in a reasonably good way. The big, serious 
problem
 is whether or not the outlook for the longer term deficit spooks the 
bond market
 to a point where long-term 
interest rates
 and 
mortgage rates
 move up very sharply. If that happens, that will cause the double dip. 
And I
'm just basically hoping that we have enough sense to realize that we've got to resolve this issue before it gets forced 
upon us
.
"
390,"
MR. GREGORY:

Bethany
, I mean, 
David Brooks
 writes in his column on Friday about the
"
391,"
politics here, and he writes this:
""The report from the chairman lists some of the best ways to raise revenue and cut spending."" ... ""It comes with no enactment strategy,"" however. ""In this climate, asking politicians to end the mortgage deduction and tax employer 
health care
 plans and raise 
capital gains
taxes
 and cut benefits for affluent seniors is like asking them to jump on a buzzing sack full of live grenades. They won't do it.""
"
392,"
MS. McLEAN:

And I
 think that's really scary. The situation right now reminds me for all the 
world
 of the situation in the years leading up to the 
financial crisis
. We've got a big 
problem
, except this one is even bigger. People can see it coming, and we need to take action. 
And I
 think if we don't take action, we're going to look back, perhaps when there is a 
bond market
 crisis, and say, ""Why didn't we do something when we had choices?"" And people at this table may disagree with me, but it seems to me that our 
budget
problems
 aren't calculus, they're not algebra, they're simple arithmetic. We're spending $3 for every $2 we take in. Something needs to give.
"
393,"
MR. GREGORY:
I don't see why, for instance, some of these suggestions, 
Harold
, on 
Social Security
 are going to be demagogued to death. Why, in 50 years, people can't look at raising the 
retirement age
 and have that be a serious discussion point?
"
394,"
REP. FORD:
Look, you can't pay off the debt without either cutting things or 
raising taxes
. This is a pretty good mixer of things. The, the chairman is right in another regard. This is going to happen. We're going to have to deal with our deficit either by congressional and 
Senate
 and 
political leaders
 acting, or the 
global capital
 markets will impose a harsher set of realities on us, force interest payments to go up, and 
change
 our standing in the 
world
. I would hope -- and my -- Speaker 
Gingrich
 is a friend. He has been not only a leader in his -- the 
Republican Party
, he's been a leader in a lot of ways for calling for a new 
American way
, a 
new American
 majority. I would hope that all of the smart minds in Republican and 
Democratic Party
 could come together and say, ""Look, this is painful, but we're going to have to do this."" If we're serious with all this talk about our kids and our grandkids, we're facing one of those critical moments where...
"
395,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, well, let's, let's bring it more up-to-date, Speaker 
Gingrich
. The 
tea party
 movement itself, within the 
Republican Party
, why don't you think there's more of a mandate for some really tough choices on, on 
government spending
?
"
396,"
REP. GINGRICH:
Let me, let me just come back for a second, 
David
, because I want to suggest to you people can disagree without it being demagoguery. I mean, I helped, working with 
Bill Clinton
, we balanced the 
federal budget
 for four straight years, we paid off $405 billion in debt. It was not a trivial achievement. It can be done. It can't be done by sweeping, slashing generalizations by people who won't be affected. 
And I
'm just saying that this -- the deficit 
commission
, at the rate they're going, will actually be a step backwards, OK?
"
397,"
MR. GREGORY:
Hm.
"
398,"
REP. GINGRICH:
The 
tea party
 movement wants 
real change
, but they would start and say to you what 
John Boehner
 has said, the new speaker, ""Roll back the discretionary accounts to the 
2008
 level."" That's a trillion dollars over 10 years. IBM and other technical companies have come in with a set of proposals that 
change
 the management of the 
federal government
. They believe that's another trillion dollars. At the 
Center
 for 
Health Transformation
, we published a 
study
 of fraud in 
Medicare and Medicaid
 because the 
federal government
's such a bad manager. That's $70 billion to $120 billion a year. Now, you can do a lot of things to get back to a 
balanced budget
 without having to hurt the 
American people
.
"
399,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, let me get a break in here. We're going to come back and talk 
a little bit more
 about this, also the 
tax cut
 issue, the 
Bush tax cuts
, and a 
little
 politics as well. Our 
economic
 discussion continues right after this 
station break
.
"
400,"

"
401,"
MR. GREGORY:
We're back with the roundtable. We're talking about this 
country
's debt and the debt 
commission
. 
Harold Ford
, here were some of the scenes from around the 
world
. 
London
, where you saw rioting in the street because of a hike of college tuition costs. We remember in the past year the scenes from 
Greece
. 
Draconian
 cuts were introduced and there was 
social unrest
. I mean, is that what it could come to in this 
country
 if the politicians do move 
forward
 to really tackle the debt?
"
402,"
REP. FORD:
I hope not. I think that there's a sense of who we are, what we represent, and why we're important to the 
world
. The notion of exceptionalism is thrown around, or the term is thrown around often. I think people realize that we've built a lot of stuff in this 
country
, we've innovated, we've led. And for us to maintain that position, some changes are going to have to come about. I think the rise of the 
tea party
 movement in some ways is positive for this discussion in that they recognize that overspending, overtaxing are challenges for the 
country
. The same is true when you look back at the 
Clinton
 years. He realized that as well. There are smart, sensible people in both parties. As long as you don't allow the 
far left
 and the far right, again, to crowd out the, the, the predominant middle, we can get a lot of this done. If that means making tough choices on 
Social Security
 -- I'm 40, I'm 
willing
 to give mine up, and I think a lot of people my age who may reach a certain 
income
 level are 
willing
 to do the same. But 
political leaders
 have to show some courage and will to make it happen.
"
403,"
MR. GREGORY:
I had, I had no idea you were that old. Newt -- Speaker 
Gingrich
, do you think this president has the political stroke that 
Bill Clinton
 did to actually forge a consensus on tough choices?
"
404,"
REP. GINGRICH:
I have no idea. I was a 
little
 disappointed in Mr. 
Axelrod
's comments this morning. But it took, it took 
President Clinton
 eight months from the time we won in November to his decision in June of '95 to work with us. I mean, 
change
 on this scale is very wrenching, and it's wrenching for his staff, it's wrenching for his allies. Frankly, I think 
Speaker Pelosi
 becoming the minority leader will make it harder. So I, I don't, I, I don't know what the president will do. What I do -- the only place I worry about in terms of the kind of riots you were showing is not 
Americans
 in 
general
. I believe the scale of 
change
 coming to 
government
 workers is going to be so great that you may well see, in places like 
Sacramento
 or 
Albany
, 
New York
, very serious unrest by union members who are offended at the idea that they should actually earn in proportion to the taxpayer and not be the new special class in 
America
, which is what they've become over the last 20 years.
"
405,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me get to the issue of 
tax cuts
 to both of you, 
Bethany
 and Dr. 
Greenspan
. Dr. 
Greenspan
, we talked about this issue before, are 
tax cuts
 paid for? Or, to put it a different way, should the 
tax cuts
 on wealthier 
Americans
 be extended without corresponding spending cuts? What's going to happen? What should happen?
"
406,"
DR. GREENSPAN:
Well, what's going to happen is that they're going to get extended. I mean, that's very obvious, irrespective of what the rhetoric is, because that's the easiest thing to do politically at this stage. But we have to recognize that, longer term, the 
problem
 is spending. You can't think about the concept of 
taxes
 until you ask, what is it that you're funding? At the moment, we are essentially borrowing more than a third of what we spend, and this is causing a huge increase in the debt, and it's not going to be easily reversed. Look, as far as I'm concerned, what we're going to have to do is to essentially look at, not individual, piecemeal cuts or 
taxes
, we have to look at whole projects. I mean, for example, I happen to think 
Paul Ryan
 did a very important -- was -- made, made a very important contribution...
"
407,"
MR. GREGORY:
He's going to be chairman of the 
Budget Committee
 in the new 
Republican House
.
"
408,"
DR. GREENSPAN:
Yeah. Now, you can 
agree
 or disagree with his whole structure. I happen to 
agree
 with almost all of it.
"
409,"
MR. GREGORY:

Draconian
 cuts in 
Medicare
 and other programs.
"
410,"
DR. GREENSPAN:
Yeah. But the 
problem
 here is that you're going to have to vote an up or down 
budget
 each time. In other words, all of these budgets that are going to come up are going to be compromises. You can't do it piecemeal. And then the very fascinating question is how -- 
and I
 ask my colleagues across the table here -- how does the 
Congress
 deal with that sort of thing when the committees and the 
committee
 chairmen and the committees which have jurisdiction for all various aspects of the 
budget
, are going to insist upon wanting to get into the middle of it?
"
411,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, let me get 
Bethany
 on the 
tax cut
 issue here, whether this is actually going to move 
forward
 or only on a temporary basis.
"
412,"
MS. McLEAN:
Well, I have to say I hope it does because I think if you look at 
economic history
, the 
Bush tax cuts
 didn't put our 
economy
 on a sound footing. The 
Obama
 spending didn't put our 
economy
 on a sound footing. Since neither one has worked, let's try, let's try some of both. My big fear is that, is that we don't have as much time as 
Washington
 seems to think we have. 
And I
 say that because smart -- the 
smart money
 on 
Wall Street
 has been talking about a 
sovereign debt
 crisis for a couple of years now, even before we had the conflagration in 
Greece
.
"
413,"
MR. GREGORY:
And what does that mean?
"
414,"
MS. McLEAN:
And -- that, that, that means that we're going to have this 
bond market
 crisis that Dr. 
Greenspan
 was talking about earlier sooner than we may expect. 
And I
 worry that we have less time to fix this 
problem
 and less time to get our 
house
 in order than, than people seem to think.
"
415,"
MR. GREGORY:
What happens -- an indulgence in an area that I spend time thinking about -- if, if the 
big government
 companies, 
Fannie Mae
 and, and 
Freddie Mac
, taken over by the 
government
, if they guarantee 95 percent of the mortgage debt, there is no 
market
 now for mortgages, and the 
government
 says, ""Well, we got to wind these things down."" What's going to happen here with the mortgage 
market
?
"
416,"
MS. McLEAN:
Two alternatives. Either the private 
market
 does step up -- and the case that some people argue, which is that the 
Fannie
 and 
Freddie
 are crowding out the private 
market
, comes to the fore and the private 
market
 steps up and we're fine. Or we have a huge collapse in housing.
"
417,"
MR. GREGORY:
You worry, Dr. 
Greenspan
, about propping up the 
housing market
.
"
418,"
DR. GREENSPAN:
Well, let me just say this, that unless the 
housing market
 begins to move back, we're not going to have any significant cuts in the 
unemployment rate
 generally. But at the moment, 
housing starts
 are as low as they can get and really just replace the number of units we need.
"
419,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
420,"
DR. GREENSPAN:
So that there's a question not of the 
housing market
 going down more, the key question here is the price of homes. Because what we saw, for example, in 
2005
, 
2006
, is there were something like eight million new home purchases financed by conventional conforming mortgages, which means 20 percent down, and the like. That eight million -- those eight million homes are now 
right on the edge
 of being so-called ""underwater."" And while the 
price levels
 of homes have been remarkably stable since the beginning of this year, the critical issue is that if they tilt below where they are now, say 5 or 10 percent, it's going to create a major increase in foreclosures...
"
421,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right.
"
422,"
DR. GREENSPAN:
...with 
problems
.
"
423,"
MR. GREGORY:
We're going to take a break here, come back with a last couple of minutes, talk a 
little
 politics before we close out the program. Back in just a moment.
"
424,"

"
425,"
MR. GREGORY:
Back with a couple of closing thoughts. Speaker 
Gingrich
, somebody made a smart point the other day, said, ""You know what, 
Newt Gingrich
 will be the first to announce for president. He'll do it in January in 
Iowa
."" Where are you? You going to run?
"
426,"
REP. FORD:
I'm leaning back for you.
"
427,"
REP. GINGRICH:
How's that? It's like you and the 
Senate
 race last year. No, I, I think 
Callista
 and I'll make a decision probably in February; and probably, if we do run, we'll announce, I suspect, in late March. But we're still months away from that.
"
428,"
MR. GREGORY:
What's going into your thinking on that?
"
429,"
REP. GINGRICH:
I think partially can you create a movement that really wants to get to fundamental 
change
 and can you make that bigger than the presidency. I don't you can solve 
problems
 in a 
country
 of 513,000 elected officials by focusing only on the 
Oval Office
.
"
430,"
MR. GREGORY:
Do you really think the president's vulnerable in 
2012
?
"
431,"
REP. GINGRICH:
Sure. I mean -- but he's not, he's not, he's not beaten. The -- this president has enormous capacity to recover. I think the 
economy
 will actually get marginally better over the next year, and he and the 
House
 Republicans will fight over who did it. But I suspect he'll -- we'll be at closer to 8 percent than to 10 percent unemployment in '12.
"
432,"
MR. GREGORY:
But the 
Republicans
 I talk to say that 
Sarah Palin
 and the 
tea party
 have created a whole new dynamic on the 
Republican side
. It is impossible to say who's got an early edge. What is the impact?
"
433,"
REP. GINGRICH:
Yes. I think that's exactly right, and I think it's like all the races we saw this year. You will not know who the nominee is until very late in the spring of, of 
2012
 because Governor 
Palin
 has a role, Governor 
Huckabee
 has a role, Governor 
Romney
 has a role, you know, Governor 
Daniels
. I mean, go down the list, Governor 
Pawlenty
, Governor 
Barbour
. I mean, you could have 12 or 15 candidates out there early next year, and you won't know how the conversation leads to a decision until it actually happens.
"
434,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm. All right. Well, we're going to leave it there. Thank you all very much for joining us today. You can read an excerpt, by the way, of

MR. GREGORY:
Good morning. Breaking news in 
The New York Times
 this morning that 
North Korea
 has built a large 
nuclear facility
 to enrich uranium. An American 
nuclear scientist
 who visited the site telling the 
Times
 he was ""stunned"" by the sophistication of this new plant. This further complicates the president's 
nuclear disarmament
 agenda from 
North Korea
 to 
Russia
 to 
Iran
, which was front and 
center
 at the 
NATO summit
 in 
Portugal
, as the president used the 
world
 stage to press his Republican opponents in 
Congress
 to ratify a new 
nuclear arms
 deal with 
Russia
. 
Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton
 was with the president at the 
summit
, and I spoke with her before she departed 
Lisbon
. Secretary 
Clinton
, welcome back to the program.
"

SEC'Y HILLARY CLINTON:

Thank you very much
, 
David
.
"
9,"
MR. GREGORY:
I want to talk about this showdown between the president and 
Senate
 Republicans over the 
START treaty
. The president, in his comments to reporters, made it very clear he thinks politics is being played here, saying to reporters, ""Nobody's going to score any 
political
 points to 
2012
."" Is that the president's belief here about what's standing in the way? And in your view, is this really a, a litmus test of whether there can be bipartisanship in 
Washington
 after the 
election
?
"
10,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
Well, I think the president believes strongly, and I agree with him, that this 
treaty
 is in the 
national security
 interest of the 
United States
. And it's not only 
Americans
 who believe that. I'm, you know, very impressed by the 
number
 of leaders at the 
NATO Lisbon
summit
 who voluntarily told their own press, or American press, they were chasing down reporters to say this is so much in the interest of 
Europe
 and others. So the president sees this very clearly. But I don't think he considers this a 
political
 issue. It's a question of whether we have the time and whether we can make the case in the limited time that the lame duck provides to satisfy the concerns of two-thirds of the 
Senate
. I think we can. I think that everyone has operated in good faith. We have looked hard at this. When it came out of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
, it came out with an overwhelming bipartisan vote, 14-to-4. I think that the questions are being -- that are being asked by 
Republicans
 deserve thoughtful answers. And everyone in the 
administration
 stands ready, from 
Bob Gates
 to 
Jim Clapper
, the head of the -- 
director of national intelligence
, because we all see it in the same way. And we're in the tradition of both Republican and 
Democratic presidents
, going back to 
Ronald Reagan
, who famously said, ""Trust, but verify."" We have no verification without a 
treaty
 about what's going on in 
Russia
's 
nuclear program
. So I think whether you're, you know, already convinced or can be convinced, I think we want to get our inspectors back on the ground, and the only way to do that is by ratifying this 
treaty
.
"
11,"
MR. GREGORY:
Is there an issue, though, of American prestige? The president was dealt a setback on 
fair trade
 when he was in 
Seoul.
 There was a feeling, when it comes to whether it's trade or 
economic policy
, that 
America
 can't always get what it wants. Is this going to potentially be a problem of the president not being able to get what he wants on the 
world
 stage because of 
Republicans
?
"
12,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
Well, first of all, I think that the president didn't agree to a trade deal in 
Seoul
 because he didn't feel like it was enough in 
America
's interest. 
That's what
 a president is supposed to do. Obviously, he's still working to get one finalized that is. And in respect to 
START
, which concerns, not just trade, but 
life or death
, because we're talking about thousands of 
nuclear warheads
 that are still pointed at the 
United States
, the president believes this does go beyond politics. You can argue about a trade deal, but what the tradition has been in the 
Senate
, going back to the 
1980s
 with 
President Reagan
, is that once people have had a chance to carefully consider these arms control treaties, they have been passed overwhelmingly. We've seen it with the 
Reagan
 and the 
Bush
 administrations, the 
Clinton administration
. Now, of course...
"
13,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
14,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
...we are in the 
Obama
administration
. And in this one area, this goes beyond politics. This should be nonpartisan, not just bipartisan.
"
15,"
MR. GREGORY:
Secretary 
Clinton
, let me get to a few other areas, including the war in 
Afghanistan
. Listening to the president, listening and following the events that have happened at the 
NATO summit
, I wonder whether the 
Washington
 clock for the war has changed, and that 
Americans
 should expect that by next July there's a token 
number
 of 
U.S. forces
 that are withdrawn, and that, really, the war doesn't end for American until 
2014
.
"
16,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
No, 
David
, I think that we've been very clear about this, that the transition to Afghan 
security
 lead begins next year in 
2011
. It is conditions-based. So where it can happen, at what pace it can happen, how many troops can be substituted for, that is what 
General Petraeus
 and the 
military
 leaders are going to be working on to recommend to the president and the leaders of other countries.
"
17,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, let me get in on a key point, then. Is it possible then, even at 
2014
, when you envision and you hope that a transition is complete, might the 
United States
 have a long-term presence there, say, in the form of permanent air bases, to maintain a presence in the 
country
?
"
18,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
Well, we're, we're intent upon reaching the goal of transitioning to Afghan 
security
 in 
2014
. But both the 
United States
 and 
NATO-ISAF
 partners have said that, of course, we'd be 
willing
 to help train and equip the 
Afghan military
, what we do with countries around the 
world
. There could be other missions that other countries would take on in terms of 
civilian
 aid and supporting the 
government
. So the 
security
 lead, the, the fight, if you will, does transition to the Afghans. 
Support
 for that fight will continue to be provided by...
"
19,"
MR. GREGORY:
What, what about...
"
20,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
...not just the 
United States
, but others.
"
21,"
MR. GREGORY:
...permanent bases? Permanent bases?
"
22,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
There's, there's been no decision whatsoever about any of that.
"
23,"
MR. GREGORY:
But is that possible? Is that something that the 
U.S.
 is considering?
"
24,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
There's no consideration. It's just not on the table at this point.
"
25,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me ask you about -- as secretary of 
State
, you don't have to deal with 
airport security
, but so many 
Americans
 do, especially coming up in this 
Thanksgiving
 week.
"
26,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
Right. Right.
"
27,"
MR. GREGORY:
There's obviously a 
security
threat
 out there...
"
28,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
Right.
"
29,"
MR. GREGORY:
...a terror 
threat
, which is why you have this advanced technology and why you have these rather invasive pat-downs that we're seeing throughout airports around the 
country
. Is this excessive, or is this the right 
response
 to the kind of 
threat
 environment that 
Americans
 face?
"
30,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
Well, the people responsible for our 
security
, such as Secretary 
Napolitano
, obviously believe that this is necessary. 
And I
'm not going to comment or certainly second-guess their considered opinions. At the same time, I think everyone, including our 
security experts
, are looking for ways to diminish the impact on the traveling public. I mean, obviously the vast, vast majority of people getting on these planes are law-abiding citizens who are just trying to get from, you know, one place to another. But let's not kid ourselves. The 
terrorists
 are adaptable, they start doing whatever they can to try to cause harm. And when you have people who are 
willing
 to die in order to kill 
Americans
 and others -- you've got folks putting explosives in their underwear, who would have thought that? So striking the right balance is what this is about. 
And I
 am absolutely confident that our 
security experts
 are going to keep trying to get it better and less intrusive and more precise. But at the same time, we want people to travel safely.
"
31,"
MR. GREGORY:
And a follow-up on, on 
terrorism
. The 
Ahmed Ghailani
 case that was concluded this week with a conviction has raised new questions about whether it's wise to put these terror suspects in 
civilian
courts
. As secretary of 
State
, why is it important to the 
rest of the world
 that these hardened terror suspects go in 
U.S.
civilian
courts
 to be tried?
"
32,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
Well, I think it's important, first and foremost, to 
Americans
, which is my highest priority, what, what is best for the 
United States
 and for our own citizens. The 
civilian
courts
, known as 
Article III
courts
 under the 
Constitution
, have a good track record of convicting 
terrorists
. And, in fact, if you look at the comparison between 
terrorists
 who are now serving time in our 
maximum security
 prisons compared to what 
military commissions
 have been able to do, there's no comparison. We get convictions, we send people away in our 
civilian
courts
 at a much more regularized and predictable way than yet we've been able to figure out how in the 
military commissions
. Secondly, I think there's a misconception in our own 
country
 about what's admissible in terms of evidence in a 
civilian
 court vs. a 
military commission
. They don't have the same 
rules
, but the 
rules
 are close enough in terms of what can or can't be admitted into evidence. So there's a, there's a very strong argument that what the judge in the 
Ghailani
 case said...
"
33,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
34,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
...could not be admitted, would not have been admissible, either...
"
35,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, right, and that's kind of...
"
36,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
...in a 
military commission
.
"
37,"
MR. GREGORY:
And that's a very narrow issue, but the real issue is there's a lot of uncertainty in the 
criminal justice system
, as you well know, as a lawyer...
"
38,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
But there -- but...
"
39,"
MR. GREGORY:
...and in a 
civilian
 case. But my question is, are we committed with these terror suspects that if they are acquitted in 
civilian
courts
, they should be released?
"
40,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
Well, no. And don't forget, we're not going to...
"
41,"
MR. GREGORY:
Then why -- but then why hold up the 
American system
...
"
42,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
But...
"
43,"
MR. GREGORY:
...as the right route if you're not going to release them? 
That's what
 the 
American system
 says you have to do.
"
44,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
But, 
David
, first of all, our system is the best system in the 
world
. We all know that. It is good enough and strong enough to either convict and sentence the guilty or even execute, where appropriate, and, where you can't convince an American jury, which is certainly obsessed with 
terrorism
, maybe there's a question about the strength of the case. 
And I
 think what we are trying to do is get the best result consistent with our laws and 
Constitution
. And under our laws, 
military commissions
 are legal for certain cases, but it should be the 
primary
 decision to use our 
civilian
courts
 whenever and wherever possible. So I, I think that this has become a kind of strange argument. On the one hand, people say we want to convict these people. The 
civilian
courts
 have a better record of actually convicting and imprisoning than we do yet have in the 
military commission
. But we also don't want to have 
security
 problems or publicity problems for particularly dangerous leading 
terrorists
, so we should look at the 
military commission
. So I, I think that this is a difficult issue, but I really hope that everyone can look at it carefully and consider all of the facts concerning this.
"
45,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. Secretary 
Clinton
, before I let you go, I have to ask you this, just as a 
political
 observer, what do you make of what happened on 
Election Day
? And all this talk about 
Sarah Palin
, when I interviewed you a while back, you said you'd be 
willing
 to sit down and have coffee with her. She may be someone who is in a position to try to equal what you accomplished in the 
political
 arena. What, what advice might you give her? And what do you make of what's happened politically?
"
46,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
You know, 
David
, the best thing about being secretary of 
State
 is representing the 
United States
 around the 
world
, but the second best thing is I'm out of politics. So, with all due respect, I am not going to comment on the 
political
 scene right now, other than to say that I'm focused on making the case to 67 plus senators in the 
Senate
 to pass the 
START treaty
 because that's, to me, the, the most important task facing the 
Senate
, and it goes way beyond politics.
"
47,"
MR. GREGORY:
And here I thought I'd lulled you into a moment of candor. Secretary 
Clinton
, 
thank you very much
, as always.
"
48,"
SEC'Y CLINTON:
Thank you, 
David
.
"
49,"
MR. GREGORY:
We now turn to the author of the new book ""Leadership and Crisis,"" Republican governor of 
Louisiana
, 
Bobby Jindal
. Governor, welcome back to the program. When we talk about politics, you're going to have to answer all the questions.
"
50,"
GOV. BOBBY JINDAL (R-LA):

Well...

"
51,"
MR. GREGORY:
You can't wiggle out. You can't use the secretary of 
State
 argument on. I'm just putting you on notice.
"
52,"
GOV. JINDAL:

That's right
. That's not my job. Thank you for having me back.
"
53,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right.
"
54,"
GOV. JINDAL:
It's great to be back.
"
55,"
MR. GREGORY:
I, I want to talk, because your book deals a lot with the issue of the role of 
government
. And we'll talk about the 
gulf oil
 spill in just a moment. But let me pick up on an area that I asked Secretary 
Clinton
 about, the 
TSA
, these 
airport screeners
 and some of these searches that are really disturbing people around the 
country
, is this excessive?
"
56,"
GOV. JINDAL:
Absolutely. Now, look, let's start off, we cannot be lackadaisical about protecting our 
country
 against 
terrorists
, make no mistake about that. But I've got two 
primary
 concerns with how they're doing this. First, 
George Will
, 
Charles Krauthammer
, others have made this point...
"
57,"
MR. GREGORY:
Conservative columnists.
"
58,"
GOV. JINDAL:
Other conservative columnists have made this point; they're not using common sense, they're not using intelligence. Look, there's no reason for them to be doing these body searches of six-year-old, 12-year-old girls traveling from 
Louisiana
 to visit their grandparents. We're not talking about 
profiling
, but use the information to actually -- don't let 
political correctness
 stop them. Use the information we have to actually apply our defenses to those most likely to cause us harm. But here's the second concern. It feels too much, from this 
administration
, like we're playing a defensive game in the 
war on terrorism
. Yes, we need to harden our infrastructure, but if you have a committed terrorist who's 
willing
 to give up their lives, you look at that past pattern. We got 
lucky
 with the bomb in 
Times Square
, we got 
lucky
 with the cargo packages, we got 
lucky
 with the underwear bomber that the devices didn't go off. Luck is not a strategy. We need to be rooting out these networks, we need to be killing these 
terrorists
. I think that the 
American people
 are worried when they see an 
administration
 worried about reading 
Miranda rights
 to the underwear bomber. They worry when they see an 
administration
 committed to 
civilian
 trials. They wonder, ""You're so worried about the rights of the 
terrorists
, what about the rights of the innocent 
American traveler
?"" So, absolutely, I'm concerned that out of 
political correctness
, they're screening people they don't really believe to be dangerous.
"
59,"
MR. GREGORY:
So you think 
profiling
 is really a better option.
"
60,"
GOV. JINDAL:
I don't think it's 
profiling
. I think it's using the information we know. You look at things like, for example, you look at travel patterns, you look at how they purchase their 
ticket
, you look at the information, the intel we've got. We all know -- and again, 
George Will
 and others make this point so articulately -- we all know that the grandmother who's being, being body searched doesn't really pose the 
threat
. We know the 
little girl
 going to visit her grandmother -- here's the third thing that is also odd. The 
administration
 rolled this out right before the busiest travel time of the entire year, never making their case to the American public. If they really believed this was a 
response
 to a genuine 
threat
, why didn't they make their case to the American public? The 
bottom line
 is, yes, we need to secure our 
country
, but simply playing 
defense
 isn't enough.
"
61,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, let me...
"
62,"
GOV. JINDAL:
Yes, we need to harden our infrastructure.
"
63,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
64,"
GOV. JINDAL:
But I think that it's hard to, to listen to an 
administration
 that's reading the 
Miranda rights
, stopping the interrogation of the underwear bomber. And it's so hard to 
understand
, why are they so worried about the terrorist's rights and now our rights?
"
65,"
MR. GREGORY:
You know, you, you write about this in your book, and I want to put a portion of it out the way you talk about a therapeutic 
foreign policy
. We'll get that portion of your book and put it on the screen. You write that ""Our current therapeutic approach to 
national security
 is dangerous. I'm just not interested in empathizing with the 'grievances' of our sworn enemies. Let's figure out where they're vulnerable and destroy them."" And hearing what you just said, I think a lot of people would hear that and say, ""Is that a serious commentary?"" I mean, you keep mentioning the 
Christmas Day
 bomber, who actually confessed to what he was doing; and the 
Miranda rights
 were not read until later, 
number
 one. How could you say that this 
administration
, which has so many areas of continuity and is more robust in targeting 
terrorists
 in 
Pakistan
, surging up forces in 
Afghanistan
, a continuity with regard to treatment of, of terror suspects and detainees, how could this be a therapeutic approach to 
foreign policy
 and 
national security
?
"
66,"
GOV. JINDAL:
Well, three things. One, I think the 
Bush administration
 was also wrong, by the way, the way they treated 
Richard Reid
, the, the 
shoe bomber
. I, I don't just criticize this president, I criticize 
President Bush
.
"
67,"
MR. GREGORY:
So you think 
President Bush
 just got 
lucky
?
"
68,"
GOV. JINDAL:
No. I...
"
69,"
MR. GREGORY:
When there was no strike after -- well, how does 
Obama
 just get 
lucky
, but 
President Bush
 is better?
"
70,"
GOV. JINDAL:
Wait a minute. Let me answer your question. First, I think he was wrong and the 
administration
 was wrong in the way they approached that bomber in the same way. I mean, go back to the 
Miranda rights
 for the, the underwear bomber. What evidence do they need? He -- I mean, they caught him with the device. What was the purpose? You asked a great question to
"
71,"
Secretary Clinton:
Why are we doing these 
civilian
 trials if they're not going to release them? Why are we compromising sources? But here's the second point. You look at some of 
President Obama
's writings. You look at how he talks about, ""Well, we need to 
understand
 the, the disadvantaged backgrounds. This is a matter of 
social justice
 and more 
foreign aid
."" Nonsense. The analysts have looked at the 
terrorists
 that are coming at us. A -- the disproportionate share are educated, come from privileged backgrounds. The reality is, this isn't about people who don't have enough jobs, who don't have enough social aid. This is about fighting an enemy that hates our 
way of life
. This is a fundamental clash of cultures. 
And I
 think that it's important to the 
war on terrorism
 that we 
understand
 what's at stake. This isn't, ""Well, let's go and figure out a way to apologize for 
America
."" This isn't, ""Have we offended them because we're supporting 
Israel
?"" I think our 
foreign policy
 needs to be based around the understanding this is an enemy that hates our -- and disagrees with our fundamental freedoms.
"
72,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let's, let's bring it back home. 
Let's talk
 about your book, ""Leadership in 
Crisis
."" Here's some video back in May of you having a pretty heated discussion with the president. And we don't have to relitigate the whole issue there. It had to do with expanding 
food stamp
 assistance for those affected by the spill. He was concerned about a letter that you had sent out and some of the timing issues, but you make a larger point as a result of that discussion, and, and you write about it in the book. ""That encounter with 
President Obama
 served as a reminder to me of why 
Americans

"
73,"
are so frustrated with Washington:
the feds 
focus
 on the wrong things. 
Political
 posturing becomes more important than reality. In 
Washington
 they
"
74,"
live by the motto:
'Perception is reality.' They worry about things they shouldn't and fail to do things that they should 
focus
 on. It's called core competence, or lack thereof."" Was the 
administration
 incompetent in dealing with the 
gulf oil
 spill?
"
75,"
GOV. JINDAL:
Absolutely. And look, that whole conversation, and even in their 
response
 to the book, the 
administration
 doesn't get it. They were mad -- he was mad about 
food stamps
. The point was two weeks after the explosion, the, the main issue wasn't 
food stamps
. We were frustrated by the lack of 
resources
, lack of a plan. I write in the book, for example, that there was literally one case, oil coming into 
Timbalier Bay
. There's boom, there, there are 
resources
, there are people, there are boats sitting on the dock in 
Cocodrie
. I take the 
federal government
 official in charge of the 
response
 to 
Louisiana
 by 
Black Hawk helicopter
 so he can see the oil, thinking, of course, we'll get a 
response
 now. When he sees the oil, he admits there's oil, he admits the 
resources
 there. He tells me, because of the bureaucracy, it'll take 24 to 
48 hours
 to move those 
resources
, get them mobilized. That's too late.
"
76,"
A second instance, we have a locally devised solution:
vacuum barges to pick up the oil out of the water. The 
federal government
 shuts it down for over 
24 hours
 so they can check the valves, so they can count the 
number
 of 
life jackets
 and fire extinguishers, so they can do routine inspections. After being embarrassed publicly, 
24 hours
 later they admit, ""We don't need to do the inspections."" But they waste that time in the meantime. Look, the 
White House
 comes back in 
response
 to the book and says, ""Well, we talked to the governor every day."" It wasn't access. We had access. We had plenty of access. It was not getting timely action. 
You and I
 were talking about the bureaucracy, the 
red tape
. Fake five years ago, in the 
federal response
 to 
Katrina
, we saw some of the same impediments again, in 
response
 to the 
oil spill
. At one point, we pointed out there was boom, there was materials all over the 
country
 sitting in warehouses and facilities. It took too long to relax the regulations to move those 
resources
 to the 
gulf coast
. That would be like fighting a war, running out of ammunition on the front lines, having ammunition sitting in the warehouses because that's what the 
rules
 say. They didn't cut through the 
red tape
 and bureaucracy. They didn't always realize what were the most important things to get done.
"
77,"
MR. GREGORY:

The White House
 has struck back pretty hard at this. You know, one of the things you talk about is being more concerned with the 
PR
 strategy, and yet, look at the cover at this book, ""Leadership in 
Crisis
."" I mean, you know, you've got a picture of you in, in 
response
 to the 
gulf oil
 spill. This could be certainly seen as a way to, to shore up your own 
political
 standing and use your own 
PR
. And the 
White House
 says this, this is a statement they provided to us about some of the substance in the book. I'll put it on the screen. ""The governor requested the 
national guard
, we approved and he never put them to work. Governor 
Jindal
 pushed for his 
berms
,"" those sand 
berms
, we can talk more in just minute, ""which everyone has agreed were a mistake. Governor 
Jindal
 said that we didn't have a plan for skimmers"" and ""or boom, when he knows perfectly well that we did, [
National Incident Commander Adm
.] 
Thad Allen
 described it to him countless times, and Gov. 
Jindal
's own office approved the plans. He got a daily update on the status of skimmers and boom from the 
Coast Guard
 in advance of the daily call."" There's nothing, ""this is nothing more than trying to sell a book.""
"
78,"
GOV. JINDAL:
Well, look, the first meeting, he comes on, he tips off the 
Washington
 reporter, ""Watch this interaction."" He tells them, ""I'm going to be mad with the governor.""
"
79,"
MR. GREGORY:
You see -- the president, you're saying.
"
80,"
GOV. JINDAL:
The president, the, the 
White House
, I'm not sure he actually called all those reporters up and said, ""Watch this."" The second time he comes down to 
Louisiana
, at the end of the second meeting -- we have a meeting with parish presidents, other 
elected officials
. The end of the second meeting, he turns to me and 
Billy Nungesser
, parish -- president of 
Plaquemines Parish
, and says, ""
And I
 don't want you guys going on 
TV
 to criticize me."" This is the president of the 
United States
, and he's more worried not about, ""Guys, here's the plan. 
Here's how
 we're going to fight the oil."" Here was the problem, and you look again at the 
response
. Yeah, we talked to him every day, but the, the frustration was actually getting a 
response
, actually getting them to move the assets on the ground. 
Time and time again
, they wouldn't listen to local fishermen. They wouldn't listen to people who lived down there, who know those waters like the back of their hands. From the beginning, they continued to be over reliant on the experts from 
BP
 and others. They underestimated the 
threat
. You know, you remember the first several days, there's no...
"
81,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
82,"
GOV. JINDAL:
...oil. Then it's a thousand barrels.
"
83,"
MR. GREGORY:
But what about your role, Governor. I mean, your big issue is pushing to build this, this chain of sand 
berms
 to get the oil to stop coming ashore. By all accounts, it had a negligible effect, at best.
"
84,"
GOV. JINDAL:
Well, that, that's not true, 
David
. We were very pleased. Two things about the sand 
berms
. We've now built over 12 miles, and this is going to be the largest coastal 
island restoration
 project in our 
state
's history, which is something, by the way, that is good for our coast, independent of the 
oil spill
, good to protect us against hurricane surge as well as 
oil spill
. We've collected thousands of pounds of oily debris off these 
berms
. We have been able to stop oil both on the surface and submerged oil. And here's the third thing, if they hadn't slowed us down, they took almost a month to approve the permits. Even after they approved the permits, they wouldn't allow us to dredge the sand from the areas they had already approved. We could have built many more miles. The sand 
berms
 were a great success, but here's -- this is another great example. They weren't 
willing
 to 
think outside the box
. The 
federal government
 themselves approved. The 
US Corps
 of 
Engineers
 said the positives outweigh the negatives. The -- 
Admiral Allen
 and the president both intervened to approve six of those segments. They themselves -- this was a preapproved 
Coast Guard
response
 to an 
oil spill
, very effective. We are thrilled we did those sand 
berms
.
"
85,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. Well, scientists will disagree with that, but we'll...
"
86,"
GOV. JINDAL:
Not every scientist. Now wait a minute, the, the -- it -- 
let's not
 say that everybody disagrees. There are scientists that absolutely say this was 
one of the best
 things we could do for coast. Now that we've convinced 
BP
 not to just make them temporary 
berms
, but to convert them into coastal islands, the, the restoration of what was the original footprint, there are many scientists who have praised this as one of the most significant steps forward.
"
87,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. Let me ask you a 
bottom line
 question. 
Haley Barbour
, the governor of 
Mississippi
, somebody who's, who's been a mentor to you, a very important Republican figure, he said on this program back in June, the 
federal government
's done more right than wrong. What do you know that he doesn't know? What have you seen that he didn't see assessing the situation?
"
88,"
GOV. JINDAL:
Well, you go back, you go back to that day. 
Louisiana
 at that point had -- it continued to bear the brunt of the oil coming in to our coast, and our frustration was, again, when we wanted 
resources
, they weren't there. When their 
resources
 weren't available, we came up with solutions, like jack up barges to make the boom last longer so we could deploy it in 
real time
. It literally -- it took meetings with the president of the 
United States
 to cut through the bureaucracy to get that done. And they 
wasted time
 in the meantime.
"
89,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
90,"
GOV. JINDAL:
We wanted solutions like using hard pipe to deflect oil. It took too long for them. What we basically said was, ""If you don't have the 
resources
, 
let us
 protect our own coast. At least, either lead or get out of the way."" And the problem was, either they didn't provide the 
resources
, then when we tried, they interfered with our efforts.
"
91,"
MR. GREGORY:
Just a minute left here. Some politics questions here. Do you think the president's a one-term president?
"
92,"
GOV. JINDAL:
I think it's up to him. I think the voters said a couple of weeks ago they want to see less deficits, less spending, $14 trillion and counting is too much. The 
government
 24 percent of 
GDP
 is too high. They don't want this 
administration
 to 
focus
 on 
Obamacare
, cap and trade, card check. They want this 
administration
 and 
Congress
 focused on getting the 
private sector
economy
 running and growing again.
"
93,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
94,"
GOV. JINDAL:
If he changes direction, he can certainly make a, a stronger case. But if he stays, if he doubles down on his current path, I think it's going to be very hard to make the case two years from now that he deserves to be re-elected.
"
95,"
MR. GREGORY:
You don't want to be president in 
2012
?
"
96,"
GOV. JINDAL:
No. You've got the tape from me last time.
"
97,"
MR. GREGORY:
I do. You, would you be on a 
ticket
? Would you be a 
number
 two?
"
98,"
GOV. JINDAL:
Look, I'm running for re-
election
 in 
2011
. I'm running to be the governor of 
Louisiana
. There will be other candidates running for president and vice president.
"
99,"
MR. GREGORY:
Would you rule out, rule out being a 
number
 two on a 
ticket
?
"
100,"
GOV. JINDAL:
I'm not going to turn down something that's not been offered to me.
"
101,"
MR. GREGORY:
OK.
"
102,"
GOV. JINDAL:
But I'm not running for vice president. I'm, I'm...
"
103,"
MR. GREGORY:
Would you like to be president some day?
"
104,"
GOV. JINDAL:
I, look, my only 
political
 aspiration is to be re-elected governor for a second term. We've cut spending in 
Louisiana
. 
Portfolio.com
 says we've got the second best economic performance in the 
country
. We're not 
raising taxes
.
"
105,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah.
"
106,"
GOV. JINDAL:
I think we can prove a great example in 
Louisiana
 of what 
Washington
 should be doing instead of borrowing and printing more money.
"
107,"
MR. GREGORY:

Sarah Palin
 gets a great deal of attention as a movement conservative. Can she unite the 
Republican Party
 and actually be the nominee?
"
108,"
GOV. JINDAL:
I think she can make a compelling case. I think there's several governors, former governors, and others.
"
109,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
110,"
GOV. JINDAL:
My bias is, and I've said this before, I like governors because they have to balance their budgets, they have to run their 
states
. They actually have to, to...
"
111,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right. Well, she, she was a governor. But the question is, I'm sure she could make a compelling case, but do you think she can unify the party and actually get the nomination, as you survey the landscape?
"
112,"
GOV. JINDAL:
I -- look, I'll leave it to the pundits. I'm sure she can. But I'm sure there are a lot of other candidates. I think there's such a 
focus
 on the messengers, what's more important is the message. The 
Republican Party
, 
Karl Rove
 says we're on probation. He's right. We're on 
borrowed time
. Four years ago we blew it because we defended -- the 
Republican Party
 defended earmarks and spending we would never accept. Now the 
Republicans
, I'm glad they've shifted their position on earmarks. They've got to cut nondefense 
discretionary spending
. We've got to show in the next two years we're worthy of being a 
majority party
 by cutting spending back to historic norms, cutting 
taxes
, getting the 
private sector
economy
 growing. Let the pundits figure out who's running in 
2012
, who the nominee is going to be, who the 
RNC
 chair is going to be. What's more important for us is to show the 
American people
 we've learned our lessons, we deserve to be a 
majority party
 again.
"
113,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. We'll leave it there. Governor, 
thank you very much
.
"
114,"
GOV. JINDAL:

David
, thank you for having me.

115,"
MR. GREGORY:

GOV. JINDAL:

MR. GREGORY:
Yeah. There you go. Up next, growing controversy over new 
airport security
rules

We are back with our

 now. Joining me, 
editorial page
 editor of 
The Wall Street Journal
, 
Paul Gigot
; contributing writer for 
The New York Times Magazine
, 
Robert Draper
 -- his piece is out today on 
Sarah Palin
, the 
cover story
 of 
The New York Times Magazine
 -- and the author of the new book ""Revival"" is with us, ""
The Struggle
 for 
Survival Inside
 the 
Obama White House
,"" 
Richard Wolffe
; as well as incoming congressman from 
Florida
, Republican 
Allen West
. Welcome to all of you. Congressman, let me start with you. I mean, a, a fellow Republican, Governor 
Jindal
, talking about the searches that we've seen around the 
country
. And remember as we look at some of this video that a lot of people think it's disturbing. These are people who are making a choice not to go through the actual machines that provide a rather revealing look at, at, at our bodies. And if they don't do that, they, they get these pat-downs. You heard him say clearly, ""excessive."" Is this going to become a bigger issue in 
Washington
?
"
123,"
REP.-ELECT ALLEN WEST (R-FL):
I think it may end up becoming an issue, especially when we come out of this holiday season and we see how that affects us -- the travel and the, and the 
economy
. But I think, once again, it comes back to marketing. I mean, we should have put out some type of feelers and talked to the 
American people
 about this before we go and implement this type of plan. And also, when you go back, you look at after 
September 11th
, we had the 
opportunity
 with 
Israel
 coming and talking to us about improving our 
security screening
 procedures, and we turned them down. I traveled to 
Israel
, and I tell you what, they have very good procedures, and you don't have to go through all of these very 
Draconian
 practices.
"
124,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah. Well, this is the, this is the debate, 
Richard
. I mean, it -- whether -- what the Israelis do, 
a little bit more
psychological profiling
 through an interview, whether there's an element of 
profiling
. I mean, the larger question is, is there a better way here?
"
125,"
MR. RICHARD WOLFFE:
Well, let's just be clear, OK? This isn't about marketing. You know, this is about 
national security
. You've got a very risk-averse president who, as I explain in my book, was very unhappy with the way the 
Christmas Day
 bomber was proceeding and, and berated his 
national security
 team. So, with respect, I don't 
understand
 why a Democratic president or a Democratic 
administration
 introduces intrusive 
security
 measures, and that's an invasion of privacy; but a Republican president can, you know, have no-fly lists, no-fly lists that take up thousands of people...
"
126,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:
Well, I didn't, I didn't agree, I didn't agree with that either. But I think that one of the critical things...
"
127,"
MR. WOLFFE:
Well, wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second.
"
128,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:
No, 
listen to me
. One of the things we need to say...
"
129,"
MR. WOLFFE:
The Republican...
"
130,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:
...it is about 
trend analysis
, it is not about 
profiling
. 
And I
 think -- when I talk about marketing, I'm talking about talking to the 
American people
 about these changes in procedures.
"
131,"
MR. GREGORY:
In setting it up. But where does this go, 
Paul Gigot
? Where does this debate go, do you think?
"
132,"
MR. PAUL GIGOT:
I think the danger here is that the public begins to revolt against these kinds of 
security
 procedures.
"
133,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah.
"
134,"
MR. GIGOT:
And then you risk losing public support not just for airport screenings, but for the whole 
war on terror
 and the whole 
national security
 regime post-9/11. So I think we got to think very carefully whether this kind of intrusive pat-down is what we want to do. 
And I
 think, in the end -- we've already seen them move on children. No -- children under 12 now are not going to be...
"
135,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right. 
Pilots
 exempted now.
"
136,"
MR. GIGOT:

That's right
, pilots exempted now. I think there's going to be some real push back here, and the 
administration
 would do well to listen or lose support more broadly.
"
137,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right. But we have to remember that -- I always say, you know, the 
country
 was here after 9/11, maybe has gone down to here.
"
138,"
MR. ROBERT DRAPER:
Sure.
"
139,"
MR. GREGORY:
But, in terms of vigilance, could get right back up to here in a heartbeat. All you need is another 
Christmas Day
 attempt, or another attempt that we've heard about in months after that. And this is an effective way to 
deal with it
, and we have to put up with some of this.
"
140,"
MR. DRAPER:
Absolutely. 
And I
'm, I'm really struck listening to Congressman 
West
 of the -- of how this is not so much a debate between laissez-faire, 
libertarian
, 
tea party
 types and the 
Obama
administration
, but a debate between them, the former group, and the former head of the 
Republican Party
, 
President George W. Bush
, who in the wake of 9/11 really believed that no 
price
 was too dear for 
security
. And so, granted, there are a lot of arguments we could make in the margins about what's working and what is not. But, but finally this is about the 
price
 that we pay to be secure.
"
141,"
MR. GREGORY:
Congressman, is there -- do, do 
tea party
 candidates, or the 
tea party
 sentiment within 
Congress
 now...
"
142,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:
Yeah.
"
143,"
MR. GREGORY:
...of which I think you are a part, is there going to be a battle with the, with the 
Republican Party
 on issues like this that are -- become more about 
libertarian
 concerns?
"
144,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:
Well, I wouldn't say it's about 
libertarian
 concerns. I think that when you look at the 
tea party
, it is about a grassroots, constitutional, 
conservative movement
. And one of the critical parts of that is 
national security
. But I think that we need to 
focus
 our efforts and 
focus
 our 
national security
 efforts, and not come up with a lot of these somewhat seemingly knee-jerk reactions that we're seeing with this pat-down procedure. And once again, I think that we need to 
understand
 -- define who the enemy is, first and foremost, and then make sure that we have the 
security
 apparatus and procedures in place...
"
145,"
MR. GREGORY:
Do you think 
profiling
 is appropriate?
"
146,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:
I don't call it 
profiling
.
"
147,"
MR. GREGORY:
What do you call it?
"
148,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:
Let me tell you, I call it 
trend analysis
, because having been a commander in the battlefield, what you look for are trends, and you 
focus
 your 
resources
 on those trends. You know, 
profiling
 has become this negative, connotative phrase. But if we continue -- 
and I
 do think, you know, from the previous 
administration
 to this 
administration
, we have been somewhat 
lucky
 in, in the, in the thwarting of some of the attacks that we have seen. But we've got to be able to 
focus
 our 
security
 apparatus and 
resources
.
"
149,"
MR. GREGORY:

Richard Wolffe
, let me, 
let me go
 a little bit broader here. This was a snapshot of our 
NBC News
/
Wall Street Journal
 poll in terms of the view toward what's going to happen in 
Washington
 here between the president and 
Republicans
. It's a pretty, pretty dire view. 
Americans
 think there's going to be a lot of division, a lot of gridlock, little willingness to compromise by a margin of 76 percent to 19 percent. Whether it's the 
START treaty
 or the 
tax cuts
, what's, what's going to give here? Are 
Republicans
 saying to the president, ""Look, the 
price
 is now a lot higher to do business with us""?
"
150,"
MR. WOLFFE:
They've been very explicit, 
haven
't they? 
Mitch McConnell
 has said he wants the president to be a one-termer. The question is, if this plays out, especially for independent voters -- if you think that independent voters are what swung the last 
election
, where the 
Obama
administration
 has lost support in the last couple of years, what do they want to see? And now you have an alignment between 
Democrats
 and independents, they want the two sides to work together. If the 
Republicans
 are serious about this stuff, about moving to this more 
libertarian
 side of things, whether it's on 
START
 or it's on this 
TSA
 pat-down stuff, you're going to have a serious 
threat
 for 
Republicans
 about giving up their 
national security
 credentials. As we saw in 
2004
, that's a pretty risky position against an incumbent president at a time of war and 
terrorist threats
.
"
151,"
MR. GREGORY:
Look at the headlines, 
Paul Gigot
, from 
The Hill
 newspaper and others about liberals in the president's party. 
The Washington Times
 headline, ""Liberals prod 
Obama
 to show some muscle in the tax-cut battle.""
"
152,"
""Angry left to Obama:
Stop caving,"" that was in 
The Hill
. So now, I mean, the president's in a position where he probably -- he realizes he's got to move a little bit on the 
tax cut
 debate, extending the 
Bush
-era 
tax cuts
. But the left -- and 
Nancy Pelosi
's back as leader of the 
Democrats
 -- is saying, ""Not so fast here.""
"
153,"
MR. GIGOT:
No. The president's interests now are separate from the 
Democrats
 on the 
Hill
. When you're in the minority, you're going to want to oppose everything that the 
Republicans
 in the majority do because your interests are becoming the majority again. The president, 
on the other hand
, and 
Senate Democrats
, many of whom are up in 
2012
, have an interest in accomplishment and getting things done. So what I think you're going to see is the president is going to have to move to the 
center
, at least symbolically and substantively. Symbolically, I think, in a, in a, in a tonal sense, but substantively on some issues. 
And I
 would look for it to happen on 
taxes
, I would look to it to happen on some spending cuts. And 
Richard
 and the 
Democrats
 might not like this, but the truth is, he's going to have to do that if he wants to get re-elected.
"
154,"
MR. GREGORY:
The -- Congressman, the -- on the issue of 
tax cuts
, do you buy the president's argument, ""Look, let's extend those 
Bush
-era 
tax cuts
 for the 
middle class
 first, then we can come back and do the upper earners, or at least have that conversation""?
"
155,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:
No. I think that we need to extend those 
tax cuts
 permanently across the board. Look, I come from a -- an area down in 
South Florida
 where unemployment is at 13 percent, foreclosures are absolutely high. We are seeing closed upon closed storefronts. But yet, when you walk around here in 
Washington
, 
D.C.
, you don't see people getting laid off, you don't see, you know, anyone suffering, you don't see the foreclosures. There is a belief that things are not going well down on 
Main Street
, and they need to be heard. There is a belief that it has to start from up here with the right type of cuts in the spending, the right type of cuts in the growth of 
government
. So I think it's so important that we 
understand
 that we have to invigorate the, the growth of this 
country
, the long-term, 
sustainable growth
 of this 
country
, which comes from our small businesses and comes from our corporate business growth.
"
156,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. Well, leadership moment here. Look at some of the responses to the 
deficit
 commission and whether folks are uncomfortable with some of the proposals. Look at our polling and what it finds, pretty 
big numbers
. Seventy percent uncomfortable with cuts in spending for 
Medicare
, 
Social Security
 and 
defense
. 
Fifty-nine
 percent uncomfortable with increased 
taxes
, eliminating some deductions. 
Fifty-seven
 percent uncomfortable raising the 
Social Security
 retirement age to 69 over the next 60 years. Is it -- does all that have to be on the table for you as a freshman congressman coming in, all those cuts on the table?
"
157,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:
I, I think everything has to be on the table. I think that we need to have an honest conversation with the 
American people
. 
And I
 think that when you look at some of the things up here with the, the 
public sector
 compensation -- you know, we could find about $47 billion if we aligned 
government
 compensation with 
private sector
. We need to look at our 
Defense Department
. We need to look at, you know, how do we, you know, 
reform
 -- not 
reform
, but how do we repair 
Social Security
? How do we get 
Social Security
 back into that independent 
trust fund
 account? We need to look at how do we set the conditions economically so maybe we have less people that have to be on 
Social Security
, 
Medicare and Medicaid
? 
And I
 think that's one of the critical challenges we have to make going into this 112th 
Congress
.
"
158,"
MR. GREGORY:

Richard
, do you see the president advocating for some of this, this tough medicine here?
"
159,"
MR. WOLFFE:
I...
"
160,"
MR. GREGORY:
I mean, if the commission was 
political
 cover, I don't know. It doesn't look like a lot of cover yet.
"
161,"
MR. WOLFFE:
I think he was serious about the 
deficit
 stuff. You know, one of the stories I tell in ""Revival"" is how they had to game out whether or not they would get any 
Republicans
 at all to get on this 
deficit
 commission. That's how bad the politics of this are. But the president's talked about the 
deficit
 a lot. He, he knows that's what voters care about. This is a moment when he can actually say to these incoming members of 
Congress
, ""You talk about the 
deficit
, but if you take 
taxes
 off the table, how are you going to be serious about doing that? That's not a reasonable discussion."" His position, his natural default, is to say, ""The left is over here, the radical right's over there, I'm the serious grown-up in the middle."" That's where he's got to play this 
deficit
.
"
162,"
MR. GREGORY:
Is there a grand bargain that's possible, either one of you, with regard to 
taxes
 and spending, that they're both part of an equation?
"
163,"
MR. DRAPER:
I mean, I, I think on 
taxes
, it's a, it's a politically winning argument for the 
Republicans
 to say let's keep the 
Bush tax cuts
. But as 
Richard
 is saying, it presents 
President Obama
 with an 
opportunity
 to say, ""You've just left $300 billion of, of a way of lopping off the 
deficit
. You, you've left that off the table, so show me something that's worth $300 billion."" You can't say earmark 
reform
, that's $18 billion, that's chicken feed.
"
164,"
MR. WOLFFE:
Right.
"
165,"
MR. GIGOT:
But beyond that, beyond the 
Bush tax cuts
 and extending those, which I think won't happen for at least two years, the real 
opportunity
 for bipartisan agreement I -- here, I think, is 
tax reform
.
"
166,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
167,"
MR. GIGOT:
And you saw the reaction to the 
deficit
 commission proposal to lower the top rates...
"
168,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
169,"
MR. GIGOT:
...lower the rates and the corporate rate to as low as 23 percent at one option. And then you broaden the base, giving up certain deductions, which would be hard to do, but I think both parties see that this as a possibility to get together. I don't know if it'll happen in the next two years, but I think this is something -- and you saw it in the reaction. 
The Republican
 reaction to this, from 
Paul Ryan
 and 
Jeb Hensarling
 and others, was, ""
Let's talk
 about this."" And 
Nancy Pelosi
 said, ""No way. We can't 
talk about it
.""
"
170,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. Let's...
"
171,"
MR. GIGOT:
But the president has an interest in doing so.
"
172,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me take a break here. We're going to do that, we're going to come back, talk about the battleground 
2012
. The campaign's already started, whether we 
like it or not
, and we'll talk about specifically the ""
Sarah Palin
 effect."" Some news on that this morning, thanks to Mr. 
Draper
. Our 
roundtable
 continues right after this.
"
173,"

"
174,"
MR. GREGORY:
...the battleground 
2012
. I thought Governor 
Jindal
 said he doesn't want to be president yet. Didn't rule out being on a 
ticket
 in 
2012
. And when you write a book like ""Leadership in 
Crisis
,"" I think you're positioning yourself, but we'll put that out there. 
Let's talk
 about 
Sarah Palin
. Here is 
The New York Times Magazine
 that folks
"
175,"
are waking up to around the country, and on the cover, ""The Palin Network:
How the 
GOP
's 
Leading Shadow Candidate Runs Her Guerilla Organization
."" 
Robert Draper
, you wrote this piece. You talked to her. A portion of this is from your interview with Governor 
Palin
. She says this, ""I know that a hurdle I would have to cross, that some other potential candidates wouldn't have to cross right out of the chute, is proving my record. That's the most frustrating thing for me the warped and perverted description of my record and what I've accomplished over the last two decades. It's been much more perplexing to me than where the lamestream media has wanted to go about my 
personal life
. And other candidates 
haven
't faced these criticisms the way I have."" Her record does matter. Her ability to be seen, as 
Karl Rove
 says in his piece in 
The Wall Street Journal
 this week, can folks 
look at her
 and imagine her in the 
Oval Office
?
"
176,"
MR. DRAPER:

Well...

"
177,"
MR. GREGORY:
She's not there yet.
"
178,"
MR. DRAPER:
That's the big question. I mean, what she was referring to was her record as governor of 
Alaska
, but I don't think that moves the needle on her approval ratings. I mean, I think that, that, you know, the, the question that she's going to have to answer is, if ""commonsense conservatism"" is shorthand for ""I 
haven
't learned the issues."" And, and, you know, she has done more to close the substance 
deficit
. I mean, her -- she's had increasingly wonkish speeches. But yeah, there's this cognitive dissonance of seeing her climbing a glacier. It's kind of a cool visual, but is that the same visual of being in the 
Oval Office
? I mean, she's got a ways to go on that.
"
179,"
MR. GREGORY:
She, she spoke, as well, in this new show that she's got on 
TLC
, five million viewers, an interesting clip from her 
reality show
. I want to show that.
"
180,"

"
181,"
MS. SARAH PALIN:
You know, having every word, every action scrutinized and, in some cases, mocked, I can handle it. I, you know, I kind of have asked for it, right?
"
182,"

"
183,"
MR. GREGORY:
Congressman, it is interesting. I mean, she's certainly out there in the arena. Look, she endorsed you.
"
184,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:
Yes.
"
185,"
MR. GREGORY:
What kind of impact did that have? And what is your assessment of her strength after the midterms?
"
186,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:
Well, I have to tell you this, right now I 
haven
't even been sworn in, so I think the most important thing we need to be focused on is, how do we take care of the problems that are facing this 
country
? Because if we don't do that, if this 
Republican Congress
 and the 
House of Representatives
 does not do that, it does not matter who you put up for president...
"
187,"
MR. GREGORY:
Fair enough.
"
188,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:
...in 
2012
.
"
189,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
190,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:
So that's what the people are looking for. Now, I will tell you this, you know, she did endorse me with four other 
military
 candidates back in March of this year. It was good to have her endorsement because she does have a, a reach to the 
grassroots movement
, but it is also incumbent upon me to be able to, once I get that trust and confidence, to come up here and prove myself worthy of what the people have shown. But this is also
"
191,"
important:
The, the 
world
 is 
Machiavellian
, not so much 
Kantian
, and the next president of the 
United States
 has to 
understand
 that there are wolves out there. And the next president of the 
United States
 is going to have to sit down at a table and stare down some very tough customers.
"
192,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
193,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:

And I
 think that's the 
number
 one criteria we need to be thinking about as we move forward.
"
194,"
MR. GREGORY:
It's interesting, 
Richard Wolffe
, if you look, 
Ron Brownstein
 has written some about this for the 
National Journal
, the idea that there are some similarities, if you look at the, the landscape on the right of how a candidate 
Palin
 could draw votes away from a 
Mitt Romney
 or another candidate that, that he describes it as a ""beer-wine track phenomenon."" But in other words, the 
working class
 white voters, in the way that 
Hillary Clinton
 got those voters in her 
primary
 fight with 
Obama
, that that's the space that she could occupy as well.
"
195,"
MR. WOLFFE:
Right. But her basic problem is that she has a 35 percent approval rating among independents.
"
196,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
197,"
MR. WOLFFE:
When you start that that low among a group that has essentially decided every 
election
 in recent memory, you've got a huge problem, a mountain to climb. And combine that with the popularity of the grass roots among the 
primary
 voters in the 
Republican party
, it's a dynamic that is going to tear this thing apart. And it reminds me of 
Howard Dean
. I covered 
Howard Dean
 in 
2004
. Strong grassroots support, people looked at the numbers and said he's not going to make it. I think that's one of the reasons why 
Sarah Palin
 did well in the 
House
 level, but not so well in the 
Senate
 race. I mean, her 
Senate
-backed candidates did not perform well and that's because the wider appeal is not there.
"
198,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm. She's going to shake things up, though, for 
Iowa
, that's for sure.
"
199,"
MR. GIGOT:
Well, I -- well, I think so, if she does decide to run. Politics, though, is additive, as 
Richard
 points out. You've got to build on your base. I think the field is wide open, the Republican field, and I think she has a chance to get the, to get the nomination if she runs. She has a lot of likability, people really think that -- they love her sincerity. She comes across as real, not practiced, not canned. But she does have to make the case to people that she can do the job. She has to look 
presidential
, and that will -- and particularly, to people in the suburbs around 
Philadelphia
 and the suburbs. 
Republicans
 did very well in 
Wisconsin
, for example.
"
200,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
201,"
MR. GIGOT:
How are you going to make the sale to those 
swing voters
 and independents? You want a 
state
 like that.
"
202,"
MR. GREGORY:
What did you learn about how the 
Palin
world
 operates, though, that is clearly unconventional and is not following any script? I mean, if 
Republicans
 are known for the next one in line and a lot of order...
"
203,"
MR. DRAPER:
Sure. Yeah.
"
204,"
MR. GREGORY:
...this is -- she's not playing with that script.
"
205,"
MR. DRAPER:
It is the polar opposite of, say, the 
Bush
 organization of 
2004
. I mean, it's people playing outside their lanes. No one has a title. People essentially do what's in front of them. And 
Paul
 and I were discussing it before, I mean, there's -- it's -- those of us in the media who tried to reach out to the 
Palin
 organization are faced with, you know, endless delays and, and often pocket vetoing. And, and, and it is not an organization that can any way transfer itself to a campaign structure. 
Palin
 herself recognizes that. She said as much to me. But he question is, will she be able to bring in people whom she trusts, who are capable of doing this sort of thing. Trust is a huge issue with the 
Palins
. They feel like they were really burned in 
2008
. And the question is, how much of an informing characteristic will that be going forward?
"
206,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. We're going to take another break here, quickly. We'll come back. We'll have some final thoughts in just a moment from our 
roundtable
. Don't go away.
"
207,"

"
208,"
MR. GREGORY:
We're back with our 
roundtable
. Some closing thoughts. 
Richard Wolffe
, the book is ""Revival."" How does the 
White House
, how does the president think about the road to recovery politically right now?
"
209,"
MR. WOLFFE:
Well, for a start, there's a reason, one of the reasons I called it ""Revival"" is because 10 months ago this guy was written off for dead. 
Health care
 was dead. He was finished. Two months later, he gets 
health care
 and, incidentally, a 
treaty
 with the Russians. It's happened 
time and again
. Through the primaries, when 
Sarah Palin
 was nominated, this guy was over. There is something of the comeback about him, and they're hoping it's going to happen again. How does he do it? He's got to get back to where he was in 
2008
, the 
change guy
, change the way business is done. If he's just another 
inside Washington
 politician, he's going to be in trouble.
"
210,"
MR. GREGORY:
But everybody I talk to, Congressman, says this is not somebody who tacks to the 
center
, doesn't play small ball, was not a tactical player. And that, that becomes a choice for him, just as conservatives have a choice about how they want to use this power they've got.
"
211,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:
Absolutely. 
And I
 think the critical thing is to look at the first 90 to 
120 days
. What is the relationship between the 
House GOP
, the 
Senate
, and the 
administration
? I think you have to look and see what is going to be the impact of this incredible freshman class that's coming in that's one-third of the 
House GOP
. I think it was very -- the historical metaphor I use comparing 
Nancy Pelosi
 being brought back in as minority leader, 
Pickett's charge
. I mean, if we had given 
Picket
 another division and told him to go and try it again. So I think that those three things are going to be the interesting dynamics.
"
212,"
MR. GREGORY:
What is your mandate as you come to town? What is your mandate?
"
213,"
REP.-ELECT WEST:
My mandate is to listen to the 
American people
, the people that sent us up here. And the mandate is to do something about the, the growth of 
government
, the, the spending of 
government
, and get back to a constitutional based principle of governance.
"
214,"
MR. GREGORY:

Paul Gigot
, quickly, do 
Republicans
 have a mandate to actually cooperate at some level. Do they have something? Do they need something tangible at this point?
"
215,"
MR. GIGOT:
I think they do need something tangible on 
taxes
, and I think in terms of spending cuts. They need to show a reduction in the growth of 
government
. I don't think they need to get a huge, all encompassing budget deal, but they need to show that they're attempting to do that in the 
House
.
"
216,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right. And are they 
willing
 to...
"
217,"
MR. GIGOT:
Put that on the table in the 
House
.
"
218,"
MR. GREGORY:
Are they 
willing
 to advocate really 
Draconian
 cuts in the face of the headwinds here?
"
219,"
MR. DRAPER:
This is what interests me.
"
220,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah.
"
221,"
MR. DRAPER:
I will be very curious to see. You know, we've been hearing a mantra from a lot of the incoming freshman about blowing up the appropriations process from the inside. So I'll be very curious to see if they actually do that or if they succumb to the temptation, when some of them seated on the 
Appropriations Committee
, to throw that money around for pet projects for their constituents.
"
222,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. We are going to leave it there. Thank you all very much. Before we go, a little piece of history. In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the 
election
 of

228,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  There's no other reason not to do it than the fact that, you know, Washington has, has become a very partisan place.  And this is a classic area where we have to rise above partisanship."
229,(End videotape)
230,"MR. GREGORY:  Is the new START treaty a matter of immediate national security, or will it get held up in post-election politics?  Plus, the president at the NATO summit in Portugal this weekend pressed his allies for support of the U.S. endgame in Afghanistan, even as new questions arise back home about how and whether to try terror suspects in U.S. courts.  Our guest this morning, from the summit, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton."

232,"Then, a leading voice from the Republican Party unleashes a blistering attack of the president's leadership during the gulf oil spill.  How does the GOP lead as it seeks the presidency in 2012?  My guest, author of the new book ""Leadership and Crisis,"" Republican governor of Louisiana, Bobby Jindal."
233,"Finally, our political roundtable on the fights ahead in Congress over taxes and spending, and an early look at battleground 2012. Sarah Palin's new book sets the stage for a presidential run.  With us, Robert Draper, whose piece about Palin's inner circle appears as the cover story
of The New York Times Magazine this morning; editorial page editor of The Wall Street Journal, Paul Gigot; Richard Wolffe, author of the new book ""Revival,"" about President Obama; and incoming freshman tea party-backed Republican congressman from Florida, Allen West."
234,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
235,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
236,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Breaking news in The New York Times this morning that North Korea has built a large nuclear facility to enrich uranium.  An American nuclear scientist who visited the site telling the Times he was ""stunned"" by the sophistication of this new plant.  This further
complicates the president's nuclear disarmament agenda from North Korea to Russia to Iran, which was front and center at the NATO summit in Portugal, as the president used the world stage to press his Republican opponents in Congress to ratify a new nuclear arms deal with Russia."
237,"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was with the president at the summit, and I spoke with her before she departed Lisbon. "
238,"Secretary Clinton, welcome back to the program."
239,"SEC'Y HILLARY CLINTON:  Thank you very much, David."
240,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to talk about this showdown between the president and Senate Republicans over the START treaty.  The president, in his comments to reporters, made it very clear he thinks politics is being played here, saying to reporters, ""Nobody's going to score any political points to 2012."" Is that the president's belief here about what's standing in the way?  And in your view, is this really a, a litmus test of whether there can be bipartisanship in Washington after the election?"
241,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  Well, I think the president believes strongly, and I agree with him, that this treaty is in the national security interest of the United States.  And it's not only Americans who believe that.  I'm, you know, very impressed by the number of leaders at the NATO Lisbon
summit who voluntarily told their own press, or American press, they were chasing down reporters to say this is so much in the interest of Europe and others.  So the president sees this very clearly.  But I don't think he considers this a political issue.  It's a question of whether we have the time and whether we can make the case in the limited time that the
lame duck provides to satisfy the concerns of two-thirds of the Senate. I think we can.  I think that everyone has operated in good faith.  We have looked hard at this.  When it came out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it came out with an overwhelming bipartisan vote,
14-to-4.  I think that the questions are being--that are being asked by Republicans deserve thoughtful answers.  And everyone in the administration stands ready, from Bob Gates to Jim Clapper, the head of the--director of national intelligence, because we all see it in the same
way. And we're in the tradition of both Republican and Democratic presidents, going back to Ronald Reagan, who famously said, ""Trust, but verify."" We have no verification without a treaty about what's going on in Russia's nuclear program.  So I think whether you're already convinced or can be convinced, I think we want to get our inspectors back on the ground, and the only way to do that is by ratifying this treaty."
242,"MR. GREGORY:  Is there an issue, though, of American prestige?  The president was dealt a setback on fair trade when he was in Seoul.  There was a feeling, when it comes to whether it's trade or economic policy, that America can't always get what it wants.  Is this going to
potentially be a problem of the president not being able to get what he wants on the world stage because of Republicans?"
243,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  Well, first of all, I think that the president didn't agree to a trade deal in Seoul because he didn't feel like it was enough in America's interest.  That's what a president is supposed to do. Obviously, he's still working to get one finalized that is."
244,"And in respect to START, which concerns, not just trade, but life or death, because we're talking about thousands of nuclear warheads that are still pointed at the United States, the president believes this does go beyond politics.  You can argue about a trade deal, but what the tradition has been in the Senate, going back to the 1980s with President Reagan, is that once people have had a chance to carefully consider these arms control treaties, they have been passed overwhelmingly.  We've seen it with the Reagan and the Bush administrations, the Clinton administration.  Now, of course..."
245,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
246,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  ...we are in the Obama administration.  And in this one area, this goes beyond politics.  This should be nonpartisan, not just bipartisan."
247,"MR. GREGORY:  Secretary Clinton, let me get to a few other areas, including the war in Afghanistan.  Listening to the president, listening and following the events that have happened at the NATO summit, I wonder whether the Washington clock for the war has changed, and that Americans should expect that by next July there's a token number of U.S. forces
that are withdrawn, and that, really, the war doesn't end for America until 2014."
248,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  No, David, I think that we've been very clear about this, that the transition to Afghan security lead begins next year in 2011.  It is conditions-based.  So where it can happen, at what pace it can happen, how many troops can be substituted for, that is what General Petraeus and the military leaders are going to be working on to recommend to the
president and the leaders of other countries."
249,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let me get in on a key point, then.  Is it possible then, even at 2014, when you envision and you hope that a transition is complete, might the United States have a long-term presence there, say, in the form of permanent air bases, to maintain a presence in the country?"
250,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  Well, we're, we're intent upon reaching the goal of transitioning to Afghan security in 2014.  But both the United States and NATO-ISAF partners have said that, of course, we'd be willing to continue to help train and equip the Afghan military, what we do with countries around the world. There could be other missions that other countries would take on in terms of civilian aid and supporting the government.  So the security lead, the, the fight, if you will, does transition to the Afghans. Support for that fight will continue to be provided by..."
251,"MR. GREGORY:  What, what about..."
252,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  ...not just the United States, but others."
253,MR. GREGORY:  ...permanent bases?  Permanent bases?
254,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  There's, there's been no decision whatsoever about any of that."
255,MR. GREGORY:  But is that possible?  Is that something that the U.S. is considering?
256,SEC'Y CLINTON:  There's no consideration.  It's just not on the table at this point.
257,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about--as secretary of State, you don't have to deal with airport security, but so many Americans do, especially coming up in this Thanksgiving week."
258,SEC'Y CLINTON:  Right.  Right.
259,MR. GREGORY:  There's obviously a security threat out there...
260,SEC'Y CLINTON:  Right.
261,"MR. GREGORY:  ...a terror threat, which is why you have this advanced technology and why you have these rather invasive pat-downs that we're seeing throughout airports around the country.  Is this excessive, or is this the right response to the kind of threat environment that Americans face?"
262,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  Well, the people responsible for our security, such as Secretary Napolitano, obviously believe that this is necessary.  And I'm not going to comment or certainly second-guess their considered opinions. At the same time, I think everyone, including our security experts, are looking for ways to diminish the impact on the traveling public.  I mean, obviously the vast, vast majority of people getting on these planes are law-abiding citizens who are just trying to get from, you know, one place to another.  But let's not kid ourselves.  The terrorists are adaptable, they start doing whatever they can to try to cause harm.  And when you
have people who are willing to die in order to kill Americans and others--you've got folks putting explosives in their underwear, who would have thought that?  So striking the right balance is what this is about. And I am absolutely confident that our security experts are going to keep trying to get it better and less intrusive and more precise.  But at the same time, we want people to travel safely."
263,"MR. GREGORY:  And a follow-up on, on terrorism.  The Ahmed Ghailani case that was concluded this week with a conviction has raised new questions about whether it's wise to put these terror suspects in civilian courts. As secretary of State, why is it important to the rest of the world that these hardened terror suspects go in U.S. civilian courts to be tried?"
264,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  Well, I think it's important, first and foremost, to Americans, which is my highest priority, what, what is best for the United States and for our own citizens.  The civilian courts, known as Article III courts under the Constitution, have a good track record of
convicting terrorists.  And, in fact, if you look at the comparison between terrorists who are now serving time in our maximum security prisons compared to what military commissions have been able to do, there's no comparison.  We get convictions, we send people away in our
civilian courts at a much more regularized and predictable way than yet we've been able to figure out how in the military commissions. "
265,"Secondly, I think there's a misconception in our own country about what's admissible in terms of evidence in a civilian court vs. a military commission.  They don't have the same rules, but the rules are close enough in terms of what can or can't be admitted into evidence.  So
there's a, there's a very strong argument that what the judge in the Ghailani case said..."
266,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
267,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  ...could not be admitted, would not have been admissible, either..."
268,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, right, and that's kind of..."
269,SEC'Y CLINTON:  ...in a military commission.
270,"MR. GREGORY:  And that's a very narrow issue, but the real issue is there's a lot of uncertainty in the criminal justice system, as you well know, as a lawyer..."
271,SEC'Y CLINTON:  But there--but...
272,"MR. GREGORY:  ...and in a civilian case.  But my question is, are we committed with these terror suspects that if they are acquitted in civilian courts, they should be released?"
273,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  Well, no.  And don't forget, we're not going to..."
274,MR. GREGORY:  Then why--but then why hold up the American system...
275,SEC'Y CLINTON:  But...
276,MR. GREGORY:  ...as the right route if you're not going to release them? That's what the American system says you have to do.
277,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  But, David, first of all, our system is the best system in the world.  We all know that.  It is good enough and strong enough to either convict and sentence the guilty or even execute, where appropriate, and, where you can't convince an American jury, which is
certainly obsessed with terrorism, maybe there's a question about the strength of the case.  And I think what we are trying to do is get the best result consistent with our laws and Constitution.  And under our laws, military commissions are legal for certain cases, but it should be the primary decision to use our civilian courts whenever and wherever possible."
278,"So I, I think that this has become a kind of strange argument.  On the one hand, people say we want to convict these people.  The civilian courts have a better record of actually convicting and imprisoning than we do yet have in the military commission.  But we also don't want to have security problems or publicity problems for particularly dangerous leading terrorists, so we should look at the military commission.  So I, I think that this is a difficult issue, but I really hope that everyone can look at it carefully and consider all of the facts concerning this."
279,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Secretary Clinton, before I let you go, I have to ask you this, just as a political observer, what do you make of what happened on Election Day?  And all this talk about Sarah Palin, when I interviewed you a while back, you said you'd be willing to sit down and have coffee with her. She may be someone who is in a position to try to equal what you accomplished in the political arena.  What, what advice might you give her?  And what do you make of what's happened politically?"
280,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  You know, David, the best thing about being secretary of State is representing the United States around the world, but the second best thing is I'm out of politics.  So, with all due respect, I am not going to comment on the political scene right now, other than to say that I'm focused on making the case to 67-plus senators in the Senate to pass the START treaty because that's, to me, the, the most important task facing the Senate, and it goes way beyond politics."
281,"MR. GREGORY:  And here I thought I'd lulled you into a moment of candor. Secretary Clinton, thank you very much, as always."
282,"SEC'Y CLINTON:  Thank you, David."
283,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We now turn to the author of the new book ""Leadership and Crisis,"" Republican governor of Louisiana, Bobby Jindal."
284,"Governor, welcome back to the program.  When we talk about politics, you're going to have to answer all the questions."
285,GOV. BOBBY JINDAL (R-LA):  Well...
286,MR. GREGORY:  You can't wiggle out.  You can't use the secretary of State argument on.  I'm just putting you on notice.
287,GOV. JINDAL:  That's right.  That's not my job.  Thank you for having me back.
288,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
289,GOV. JINDAL:  It's great to be back.
290,"MR. GREGORY:  I, I want to talk, because your book deals a lot with the issue of the role of government.  And we'll talk about the gulf oil spill in just a moment.  But let me pick up on an area that I asked Secretary Clinton about, the TSA, these airport screeners and some of these
searches that are really disturbing people around the country, is this excessive?"
291,"GOV. JINDAL:  Absolutely.  Now, look, let's start off, we cannot be lackadaisical about protecting our country against terrorists, make no mistake about that.  But I've got two primary concerns with how they're doing this. First, George Will, Charles Krauthammer, others have made this point..."
292,MR. GREGORY:  Conservative columnists.
293,"GOV. JINDAL:  Other conservative columnists have made this point; they're not using common sense, they're not using intelligence.  Look, there's no reason for them to be doing these body searches of six-year-old, 12-year-old girls traveling from Louisiana to visit their grandparents.
We're not talking about profiling, but use the information to actually--don't let political correctness stop them.  Use the information we have to actually apply our defenses to those most likely to cause us harm."
294,"But here's the second concern.  It feels too much, from this administration, like we're playing a defensive game in the war on terrorism.  Yes, we need to harden our infrastructure, but if you have a committed terrorist who's willing to give up their lives, you look at that past pattern.  We got lucky with the bomb in Times Square, we got lucky with the cargo packages, we got lucky with the underwear bomber that the devices didn't go off.  Luck is not a strategy. We need to be rooting out these networks, we need to be killing these terrorists.  I think that the American people are worried when they see an administration worried about reading Miranda rights to the underwear bomber. They worry when they see an administration committed to civilian trials.  They wonder, ""You're so worried about the rights of the terrorists, what about the rights of the innocent American traveler?"" So, absolutely, I'm concerned that out of political correctness, they're screening people they don't really believe to be dangerous."
295,MR. GREGORY:  So you think profiling is really a better option.
296,"GOV. JINDAL:  I don't think it's profiling.  I think it's using the information we know.  You look at things like, for example, you look at travel patterns, you look at how they purchase their ticket, you look at the information, the intel we've got.  We all know--and again, George
Will and others make this point so articulately--we all know that the grandmother who's being, being body searched doesn't really pose the threat.  We know the little girl going to visit her grandmother--here's the third thing that is also odd. The administration rolled this out
right before the busiest travel time of the entire year, never making their case to the American public.  If they really believed this was a response to a genuine threat, why didn't they make their case to the American public?  The bottom line is, yes, we need to secure our country,
but simply playing defense isn't enough."
297,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let me..."
298,"GOV. JINDAL:  Yes, we need to harden our infrastructure."
299,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
300,"GOV. JINDAL:  But I think that it's hard to, to listen to an administration that's reading the Miranda rights, stopping the interrogation of the underwear bomber.  And it's so hard to understand, why are they so worried about the terrorist's rights and not our rights?"
301,"MR. GREGORY:  You know, you, you write about this in your book, and I want to put a portion of it out the way you talk about a therapeutic foreign policy. We'll get that portion of your book and put it on the screen.  You write that ""Our current therapeutic approach to national
security is dangerous.  I'm just not interested in empathizing with the `grievances' of our sworn enemies. Let's figure out where they're vulnerable and destroy them."" And hearing what you just said, I think a lot of people would hear that and say, ""Is that a serious commentary?"" I
mean, you keep mentioning the Christmas Day bomber, who actually confessed to what he was doing; and the Miranda rights were not read until later, number one.  How could you say that this administration, which has so many areas of continuity and is more robust in targeting
terrorists in Pakistan, surging up forces in Afghanistan, a continuity with regard to treatment of, of terror suspects and detainees, how could this be a therapeutic approach to foreign policy and national security?"
302,"GOV. JINDAL:  Well, three things.  One, I think the Bush administration was also wrong, by the way, the way they treated Richard Reid, the, the shoe bomber.  I, I don't just criticize this president, I criticize President Bush."
303,MR. GREGORY:  So you think President Bush just got lucky?
304,GOV. JINDAL:  No.  I...
305,"MR. GREGORY:  When there was no strike after--well, how does Obama just get lucky, but President Bush is better?"
306,"GOV. JINDAL:  Wait a minute.  Let me answer your question.  First, I think he was wrong and the administration was wrong in the way they approached that bomber in the same way.  I mean, go back to the Miranda rights for the, the underwear bomber.  What evidence do they need?  He--I mean, they caught him with the device.  What was the purpose?  You asked
a great question to Secretary Clinton:  Why are we doing these civilian trials if they're not going to release them?  Why are we compromising sources?"
307,"But here's the second point.  You look at some of President Obama's writings. You look at how he talks about, ""Well, we need to understand the, the disadvantaged backgrounds.  This is a matter of social justice and more foreign aid."" Nonsense.  The analysts have looked at the
terrorists that are coming at us.  A--the disproportionate share are educated, come from privileged backgrounds.  The reality is, this isn't about people who don't have enough jobs, who don't have enough social aid.  This is about fighting an enemy that hates our way of life.  This
is a fundamental clash of cultures. And I think that it's important to the war on terrorism that we understand what's at stake.  This isn't, ""Well, let's go and figure out a way to apologize for America."" This isn't, ""Have we offended them because we're supporting Israel?"" I think
our foreign policy needs to be based around the understanding this is an enemy that hates our--and disagrees with our fundamental freedoms."
308,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's, let's bring it back home.  Let's talk about your book, ""Leadership in Crisis."" Here's some video back in May of you having a pretty heated discussion with the president.  And we don't have to relitigate the whole issue there.  It had to do with expanding food stamp assistance for those affected by the spill.  He was concerned about a
letter that you had sent out and some of the timing issues, but you make a larger point as a result of that discussion, and, and you write about it in the book.  ""That encounter with President Obama served as a reminder to me of why Americans are so frustrated with Washington:  the feds focus on the wrong things.  Political posturing becomes more
important than reality.  In Washington they live by the motto: `Perception is reality.' They worry about things they shouldn't and fail to do things that they should focus on.  It's called core competence, or lack thereof."" Was the administration incompetent in dealing with the
gulf oil spill? "
309,"GOV. JINDAL:  Absolutely.  And look, that whole conversation, and even in their response to the book, the administration doesn't get it.  They were mad--he was mad about food stamps.  The point was two weeks after the explosion, the, the main issue wasn't food stamps.  We were frustrated by the lack of resources, lack of a plan."
310,"I write in the book, for example, that there was literally one case, oil coming into Timbalier Bay.  There's boom, there, there are resources, there are people, there are boats sitting on the dock in Cocodrie.  I take the federal government official in charge of the response to
Louisiana by Black Hawk helicopter so he can see the oil, thinking, of course, we'll get a response now.  When he sees the oil, he admits there's oil, he admits the resources there.  He tells me, because of the bureaucracy, it'll take 24 to 48 hours to move those resources, get them mobilized.  That's too late."
311,"A second instance, we have a locally devised solution:  vacuum barges to pick up the oil out of the water.  The federal government shuts it down for over 24 hours so they can check the valves, so they can count the number of life jackets and fire extinguishers, so they can do routine inspections.  After being embarrassed publicly, 24 hours later they admit, ""We don't need to do the inspections."" But they waste that time in the meantime."
312,"Look, the White House comes back in response to the book and says, ""Well, we talked to the governor every day."" It wasn't access.  We had access. We had plenty of access.  It was not getting timely action.  You and I were talking about the bureaucracy, the red tape.  Fake five years ago, in the federal response to Katrina, we saw some of the same impediments again, in response to the oil spill.  At one point, we pointed out there was boom, there was materials all over the country sitting in warehouses and facilities.  It took too long to relax the regulations to move those resources to the gulf coast. That would be like fighting a war, running out of ammunition on the front lines, having ammunition sitting in the warehouses because that's what the rules say.  They didn't cut through the red tape and bureaucracy.  They didn't always realize what were the most important things to get done."
313,"MR. GREGORY:  The White House has struck back pretty hard at this.  You know, one of the things you talk about is being more concerned with the PR strategy, and yet, look at the cover at this book, ""Leadership in Crisis."" I mean, you know, you've got a picture of you in, in response to the gulf oil spill.  This could be certainly seen as a way to, to shore up your own political standing and use your own PR.  And the White House says this, this is a statement they provided to us about some of the substance in the book.  I'll put it on the screen.  ""The governor requested the national guard, we approved and he never put them to work. Governor Jindal pushed for his berms,"" those sand berms, we can talk more in just minute, ""which everyone has agreed were a mistake. Governor Jindal said that we didn't have a plan for skimmers"" and ""or boom, when he knows perfectly well that we did, [National Incident Commander Adm.] Thad Allen described it to him countless times, and Gov.  Jindal's own office approved the plans.  He got a daily update on the status of skimmers and boom from the Coast Guard in advance of the daily call."" There's nothing, ""this is nothing more than trying to sell a book."""
314,"GOV. JINDAL:  Well, look, the first meeting, he comes on, he tips off the Washington reporter, ""Watch this interaction."" He tells them, ""I'm going to be mad with the governor."""
315,"MR. GREGORY:  You see--the president, you're saying."
316,"GOV. JINDAL:  The president, the, the White House, I'm not sure he actually called all those reporters up and said, ""Watch this."" The second time he comes down to Louisiana, at the end of the second meeting--we have a meeting with parish presidents, other elected officials.  The end of the second meeting, he turns to me and Billy Nungesser, parish--president of Plaquemines Parish, and says, ""And I don't want you guys going on TV to criticize me."" This is the president of the United States, and he's more worried not about, ""Guys, here's the plan.  Here's how we're going to fight the oil."" Here was the problem, and you look again at the response.  Yeah, we talked to him every day, but the, the frustration was actually getting a response, actually getting them to move the assets on the ground.  Time and time again, they wouldn't listen to local fishermen.  They wouldn't listen to people who lived down there,
who know those waters like the back of their hands.  From the beginning, they continued to be over reliant on the experts from BP and others. They underestimated the threat.  You know, you remember the first several days, there's no..."
317,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
318,GOV. JINDAL:  ...oil.  Then it's a thousand barrels.
319,"MR. GREGORY:  But what about your role, Governor.  I mean, your big issue is pushing to build this, this chain of sand berms to get the oil to stop coming ashore.  By all accounts, it had a negligible effect, at best. "
320,"GOV. JINDAL:  Well, that, that's not true, David.  We were very pleased. Two things about the sand berms.  We've now built over 12 miles, and this is going to be the largest coastal island restoration project in our state's history, which is something, by the way, that is good for our
coast, independent of the oil spill, good to protect us against hurricane surge as well as oil spill. We've collected thousands of pounds of oily debris off these berms.  We have been able to stop oil both on the surface and submerged oil.  And here's the third thing, if they hadn't
slowed us down, they took almost a month to approve the permits.  Even after they approved the permits, they wouldn't allow us to dredge the sand from the areas they had already approved.  We could have built many more miles."
321,"The sand berms were a great success, but here's--this is another great example.  They weren't willing to think outside the box.  The federal government themselves approved.  The US Corps of Engineers said the positives outweigh the negatives.  The--Admiral Allen and the president both intervened to approve six of those segments.  They themselves--this was a preapproved Coast Guard response to an oil spill, very effective. We are thrilled we did those sand berms."
322,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Well, scientists will disagree with that, but we'll..."
323,"GOV. JINDAL:  Not every scientist.  Now wait a minute, the, the--it--let's not say that everybody disagrees.  There are scientists that absolutely say this was one of the best things we could do for coast.  Now that we've convinced BP not to just make them temporary
berms, but to convert them into coastal islands, the, the restoration of what was the original footprint, there are many scientists who have praised this as one of the most significant steps forward."
324,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Let me ask you a bottom line question.  Haley Barbour, the governor of Mississippi, somebody who's, who's been a mentor to you, a very important Republican figure, he said on this program back in June, the federal government's done more right than wrong.  What do you know that he doesn't know?  What have you seen that he didn't see assessing the situation?"
325,"GOV. JINDAL:  Well, you go back, you go back to that day.  Louisiana at that point had--it continued to bear the brunt of the oil coming in to our coast, and our frustration was, again, when we wanted resources, they weren't there. When their resources weren't available, we came up with solutions, like jack up barges to make the boom last longer so we could deploy it in real time.  It literally--it took meetings with the president of the United States to cut through the bureaucracy to get that done.  And they wasted time in the meantime."
326,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
327,"GOV. JINDAL:  We wanted solutions like using hard pipe to deflect oil. It took too long for them.  What we basically said was, ""If you don't have the resources, let us protect our own coast.  At least, either lead or get out of the way."" And the problem was, either they didn't provide the resources, then when we tried, they interfered with our efforts."
328,MR. GREGORY:  Just a minute left here.  Some politics questions here.  Do you think the president's a one-term president?
329,"GOV. JINDAL:  I think it's up to him.  I think the voters said a couple of weeks ago they want to see less deficits, less spending, $14 trillion and counting is too much.  The government 24 percent of GDP is too high. They don't want this administration to focus on Obamacare, cap and trade, card check.  They want this administration and Congress focused on getting the private sector economy running and growing again."
330,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
331,"GOV. JINDAL:  If he changes direction, he can certainly make a, a stronger case.  But if he stays, if he doubles down on his current path, I think it's going to be very hard to make the case two years from now that he deserves to be re-elected."
332,MR. GREGORY:  You don't want to be president in 2012?
333,GOV. JINDAL:  No.  You've got the tape from me last time.
334,"MR. GREGORY:  I do.  You, would you be on a ticket?  Would you be a number two?"
335,"GOV. JINDAL:  Look, I'm running for re-election in 2011.  I'm running to be the governor of Louisiana.  There will be other candidates running for president and vice president."
336,"MR. GREGORY:  Would you rule out, rule out being a number two on a ticket?"
337,GOV. JINDAL:  I'm not going to turn down something that's not been offered to me.
338,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
339,"GOV. JINDAL:  But I'm not running for vice president.  I'm, I'm..."
340,MR. GREGORY:  Would you like to be president some day?
341,"GOV. JINDAL:  I, look, my only political aspiration is to be re-elected governor for a second term.  We've cut spending in Louisiana. Portfolio.com says we've got the second best economic performance in the country.  We're not raising taxes."
342,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
343,GOV. JINDAL:  I think we can prove a great example in Louisiana of what Washington should be doing instead of borrowing and printing more money. 
344,MR. GREGORY:  Sarah Palin gets a great deal of attention as a movement conservative.  Can she unite the Republican Party and actually be the nominee?
345,"GOV. JINDAL:  I think she can make a compelling case.  I think there's several governors, former governors, and others."
346,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
347,"GOV. JINDAL:  My bias is, and I've said this before, I like governors because they have to balance their budgets, they have to run their states.  They actually have to, to..."
348,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Well, she, she was a governor.  But the question is, I'm sure she could make a compelling case, but do you think she can unify the party and actually get the nomination, as you survey the landscape?"
349,"GOV. JINDAL:  I--look, I'll leave it to the pundits.  I'm sure she can. But I'm sure there are a lot of other candidates.  I think there's such a focus on the messengers, what's more important is the message.  The Republican Party, Karl Rove says we're on probation.  He's right.  We're
on borrowed time.  Four years ago we blew it because we defended--the Republican Party defended earmarks and spending we would never accept. Now the Republicans, I'm glad they've shifted their position on earmarks.They've got to cut nondefense discretionary spending.  We've got to show in the next two years we're worthy of being a majority party by cutting spending back to historic norms, cutting taxes, getting the private sector economy growing.  Let the pundits figure out who's running in 2012, who the nominee is going to be, who the RNC chair is going to be. What's more important for us is to show the American people we've learned our lessons, we deserve to be a majority party again."
350,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Governor, thank you very much."
351,"GOV. JINDAL:  David, thank you for having me."
352,MR. GREGORY:  Up next.
353,GOV. JINDAL:  And buy the book.
354,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.  There you go.
355,"Up next, growing controversy over new airport security rules, as we've been talking about, including what many people say are invasive pat-downs.  Plus, an early look at the fight for the White House 2012, as Sarah Palin sets the stage for a possible presidential run.  Our
roundtable weighs in on it all: Robert Draper, who's written about Palin's inner circle for this morning's New York Times magazine; The Wall Street Journal's Paul Gigot; Richard Wolffe, author of the new book ""Revival,"" about the Obama administration; and incoming tea party-backed Republican congressman from Florida, Allen West."
356,(Announcements)
357,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up, our roundtable looks ahead to the fight in Congress over taxes and spending.  Plus, a 2012 preview.  Does Sarah Palin's new book set the stage for a presidential run?  After this brief commercial break."
358,(Announcements)
359,"MR. GREGORY:  We are back with our roundtable now.  Joining me, editorial page editor of The Wall Street Journal, Paul Gigot; contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine, Robert Draper--his piece is out today on Sarah Palin, the cover story of The New York Times Magazine--and the author of the new book ""Revival"" is with us, ""The Struggle for Survival Inside the Obama White House,"" Richard Wolffe; as well as incoming congressman from Florida, Republican Allen West."
360,Welcome to all of you.
361,"Congressman, let me start with you.  I mean, a, a fellow Republican, Governor Jindal, talking about the searches that we've seen around the country.  And remember as we look at some of this video that a lot of people think it's disturbing.  These are people who are making a choice
not to go through the actual machines that provide a rather revealing look at, at, at our bodies. And if they don't do that, they, they get these pat-downs.  You heard him say, clearly excessive."" Is this going to become a bigger issue in Washington?"
362,"REP.-ELECT ALLEN WEST (R-FL):  I think it may end up becoming an issue, especially when we come out of this holiday season and we see how that affects us--the travel and the, and the economy.  But I think, once again, it comes back to marketing.  I mean, we should have put out some type of feelers and talked to the American people about this before we go and implement this type of plan.  And also, when you go back, you look at after September 11, we had the opportunity with Israel coming and talking to us about improving our security screening procedures, and we turned them down.  I traveled to Israel, and I tell you what, they have
very good procedures, and you don't have to go through all of these very draconian practices."
363,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.  Well, this is the, this is the debate, Richard.  I mean, it--whether--what the Israelis do, a little bit more psychological profiling through an interview, whether there's an element of profiling. I mean, the larger question is, is there a better way here?"
364,"MR. RICHARD WOLFFE:  Well, let's just be clear, OK?  This isn't about marketing.  You know, this is about national security.  You've got a very risk-averse president who, as I explain in my book, was very unhappy with the way the Christmas Day bomber was proceeding and, and berated his national security team.  So, with respect, I don't understand why a Democratic president or a Democratic administration introduces intrusive security measures, and that's an invasion of privacy; but a Republican president can, you know, have no-fly lists, no-fly lists that take up thousands of people..."
365,"REP.-ELECT WEST:  Well, I didn't, I didn't agree, I didn't agree with that either.  But I think that one of the critical things... "
366,"MR. WOLFFE:  Well, wait a second.  Wait a second.  Wait a second."
367,"REP.-ELECT WEST:  No, listen to me.  One of the things we need to say..."
368,MR. WOLFFE:  The Republican...
369,"REP.-ELECT WEST:  ...it is about trend analysis, it is not about profiling. And I think--when I talk about marketing, I'm talking about talking to the American people about these changes in procedures."
370,"MR. GREGORY:  In setting it up.  But where does this go, Paul Gigot? Where does this debate go, do you think?"
371,MR. PAUL GIGOT:  I think the danger here is that the public begins to revolt against these kinds of security procedures.
372,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
373,"MR. GIGOT:  And then you risk losing public support not just for airport screenings, but for the whole war on terror and the whole national security regime post-9/11.  So I think we got to think very carefully whether this kind of intrusive pat-down is what we want to do.  And I
think, in the end--we've already seen them move on children. No--children under 12 now are not going to be..."
374,MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Pilots exempted now.
375,"MR. GIGOT:  That's right, pilots exempted now.  I think there's going to be some real push back here, and the administration would do well to listen or lose support more broadly."
376,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But we have to remember that--I always say, you know, the country was here after 9/11, maybe has gone down to here. "
377,MR. ROBERT DRAPER:  Sure.
378,"MR. GREGORY:  But, in terms of vigilance, could get right back up to here in a heartbeat.  All you need is another Christmas Day attempt, or another attempt that we've heard about in months after that.  And this is an effective way to deal with it, and we have to put up with some of this."
379,"MR. DRAPER:  Absolutely.  And I'm, I'm really struck listening to Congressman West of the--of how this is not so much a debate between laissez-faire, libertarian, tea party types and the Obama administration.  But a debate between them, the former group, and the former head of the Republican Party, President George W. Bush, who in the wake of 9/11 really believed that no price was too dear for security.  And so, granted, there are a lot of arguments we could make in the margins about what's working and what is not. But, but finally this is about the price that we pay to be secure."
380,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman, is there--do, do tea party candidates, or the tea party sentiment within Congress now..."
381,REP.-ELECT WEST:  Yeah.
382,"MR. GREGORY:  ...of which I think you are a part, is there going to be a battle with the, with the Republican Party on issues like this that are--become more about libertarian concerns?"
383,"REP.-ELECT WEST:  Well, I wouldn't say it's about libertarian concerns. I think that when you look at the tea party, it is about a grassroots, constitutional, conservative movement.  And one of the critical parts of that is national security.  But I think that we need to focus our efforts and focus our national security efforts, and not come up with a lot of these somewhat seemingly knee-jerk reactions that we're seeing with this pat-down procedure. And once again, I think that we need to understand--define who the enemy is, first and foremost, and then make sure that we have the security apparatus and procedures in place..."
384,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think profiling is appropriate?
385,REP.-ELECT WEST:  I don't call it profiling.
386,MR. GREGORY:  What do you call it?
387,"REP.-ELECT WEST:  Let me tell you, I call it trend analysis, because having been a commander in the battlefield, what you look for are trends, and you focus your resources on those trends.  You know, profiling has become this negative, connotative phrase.  But if we continue--and I do think, you know, from the previous administration to this administration, we have been somewhat lucky in, in the, in the thwarting of some of the attacks that we have seen. But we've got to be able to focus our security apparatus and resources."
388,"MR. GREGORY:  Richard Wolffe, let me, let me go a little bit broader here. This was a snapshot of our NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in terms of the view toward what's going to happen in Washington here between the president and Republicans.  It's a pretty, pretty dire view.
Americans think there's going to be a lot of division, a lot of gridlock, little willingness to compromise by a margin of 76 percent to 19 percent. Whether it's the START treaty or the tax cuts, what's, what's going to give here?  Are Republicans saying to the president, ""Look, the price is now a lot higher to do business with us""?"
389,"MR. WOLFFE:  They've been very explicit, haven't they?  Mitch McConnell has said he wants the president to be a one-termer.  The question is, if this plays out, especially for independent voters--if you think that independent voters are what swung the last election, where the Obama administration has lost support in the last couple of years, what do they want to see?  And now you have an alignment between Democrats and independents, they want the two sides to work together.  If the Republicans are serious about this stuff, about moving to this more libertarian side of things, whether it's on START or it's on this TSA pat-down stuff, you're going to have a serious threat for Republicans about giving up their national security credentials.  As we saw in 2004, that's a pretty risky position against an incumbent president at a time of war and terrorist threats."
390,"MR. GREGORY:  Look at the headlines, Paul Gigot, from The Hill newspaper and others about liberals in the president's party.  The Washington Times headline, ""Liberals prod Obama to show some muscle in the tax-cut battle."" ""Angry left to Obama:  Stop caving,"" that was in The Hill.  So now, I mean, the president's in a position where he probably--he realizes he's got to move a little bit on the tax cut debate, extending the Bush-era tax cuts.  But the left--and Nancy Pelosi's back as leader of the Democrats--is saying, ""Not so fast here."""
391,"MR. GIGOT:  No.  The president's interests now are separate from the Democrats on the Hill.  When you're in the minority, you're going to want to oppose everything that the Republicans in the majority do because your interests are becoming the majority again.  The president, on the other hand, and Senate Democrats, many of whom are up in 2012, have an interest in accomplishment and getting things done.  So what I think you're going to see is the president is going to have to move to the center, at least symbolically and substantively.  Symbolically, I think, in a, in a, in a tonal sense, but substantively on some issues.  And I would look for it
to happen on taxes, I would look to it to happen on some spending cuts. And Richard and the Democrats might not like this, but the truth is, he's going to have to do that if he wants to get re-elected."
392,"MR. GREGORY:  The--Congressman, the--on the issue of tax cuts, do you buy the president's argument, ""Look, let's extend those Bush-era tax cuts for the middle class first, then we can come back and do the upper earners, or at least have that conversation""?"
393,"REP.-ELECT WEST:  No.  I think that we need to extend those tax cuts permanently across the board.  Look, I come from a--an area down in South Florida where unemployment is at 13 percent, foreclosures are absolutely high. We are seeing closed upon closed storefronts.  But yet, when you walk around here in Washington, D.C., you don't see people getting laid off, you don't see, you know, anyone suffering, you don't see the foreclosures.  There is a belief that things are not going well down on Main Street, and they need to be heard.  There is a belief that it has to start from up here with the right type of cuts in the spending, the right
type of cuts in the growth of government.  So I think it's so important that we understand that we have to invigorate the, the growth of this country, the long-term, sustainable growth of this country, which comes from our small businesses and comes from our corporate business growth."
394,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Well, leadership moment here.  Look at some of the responses to the deficit commission and whether folks are uncomfortable with some of the proposals.  Look at our polling and what it finds, pretty big numbers.  Seventy percent uncomfortable with cuts in
spending for Medicare, Social Security and defense.  Fifty-nine percent uncomfortable with increased taxes, eliminating some deductions. Fifty-seven percent uncomfortable raising the Social Security retirement age to 69 over the next 60 years.  Is it--does all that have to be on the table for you as a freshman congressman coming in, all those cuts on the table?"
395,"REP.-ELECT WEST:  I, I think everything has to be on the table.  I think that we need to have an honest conversation with the American people. And I think that when you look at some of the things up here with the, the public sector compensation--you know, we could find about $47 billion if we aligned government compensation with private sector.  We need to look at our Defense Department.  We need to look at, you know, how do we, you know, reform--not reform, but how do we repair Social Security?  How do we get Social Security back into that independent trust fund account? We need to look at how do we set the conditions economically so maybe we have less people that have to be on Social Security, Medicare and
Medicaid?  And I think that's one of the critical challenges we have to make going into this 112th Congress. "
396,"MR. GREGORY:  Richard, do you see the president advocating for some of this, this tough medicine here?"
397,MR. WOLFFE:  I...
398,"MR. GREGORY:  I mean, if the commission was political cover, I don't know. It doesn't look like a lot of cover yet."
399,"MR. WOLFFE:  I think he was serious about the deficit stuff.  You know, one of the stories I tell in ""Revival"" is how they had to game out whether or not they would get any Republicans at all to get on this deficit commission. That's how bad the politics of this are.  But the
president's talked about the deficit a lot.  He, he knows that's what voters care about.  This is a moment when he can actually say to these incoming members of Congress, ""You talk about the deficit, but if you take taxes off the table, how are you going to be serious about doing
that?  That's not a reasonable discussion."" His position, his natural default, is to say, ""The left is over here, the radical right's over there, I'm the serious grown-up in the middle."" That's where he's got to play this deficit."
400,"MR. GREGORY:  Is there a grand bargain that's possible, either one of you, with regard to taxes and spending, that they're both part of an equation?"
401,"MR. DRAPER:  I mean, I, I think on taxes, it's a, it's a politically winning argument for the Republicans to say let's keep the Bush tax cuts. But as Richard is saying, it presents President Obama with an opportunity to say, ""You've just left $300 billion of, of a way of lopping off the deficit.  You, you've left that off the table, so show me something that's worth $300 billion."" You can't say earmark reform, that's $18 billion, that's chicken feed."
402,MR. WOLFFE:  Right.
403,"MR. GIGOT:  But beyond that, beyond the Bush tax cuts and extending those, which I think won't happen for at least two years, the real opportunity for bipartisan agreement I--here, I think, is tax reform."
404,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
405,MR. GIGOT:  And you saw the reaction to the deficit commission proposal to lower the top rates...
406,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
407,"MR. GIGOT:  ...lower the rates and the corporate rate to as low as 23 percent at one option.  And then you broaden the base, giving up certain deductions, which would be hard to do, but I think both parties see that this as a possibility to get together.  I don't know if it'll happen in
the next two years, but I think this is something--and you saw it in the reaction.  The Republican reaction to this, from Paul Ryan and Jeb Hensarling and others, was, ""Let's talk about this."" And Nancy Pelosi said, ""No way.  We can't talk about it."""
408,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Let's...
409,MR. GIGOT:  But the president has an interest in doing so.
410,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me take a break here.  We're going to do that, we're going to come back, talk about the battleground 2012.  The campaign's already started, whether we like it or not, and we'll talk about specifically the ""Sarah Palin effect."" Some news on that this morning,
thanks to Mr. Draper. Our roundtable continues right after this. "
411,(Announcements)
412,"MR. GREGORY:  We are back.  I want to talk about the battleground 2012.  I thought Governor Jindal said he doesn't want to be president yet.  Didn't rule out being on a ticket in 2012.  And when you write a book like ""Leadership in Crisis,"" I think you're positioning yourself, but we'll
put that out there. "
413,"Let's talk about Sarah Palin.  Here is The New York Times Magazine that folks are waking up to around the country, and on the cover, ""The Palin Network: How the GOP's Leading Shadow Candidate Runs Her Guerilla Organization."""
414,"Robert Draper, you wrote this piece.  You talked to her.  A portion of this is from your interview with Governor Palin.  She says this, ""I know that a hurdle I would have to cross, that some other potential candidates wouldn't have to cross right out of the chute, is proving my record.
That's the most frustrating thing for me - the warped and perverted description of my record and what I've accomplished over the last two decades.  It's been much more perplexing to me than where the lamestream media has wanted to go about my personal life.  And other candidates haven't faced these criticisms the way I have."" Her record does matter. Her ability to be seen, as Karl Rove says in his piece in The Wall Street Journal this week, can folks look at her and imagine her in the Oval Office?"
415,MR. DRAPER:  Well...
416,MR. GREGORY:  She's not there yet.
417,"MR. DRAPER:  That's the big question.  I mean, what she was referring to was her record as governor of Alaska. But I don't think that moves the needle on her approval ratings.  I mean, I think that, that, you know, the, the question that she's going to have to answer is, if ""commonsense conservatism"" is shorthand for ""I haven't learned the issues."" And, and, you know, she has done more to close the substance deficit.  I mean, her--she's had increasingly wonkish speeches.  But yeah, there's this cognitive dissonance of seeing her climbing a glacier.  It's kind of a cool visual, but is that the same visual of being in the Oval Office?  I
mean, she's got a ways to go on that."
418,"MR. GREGORY:  She, she spoke, as well, in this new show that she's got on TLC, five million viewers, an interesting clip from her reality show.  I want to show that."
419,(Videotape)
420,"MS. SARAH PALIN:  You know, having every word, every action scrutinized and, in some cases, mocked, I can handle it.  I, you know, I kind of have asked for it, right?"
421,(End videotape)
422,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman, it is interesting.  I mean, she's certainly out there in the arena.  Look, she endorsed you. "
423,REP.-ELECT WEST:  Yes.
424,MR. GREGORY:  What kind of impact did that have?  And what is your assessment of her strength after the midterms?
425,"REP.-ELECT WEST:  Well, I have to tell you this, right now I haven't even been sworn in, so I think the most important thing we need to be focused on is, how do we take care of the problems that are facing this country? Because if we don't do that, if this Republican Congress and the House of Representatives does not do that, it does not matter who you put up for
president..."
426,MR. GREGORY:  Fair enough.
427,REP.-ELECT WEST:  ...in 2012.
428,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
429,"REP.-ELECT WEST:  So that's what the people are looking for.  Now, I will tell you this, you know, she did endorse me with four other military candidates back in March of this year.  It was good to have her endorsement because she does have a, a reach to the grassroots movement, but it is also incumbent upon me to be able to, once I get that trust and confidence, to come up here and prove myself worthy of what the people have shown.  But this is also important:  The, the world is Machiavellian, not so much Kantian, and the next president of the United States has to understand that there are wolves out there.  And the next president of the United States is going to have to sit down at a table and stare down some very tough customers."
430,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
431,REP.-ELECT WEST:  And I think that's the number one criteria we need to be thinking about as we move forward.
432,"MR. GREGORY:  It's interesting, Richard Wolffe, if you look, Ron Brownstein has written some about this for the National Journal, the idea that there are some similarities, if you look at the, the landscape on the right of how a candidate Palin could draw votes away from a Mitt
Romney or another candidate that, that he describes it as a ""beer-wine track phenomenon."" But in other words, the working class white voters, in the way that Hillary Clinton got those voters in her primary fight with Obama, that that's the space that she could occupy as well."
433,MR. WOLFFE:  Right.  But her basic problem is that she has a 35 percent approval rating among independents.
434,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
435,"MR. WOLFFE:  When you start that that low among a group that has essentially decided every election in recent memory, you've got a huge problem, a mountain to climb.  And combine that with the popularity of the grass roots among the primary voters in the Republican party, it's a
dynamic that is going to tear this thing apart.  And it reminds me of Howard Dean.  I covered Howard Dean in 2004.  Strong grassroots support, people looked at the numbers and said he's not going to make it.  I think that's one of the reasons why Sarah Palin did well in the House level, but not so well in the Senate race.  I mean, her Senate-backed candidates did not perform well and that's because the wider appeal is not there. "
436,"MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.  She's going to shake things up, though, for Iowa, that's for sure."
437,"MR. GIGOT:  Well, I--well, I think so, if she does decide to run. Politics, though, is additive, as Richard points out.  You've got to build on your base. I think the field is wide open, the Republican field, and I think she has a chance to get the, to get the nomination if she runs.  She has a lot of likeability, people really think that--they love her sincerity.  She comes across as real, not practiced, not canned.  But she does have to make the case to people that she can do the job.  She has to look presidential, and that will--and particularly, to people in the suburbs around Philadelphia and the suburbs.  Republicans did very well in Wisconsin, for example."
438,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
439,MR. GIGOT:  How are you going to make the sale to those swing voters and independents?  You want a state like that.
440,"MR. GREGORY:  What did you learn about how the Palin world operates, though, that is clearly unconventional and is not following any script? I mean, if Republicans are known for the next one in line and a lot of order..."
441,MR. DRAPER:  Sure.  Yeah.
442,MR. GREGORY:  ...this is--she's not playing with that script.
443,"MR. DRAPER:  It is the polar opposite of, say, the Bush organization of 2004. I mean, it's people playing outside their lanes.  No one has a title.  People essentially do what's in front of them.  And Paul and I were discussing it before, I mean, there's--it's--those of us in the media who tried to reach out to the Palin organization are faced with, you know, endless delays and, and often pocket vetoing.  And, and, and it is not an organization that can any way transfer itself to a campaign structure.  Palin herself recognizes that. She said as much to me.  But the question is, will she be able to bring in people whom she trusts, who are capable of doing this sort of thing.  Trust is a huge issue with the Palins.  They feel like they were really burned in 2008. And the question is, how much of an informing characteristic will that be going forward?"
444,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We're going to take another break here, quickly. We'll come back.  We'll have some final thoughts in just a moment from our roundtable.  Don't go away."
445,(Announcements)
446,"MR. GREGORY:  We're back with our roundtable.  Some closing thoughts. Richard Wolffe, the book is ""Revival."" How does the White House, how does the president think about the road to recovery politically right now? "
447,"MR. WOLFFE:  Well, for a start, there's a reason, one of the reasons I called it ""Revival"" is because 10 months ago this guy was written off for dead. Health care was dead.  He was finished.  Two months later, he gets health care and, incidentally, a treaty with the Russians.  It's happened time and again. Through the primaries, when Sarah Palin was nominated,
this guy was over. There is something of the comeback about him, and they're hoping it's going to happen again.  How does he do it?  He's got to get back to where he was in 2008, the change guy, change the way business is done.  If he's just another inside Washington politician, he's going to be in trouble."
448,"MR. GREGORY:  But everybody I talk to, Congressman, says this is not somebody who tacks to the center, doesn't play small ball, was not a tactical player. And that, that becomes a choice for him, just as conservatives have a choice about how they want to use this power they've
got."
449,"REP.-ELECT WEST:  Absolutely.  And I think the critical thing is to look at the first 90 to 120 days.  What is the relationship between the House GOP, the Senate, and the administration?  I think you have to look and see what is going to be the impact of this incredible freshman class
that's coming in that's one-third of the House GOP.  I think it was very--the historical metaphor I use comparing Nancy Pelosi being brought back in as minority leader, Pickett's charge.  I mean, if we had given Picket another division and told him to go and try it again.  So I think that those three things are going to be the interesting dynamics."
450,MR. GREGORY:  What is your mandate as you come to town?  What is your mandate?
451,"REP.-ELECT WEST:  My mandate is to listen to the American people, the people that sent us up here.  And the mandate is to do something about the, the growth of government, the, the spending of government, and get back to a constitutional based principle of governance."
452,"MR. GREGORY:  Paul Gigot, quickly, do Republicans have a mandate to actually cooperate at some level.  Do they have something?  Do they need something tangible at this point?"
453,"MR. GIGOT:  I think they do need something tangible on taxes, and I think in terms of spending cuts.  They need to show a reduction in the growth of government.  I don't think they need to get a huge, all encompassing budget deal, but they need to show that they're attempting to do that in the House."
454,MR. GREGORY:  Right.  And are they willing to...
455,MR. GIGOT:  Put that on the table in the House.
456,MR. GREGORY:  Are they willing to advocate really draconian cuts in the face of the headwinds here?
457,MR. DRAPER:  This is what interests me.
458,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
459,"MR. DRAPER:  I will be very curious to see.  You know, we've been hearing a mantra from a lot of the incoming freshman about blowing up the appropriations process from the inside.  So I'll be very curious to see if they actually do that or if they succumb to the temptation, when some of them seated on the Appropriations Committee, to throw that money around for pet projects for their constituents. "
460,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We are going to leave it there.  Thank you all very much.
461,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Before we go, a little piece of history.  In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the election of John F. Kennedy, NBC News has launched JFK:  50 Days, an iPad app that highlights 50 select moments from Kennedy's presidency.  The app combines text and NBC News archival video, some not seen in 50 years, if ever at all."
462,"That's all for today.  We wish you all and your family a very happy Thanksgiving.  We'll be back next week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, back to work for the president and Congress. But what'll actually get done in a lame duck session?  Will debate begin on the new START treaty with Russia?  Who will win the battle over extension of the Bush-era tax cuts?  And will the debt
commission's ideas for slashing the deficit go anywhere?  Plus, will North Korea's deadly attack against the south engage U.S. armed forces into another combat zone after the north warns that a planned U.S.-South Korean military exercise that began hours ago could put the region on the brink of war.

5,"Then, as the post-election political battles heat up, battleground 2012 is already taking shape.  Who are the potential candidates to watch? And which issues will matter most?  Our political roundtable weighs in:  The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne; The Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan; plus, former counselor to President Bush, Ed Gillespie; and Philadelphia mayor, Democrat Michael Nutter."
6,Transcript & resource archive
7,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
8,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
9,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Just hours ago, those planned U.S.-South Korean joint  military exercises began in the waters south of the disputed maritime boundary with North Korea.  Joining me now live from Seoul, South Korea, with the very latest on these escalating tensions, NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel."
10,"Richard, what is your sense on the ground there?  Is this about to get worse before it gets better?"
11,RICHARD ENGEL reporting:
12,"There are mixed indications.  People here, in what is a very snowy Seoul, South Korea, don't seem like they want a war.  But all of the pieces are in place for a very, very dangerous situation.  You have American military hardware that has been brought into the region. These joint exercises now under way, which the North Korean government is perceiving as a direct threat. And now, according to North Korean officials, North Korea has positioned surface-to-air missiles near to its coast, it has moved other kinds of longer range missiles onto launch pads.  It has also stationed and gotten ready some anti-ship missiles.  So it wouldn't take much for this crisis here, which is just at a rhetoric stage for now, to escalate dramatically further, David."
13,"MR. GREGORY:  What do you think North Korea actually wants?  I mean, the Chinese, who've stepped up now, saying there should be some emergency talks, that's probably what the administration wanted to have happen. But how do you read North Korea and its desires here?"
14,"MR. ENGEL:  Analysts we've spoken to here believe this has to do with domestic politics inside North Korea.  North Korea clearly wants attention, it wants to re-engage in those nuclear discussions, but it also has an issue of transition that it is dealing with.  The North
Korean dictator is--had a stroke, he's ill, and he's trying to pass on authority to his 27-year-old son. Just last September the son was promoted to a four-star general position.  Now the son, according to officials here, has to prove that he is a military man, that he can handle this situation.  So, if you look at it from the way it's viewed here, people are saying this is a war designed and being carried out for the benefit of a 27-year--27-year-old ""little prince."""
15,"MR. GREGORY:  Before I let you go, Richard, the country here is poised for more WikiLeaks documents, more secret government documents being released by that Web site WikiLeaks, with regard to U.S. relationships with--key relationships around the glode.  How, how--globe, rather.  How bad is this going to be?"
16,"MR. ENGEL:  This is devastating.  I've spoken to many senior U.S. military officials, and they believe that this is--well, they use words like treason, they use words like a major breech of American national security.  And they wonder how the, the chief suspect accused of leaking
these documents to WikiLeaks, a, a private first class, could have managed to do this, to bring out hundreds of thousands of first military cables, now diplomatic correspondences, internal documents that are supposed to be just within the, within the ranks of politicians and
diplomats and embassies.  How such a low-level person within the U.S. military could have passed this on to a foreign agent who is now putting them online."
17,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
18,"MR. ENGEL:  This is a major breech, and a lot of people are wondering will there be an overhaul, a, a re-examination on how America's protected information is kept secure."
19,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, Richard Engel for us in Seoul, South Korea.  I appreciate your reporting this morning, Richard. "
20,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Joining me now live from Springfield, Illinois, assistant majority leader, Democratic senator Dick Durbin; and from Phoenix this morning, assistant minority leader, Republican senator Jon Kyl."
21,"Welcome to both of you.  A lot to get to, both foreign and domestic. Let's start with North Korea."
22,"Senator Kyl, how, how does this end?  And what should the president do about it?"
23,"SEN. JON KYL (R-AZ):  Well, I don't know how it ends, obviously.  But what we ought to do is what we're doing right now, and that is not backing down in terms of having very legitimate exercises with the South Korean government, which we had, had--gave plenty of advance notice of. And, and then see how it, how it plays out.  Obviously, we're not trying to provoke anything there. But with news--the IAEA from the United Nations just released a report a couple of weeks ago detailing how North Korea was proliferating nuclear technology to Iran and Syria.  And clearly this is a country that needs to be dealt with, and I think we need to focus a lot more on it."
24,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator Durbin, how?  The New York Times on Saturday had this headline, ""China Addresses Rising Korean Tensions, but With a Warning to the U.S."" They want to tamp down what's happening, they now want emergency talks, but they're the real power player here in terms of leverage over North Korea.  Do they ultimately have to deal with North Korea, rather than the United States?"
25,"SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL):  I spoke with Secretary of State Clinton last night about this, and we both agree that China can play a very valuable role here in trying to bring under control a situation which is very volatile.  At this point in time we need to make certain we stand as one
nation, strong in our alliance with South Korea, determined to stop this effort by North Korea to provoke aggression.  This sort of thing, I think, really calls on us to be more bipartisan, more constructive in our efforts in Washington."
26,"MR. GREGORY:  But should, should any attack on South Korea be viewed as an attack on the United States, Senator Durbin?"
27,SEN. DURBIN:  I'm not going to go any further than what the president has said.  We have a strong alliance with South Korea.  We will stand by them.  It is a treaty obligation that goes back over 50 years.  
28,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
29,"Senator Kyl, let's move on to the very contentious issue of this START treaty that you're in the center of.  This is the nuclear arms reduction treaty that the administration has negotiated with Russia, that the president said is a priority for this lame-duck session.  You seem to be
the key player here as the opponent here in the Senate.  You've said, over the past couple of weeks, ""I think there is no chance that the START treaty can be completed in the lame-duck session."" Is that still your view?"
30,"SEN. KYL:  It is, and it's more a view of reality rather than policy.  If the leader of the Senate, Senator Reid, were to allow a couple of weeks for full debate and amendment of the resolution of ratification, then theoretically there would be time.  But he has made it clear that he has
a different agenda in mind.  And I, I think clearly they've got to set some priorities here.  Are they going to deal with the funding of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year?  They've got to do that. Are they going to deal with the issue which is on everybody's mind, that you mentioned earlier, and that is to ensure that we don't have a big tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of the country.  These are higher priority items.  And if we do those things and then potentially deal with some of the other political issues that Senator
Reid has said he wants to deal with, in that event then there would not be time to do a START treaty as well."
31,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but, Senator Durbin, here's the issue.  Do you--can you get around Senator Kyl?  Do you have the votes?  You need nine... "
32,SEN. DURBIN:  Well...
33,MR. GREGORY:  ...votes among Republicans.  Can you get there without him?
34,"SEN. DURBIN:  I can tell you that when it comes to this issue, we respect Jon Kyl.  I think he's worked as hard as any other senator, maybe more than any senator, to understand this issue and to be an important part of the policy decisions that we face.  But here is the reality.  We live in a dangerous world.  The failure of the United States Senate to ratify the START treaty immediately is going to pose a danger to the United States and its security. And let me give a historical analogy.  It wasn't that long ago that a Republican president appealed to Congress on a bipartisan basis--it was President George W.  Bush after 9/11--to rewrite the architecture of our intelligence agencies with a new Department of Homeland Security.  Senator Susan Collins, the chairman of the committee at that time and a Republican, Senator Joe Lieberman, a Democrat, got together and did it.  They constructed this new scenario that has made us
safer as a nation and they did it during a lame-duck session.  There is no excuse for us to, to ignore this responsibility and to say we'll wait several months."
35,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, Senator..."
36,SEN. DURBIN:  While we wait there will be no one--there'll be no inspectors on the ground in Russia to make sure that their nuclear weapons are safe and treaty-compliant.
37,"MR. GREGORY:  The issue is, is, Senator Kyl, what do you need all the time for?  The New York Times reported this on Friday about your role, ""Privately, administration officials expressed anger and bewilderment at Mr.  Kyl, contending that they had given him virtually everything he
sought.  Arms control advocates have been more vocal.  `My conclusion is' that `he's acting in bad faith,' said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association.  `He asked for more earlier in the fall and they've delivered.'"" Is this anything other than trying to snub the
president, Senator?"
38,"SEN. KYL:  Of course.  Let me reiterate what I said before.  Harry Reid, the leader of the Senate, can bring the START treaty up anytime he wants to, but he has a different agenda.  He's made some promises to some political constituencies.  He wants to do the Dream Act in order to appeal to certain segments of the Hispanic community.  The ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy to appeal to the gay and lesbian community.  To appeal to the unions, he wants to do the so-called firefighters federal unionization bill.  In addition to various political commitments that he's made to do legislation in the lame duck session, we have to fund the government for the remaining 10 months of the fiscal year.  We have to deal with some expiring provisions like..."
39,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator, you're not being responsive.  What's your... "
40,"SEN. KYL:  May I just finish, David?"
41,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, what's your issue?"
42,SEN. KYL:  David!
43,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, what's your issue with the treaty?"
44,"SEN. KYL:  As I told you, my issue is that you can't do everything.  I was stating it as a matter of reality, not a matter of policy.  How can Harry Reid do all of the things we've talked about, deal with the expiring tax provisions and, in addition to that, deal with the START treaty, which by itself could probably take at least two weeks? "
45,MR. GREGORY:  How long did the last START treaty take to ratify?
46,SEN. KYL:  We...
47,MR. GREGORY:  How much debate?
48,"SEN. KYL:  We, we have three weeks to go before the Christmas recess, and there are, in my opinion, a lot of amendments that have to be raised on this treaty.  And as a result colleagues are going to offer those amendments.  Is Harry Reid just going to shut it off and say, ""We only
have three days""?"
49,"MR. GREGORY:  I'm sorry, Senator, my question is, how long did the last START treaty take to, to get through Congress?"
50,"SEN. KYL:  It's not comparable to this START treaty.  The last START treaty was a three-page document.  It was agreed to by virtually every--in fact, I think the vote was unanimous, or maybe there was one dissenting vote.  That's not going to be the case with this treaty, in
which there are a lot of issues."
51,MR. GREGORY:  Senator Durbin.
52,"SEN. DURBIN:  Well, I can just tell you that we've--people across America, who subscribe to cable, ask for refunds when they turn on C-Span and see the Senate sit there day after day doing nothing, lurching from filibuster to filibuster.  Come on, let's be reasonable, let's be
constructive, let's be bipartisan.  We can get these things done.  Let's roll up our sleeves and do it.  Senator Kyl has raised legitimate issues, but the fact is, we can do all of the things he mentioned, debate them and vote on them in a responsible way before we break for Christmas.  To do otherwise is really to create a dangerous situation.  I agree with
Senator Richard Lugar.  It is time for us to step up as a nation and face the reality that we will be safer with the START treaty.  And I might say to Senator Kyl, consider the situation in Iran. They just announced yesterday that they were going to fire up their nuclear reactor.  If it's
for peaceful domestic purposes, all well and good.  But if it's part of an agenda to build a nuclear weapon, it's a danger to the world. Russia has helped us in dealing with this threat in Iran.  To ignore and push aside the START treaty at this moment does not help our relationship with Russia in this critical issue of an Iranian nuclear program."
53,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Kyl, I just want to zero in on one point to which I don't feel like I've gotten an answer to, which is, substantively--and by the way the old START treaty took a matter of days, you say it's not comparable, but that is the reality that it doesn't take three weeks necessarily.  But what, substantively, are you not getting from the White House that you want, to say, ""Yes, I can support this""?"
54,"SEN. KYL:  First of all, let me quote The Washington Post, which directly addressed the question that you asked.  ""No calamity will befall the United States if the Senate does not act this year."" And in response to the charge that somehow we need to do this for the urgency of needing verification, the Associated Press did a fact check on that allegation and said, ""The urgency is political.  Even the administration concedes the security risk is not immediate."" So there is not a time pressure to do this now as opposed to two months from now.  But specifically to your question, there are a series of issues that relate, first off all, to provisions of the treaty itself and how it deals with missile defense and conventional prompt global strike and some other issues.  Secondly, you have the question of modernization, which is the thing that Senator Durbin pointed out that I had been primarily focused on. And third, you have questions extraneous to the treaty but within the context, which is, is this all that's standing between us today and the administration trying to negotiate even deeper, further cuts, which it's indicated that it wants to do in its march toward global zero, something that a lot of
us disagree with.  So there are a lot of considerations, and if you would like just one or two very specific, one of the things the administration has done with regard to building our nuclear complex back up, replacing the old Manhattan era 1940s buildings, for example, facilities, is to
create two new buildings which are going to be necessary, one in Tennessee, one in New Mexico. And these buildings are very costly.  But what they've done is to stretch out the cost so that it doesn't show up in the 10-year projections now to be completed by the year 2023 and 2024. That's too long.  We need those facilities before then.  And, as a result, there probably will be amendments or at least an effort to try to get the administration to fund those a little earlier.  Every year we delay is a cost of $200 million, money that could be saved if we can get those facilities constructed a little bit earlier."
55,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, let me--I want to move on to some of the domestic agenda and some of the showdowns on matters like taxes and spending.  But first, we were coming off of this holiday weekend and there was so much drama around the TSA screening procedures, the invasive pat-downs at the airport."
56,"Senator Durbin, is this debate over?  I mean, does the administration need to, to come up with a better way to secure Americans at airports from potential plots involving airplanes?"
57,"SEN. DURBIN:  Listen, we want to respect people's privacy.  But the bottom line is, when you get on an airplane with your family, you want to know this government has done everything in its power to keep us safe. Look at what happened.  After all of this furor about the pat-down and the screening and so forth, a grand total of about one percent of passengers across America during this Thanksgiving holiday season basically objected to the process that they were being offered.  One percent.  And we were tied in knots over this.  It is not an easy
assignment to TSA to say, ""Keep us safe, but don't go too far."" I think they're trying to strike the right balance.  Congress needs to continue to ask questions, but the bottom line is we want to be safe when we get on airplanes.  We do not want an air disaster because we have gone too far in bending towards some public opinion poll."
58,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator Kyl, critics have pointed out two things. One, longer security lines are an area of vulnerability for passengers if terrorists were to strike at the actual security line.  You know, and this is indelicate, but, I mean, there are also ways to hide explosives on one's person that even these more invasive security procedures are not
going to deal with.  Is there a better way?"
59,"SEN. KYL:  I think there are some other things that can be done in ddition to what's being done now, and that is to focus more on the erson than on the weapon.  This is what other countries do.  They, they profile, not on the base, of course, of race or ethnicity or religion, but on the basis of who looks like they may need a second screening. There are questions asked in other countries that tip people off, who are experienced questioners of people that need an addition screening.  We need to share better intelligence.  The Customs Department, for example,
has much better intelligence than TSA, and they need to share that with them."
60,"There's an opportunity for pre-screening for a lot of people that don't need to be screened every time because they submit in advance to an eye scan or fingerprint, have their backgrounds checked and so on.  In other words, there are a lot of things that could be done to reduce the impact. There are about 60,000 people every day, traveling, that get this pat-down procedure.  One that--just one other thing, Dick mentioned Susan Collins.  We were in the Netherlands right after the Christmas bomber from last year came over.  And, and what they do there is use a scanner which uses a mannequin, a woman and a man figure, not a stick figure, but like a mannequin, so that the image that comes up is not of your body or
my body, but just of a mannequin..."
61,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
62,"SEN. KYL:  ...but it shows whatever we have on the body.  It's just a matter of software, and TSA says they're looking at it.  And I think there are a lot of other things we can do that might enable them to back off of patting down, you know, the old saying, ""little old ladies and kids."""
63,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, let me get to a few other issues."
64,"Senator Durbin, President Obama will finally sit down with Republican leaders, incoming Speaker Boehner and McConnell--as well as Senator McConnell, when he comes back to Washington.  He's in Washington, but when he meets with them this coming week.  How should he approach this meeting, and specifically on the issue of, of Bush tax cuts and whether they're going to be extended?  Is he, is he in a mind to compromise at this point?"
65,"SEN. DURBIN:  I think--I don't want to speak for the White House, but I think their position is one, at least, that I share initially, and that is that we ought to say to the vast majority of America's middle income and working families, ""Your tax cuts are going to be protected
permanently."" That, I think, is the starting point to say to America, ""Let's move forward in a positive way."" There are a lot of areas of debate, and I'm sure Senator Kyl will raise some of his concerns as well. But we need to do this in a way that is responsible.  I'm a member of the deficit commission.  It's one of the toughest assignments I've ever had.  It worries me--this one basic thing worries me.  All of the cuts that we are proposing in the deficit commission for the next 10 years equal the Republican proposal in tax cuts.  In other words, if the Republicans go forward with tax cuts they want, Senator McConnell's package, and we make all of the spending cuts that are proposed in the deficit commission, we'll still have the same basic debt and deficit. We'll still be borrowing 40 cents out of every dollar that we spend.  We'll still be
indebted to China. "
66,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Senator Durbin, I understand the position, but what's the reality?  Do you see the president and Democrats here agreeing to an extension of Bush-era tax cuts at the upper level and the middle class level for at least a year, on a temporary basis?"
67,"SEN. DURBIN:  Well, I think we need to sit down.  We haven't done that yet. And maybe this meeting with the president will kick it off.  But I want to put a couple of other things on the table.  We do have unemployment running out. By Christmas, two million Americans will lose
their unemployment benefits because they expire, 127,000 of them here in my home state of Illinois.  I also want to make sure the earned income tax credit, the child care tax credit, and the making work pay tax credit are part of this conversation.  We should be focusing on what it takes to move this economy forward.  We should not be worried about the discomfort of the wealthy, but the fact that there are many people struggling to survive every day now because they have no job and no means to keep their family together in very difficult times."
68,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Kyl, are we seeing the, the outlines of a negotiation strategy here, which is, if Republicans are going to extend jobless benefits and insurance for those without a job, that maybe there'd be some negotiating room on tax cuts?"
69,"SEN. KYL:  Sure.  All of the things Dick mentioned are things that have to be done, and that's what I was trying to say earlier.  We have a lot on our plate to, to do before Christmas rolls around here.  And all of these things need to be, need to be done.  But let me make something very clear.  Nobody is talking about tax cuts.  We've had the rates in existence now for 10 years.  All Republicans are saying is keep them in place, don't raise taxes on anyone. The job creators in this country are the ones that would be hurt the most by an increase in taxes.  And so our position is, let's extend all of the current rates for some period of time.  Obviously, we'd like to do it permanently, but if it's three or four years, that's fine, too.  I think there is an opportunity for us to sit down and negotiate a resolution of this that's good for the economy
and, and frankly, good for everybody else. "
70,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Kyl, could, could you, could you support doing it for the middle class tax cuts, extending those first and then maybe coming back after the first of the year and taking up the question of upper earners?"
71,"SEN. KYL:  Our position, the Republican position is, and I think we're pretty unanimous on this is that there should be no tax increase on anybody, particularly in this time of very difficult economic difficulties for people in all parts of the country, and especially for the job creators, the small business folks, who would get hurt the most by a tax increase.  They're the ones who create the, the job opportunities and, frankly, represent about 25 percent of all of the workers in the country.  They don't need their taxes raised and, frankly, that can be done in this lame-duck session if we have the time to do it, we sit down and work it out, and focus our priorities there rather then on some of the other things that I mentioned earlier."
72,"MR. GREGORY:  But that's a no, you would not, you would not vote for a middle class tax cut extension if did not include, did not include upper earners?"
73,SEN. KYL:  We don't believe taxes should be increased on anyone.  Those so-called upper earners that you're talking about are the very small business folks that I'm talking about.
74,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Final question, Senator Kyl and Senator Durbin, you can comment on this.  Senator McConnell's talked about the number one goal of Republicans being to ensure that President Obama is removed from office after his first term.  Is that really the accomplishment that you think about Republicans achieving here as they have more power in
Washington?"
75,"SEN. KYL:  Senator McConnell was talking about a political goal. Obviously, President Obama has as a political goal his re-election, so there's no big surprise there.  What I talked about at the very beginning when you first talked--asked me about what could be done before Christmas was the agenda that the American people want us to focus on.  Keep the government operating, deal with the unemployment extension that Senator Durbin talked about, deal with the, with the tax system, make sure we don't have a tax increase, as we've been talking about here.  Those are the things that, that we need the most, and I think if we do work in a spirit of good will, we can achieve it.  But I would just note, here's a headline.  It doesn't look like Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, is going to be too encouraging of Dick Durbin and I sitting down together and trying to work these things out."
76,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator Durbin, you know this president well.  You encouraged him to run for the presidency.  As he faces the after-effects of a very difficult midterm election, what is your feeling about what political recovery looks like for him?"
77,"SEN. DURBIN:  Well, I can tell you that the, the president's meeting with the leaders, Democrats and Republicans, in the White House on Tuesday. It's the beginning, I hope, of a very constructive approach.  I don't know what Senator McConnell's message was from the last election on November 2nd.  He said publicly that his goal now was to make sure Obama
was not re-elected as president.  I don't think that's the message.  I think what the American people said was, ""Be reasonable.  Be constructive."" Let's try to focus on the big issues that count, getting eight million Americans back to work, dealing with two wars and the men
and women who are fighting them, their families at home; doing things that are basic to make sure this country moves forward in a positive way. Reliving and rehashing the political food fights of the past, not acceptable.  And this notion that we don't have enough time in three
weeks to take up three or four issues, the American people basically look at us and say, ""For goodness sakes, we go to work every single day.  We have to get work done every day.  Why won't the Senate do the same thing?"" I think we can, but we need a much more positive and constructive approach.  The president is going to bring us together on Tuesday in an
effort to initiate that, and I think that was truly the message of the last election."
78,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We are going to leave it there.  Senators, thank you both very much."
79,"Coming up next, President Obama's leadership, and looking ahead to battleground 2012 and the race for the White House.  Who are the potential candidates to watch?  Our political roundtable weighs in:  The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne; The Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan; plus former counselor to President Bush, Ed Gillespie; and Philadelphia Mayor Michael
Nutter."
80,(Announcements)
81,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Coming up, battleground 2010 is already taking shape. Who are the potential candidates to watch?  Which issues will matter most? Our political roundtable weighs in after this brief commercial break."
82,(Announcements)
83,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We're back with our political roundtable.  Joining me on this holiday weekend:  The Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan; The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne; former chairman of the Republican National Committee and counselor to President Bush, Ed Gillespie; and Philadelphia mayor, Democrat Michael Nutter."
84,Welcome to all of you.  Hope you had a great holiday.
85,MR. ED GILLESPIE:  Thank you.
86,"MR. E.J. DIONNE:  Thank you, David."
87,MS. PEGGY NOONAN:  Great.
88,MR. GREGORY:  It's great to have you here.
89,"Mayor Nutter, it's interesting.  I went back--I want to talk, before we get to the 2012 discussion, about the president's leadership overall, because I think it's such an important topic.  I--based on my reporting, I've said, you know, the left is disappointed, the middle's disaffected, and the right is resurgent.  It's a difficult landscape for him to deal with.  And you said something that--to Politico back in 2008 that I think is revealing, if you think about it now.  ""Nutter says Obama, still basking in the glow of a mandate victory, must be straight with people in tough times."
90,"""`You have to manage expectations,' he said.  `I jokingly said I was elected mayor, not monarch.  When you are elected, you are not given a magic wand to make everything better instantly.  I think people have been realistic and supportive that it may take a little while to create the change that we're talking about in Philadelphia, or the change Obama's talking about across the country.'"
91,"""The only way for the president-elect to even come close to making that change happen, said Nutter, is to remind the public that he does not walk on water."" Well, you know, he's come out--come off a terrible midterm election.  He certainly doesn't walk on water.  Is he managing
expectations the way that you said he should?"
92,"MAYOR MICHAEL NUTTER:  Well, first, David, none of us walk on water.  And there is a harsh reality to this economy that people are in pain, people are upset, people are angry, they are frustrated, all of those things and more. So managing expectations certainly is a big part of the job.  But he's been in the job less than two years."
93,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
94,"MAYOR NUTTER:  It took a long time to get where we're going.  And when you--people ignore all the things that have happened--financial recovery, economic recovery package, health care, civil rights, and a number of other steps and investments that President Obama has taken, all of which gets washed almost to the side by the daily doom and gloom that people read in the newspapers, see on TV, or are experiencing themselves.  And so it's a--it's tough to break through all of that.  The president has done a great job over his time.  Any of us could do better, I think he's acknowledged that any number of times.  But managing expectations is a big part of this job."
95,"MR. GREGORY:  But it's also leadership, Peggy Noonan.  Where are his leadership moments?  Where is he connected with the American public? Where do they maintain faith in him?  It's worth pointing out, when he meets with Republican leaders he will be the most popular political
figure in the room, which still stands for something.  But he faces a lot of challenges."
96,"MS. NOONAN:  He does.  I think the way to get beyond the trouble he is in now, the way to show responsiveness, to show he is in touch with the feeling of the American people is to act as if the 2010 election happened, do you know what I mean?  A big message was sent in that big wave.  Don't make believe it didn't happen.  Say, ""I'm hearing you, I know it's happening."" Start sort of a bipartisan moderation to the extent that you can.  I think he can move forward with the Republicans on taxes in a way that makes the public say, ""Wow, that's pretty good."" Extend it. He could do the same thing, it seems to me, on START, if he brings in the past Republican leaders who have supported START in the past--George H.W.  Bush, George W.  Bush.  Be bipartisan. Be big. Receive the message of 2010 and transcend it as a bipartisan figure."
97,"MR. GREGORY:  But, E.J., it's not just a question of his left being disappointed, but that is a big piece.  Because whether you're a supporter on the left or maybe you're an independent who voted for President Obama, you may feel betrayed in some areas, whether it's ""don't ask, don't tell."" The president said, ""I'm going to end that.  I'm going to close down Guantanamo Bay.  I'm going to do all of these things."" And there's a feeling like he hasn't exercised some of that leadership to get some of these things done. Does he still face that test?"
98,"MR. DIONNE:  Well, you know, some of the criticism, I think, is unfair, which is to say, a guy who got all of these things done--health care was a hugely difficult thing to get passed, and the financial reform, and the stimulus.  A lot of us thought it should have been bigger, but it kept us from falling into a, a catastrophe.  I think where he's got problems with the left and parts of the center is a sense of what are you going to fight for?  When are you going to stand up to these guys?  I mean, if the Republican bargaining position is what's yours is mine and what's mine is mine, if they're not going to give an inch, then I think his core supporters, but also the American people, who want somebody strong in the White House, want him to call them on it.  I thought that Senator Kyl on the new START treaty, I think this is an amazing position he's taking. This is something supported by the entire range of conservative opinion,
from Bob Kagan, a neocon, to Pat Buchanan, a paleocon, Henry Kissinger, James A.  Baker III.  I don't know why he's opposing this.  I don't think it was clear from his answer, except he wanted to block a lot of other stuff in the last Congress."
99,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let me pick up on START with Ed Gillespie.  There's a cartoon that caught our eye we'll put up on the screen, Matt Davies in the Journal News.  And, and the slug on it is ""The Cold War, 2010,"" and what you've got there at the table are Russia and the United States on one side, and Republicans on the other.  Ed, is this, is this a test of whether bipartisanship is real, whether the president has the ability to make the politics tough enough for Republicans that they have to start saying yes to him?"
100,"MR. GILLESPIE:  Yeah.  The, the problem here is that they're a day late and a dollar short in terms of coming to terms with the START treaty and working with Congress on it.  And what's so extraordinary to me about this meeting with the congressional leaders coming up, is that it's so extraordinary.  The fact is, is that President Obama does not have a working relationship with Republicans in Congress, and not many Democrats in Congress either.  And so they--you know, Senator Kyl has been asking legitimate questions for a long time about the START treaty.  He's the number two Republican in the Senate, he is the leader in our party on these nuclear weapons issues, and the White House is essentially acted as if they're getting, you know, mail from a college intern working for a freshman House member."
101,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, that's..."
102,"MR. DIONNE:  No, that's not true.  I mean, the White House has made concession..."
103,"MR. GILLESPIE:  No, it is true.  No, it is."
104,"MR. DIONNE:  ...after concession to Jon Kyl.  He wanted to modernize the nuclear force, they said, ""Great."" I mean, this is..."
105,MR. GILLESPIE:  Yeah.  Late.
106,MR. DIONNE:  There have been 12 hearings or something like that.
107,"MR. GILLESPIE:  Well, yeah.  But look, they are not--they're trying to..."
108,"MS. NOONAN:  Yeah, the White House didn't focus."
109,"MR. GILLESPIE:  It was even clear in the paper today, they're trying to work around him, and that's a mistake."
110,"MR. DIONNE:  Well, now they are, because they're astonished by his position."
111,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Mayor, Mayor Nutter, go ahead."
112,"MAYOR NUTTER:  I mean, I, I have to--Peggy made a comment to start, who I greatly respect and admire.  President Obama almost reinvented bipartisanship. Do we forget what happened in the Economic Recovery Act? No House Republican voted for it, only three Republican senators voted for it; $787 billion package to move this country out of near financial collapse, and the one--one of the senators from Pennsylvania was almost run out of his party.  What are we talking about?  Senator McConnell has said that his number one goal, his main, apparently, mission in life now is to take senator--President Obama out of office.  That's bipartisanship?  I don't think so."
113,"MR. GILLESPIE:  Well, it's not bipartisanship either..."
114,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but the--right."
115,"MR. GILLESPIE:  ...when, when, at the meeting with the, with the House Republicans, when you're talking about the stimulus package, and they offer their suggestions, and President Obama's response at that time was, ""I won.  I don't have to take your ideas."""
116,MS. NOONAN:  Yeah.
117,MR. GILLESPIE:  And so they...
118,"MAYOR NUTTER:  Well, it's very interesting..."
119,"MR. GILLESPIE:  He, he chose a course of, of pursuing a straight Democratic Party vote on the stimulus package.  "
120,"MAYOR NUTTER:  Well, now they have a, now they have a seat at the table."
121,MR. GREGORY:  A vote...
122,MS. NOONAN:  He really did.
123,MR. GILLESPIE:  Now they have a seat at the table.
124,MAYOR NUTTER:  Now they have to govern.
125,MR. GILLESPIE:  I agree with that.  Right.
126,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, but here's the question."
127,MAYOR NUTTER:  They have to stop campaigning and govern.  We'll see what they do.
128,"MR. GREGORY:  Peggy Noonan, what does the president do to confound his critics?  That was an observation you made in the past, that he has not done very well at that.  Here are his opportunities, whether it's tax cuts, whether it's the START treaty, whether it's going to be the debt commission.  Where is he going to make the politics difficult for Republicans?  Because I've talked to Republicans who say, ""He's making it very easy for us to say no, and that's been the case for 22 months."""
129,"MS. NOONAN:  Yeah.  Well, I'm afraid I'll be repeating my point, but I see no sign, really, that the Obama White House has decided, ""We have to really change the way we're going forward here."" They don't seem--it, it seems--it--when I look at them, I see people who think it is a concession to some sort of new reality that they don't want--if they admit, ""OK, 2010 actually changed things, changed our numbers on the Hill, etc."" If the president sort of shakes himself, dusts himself off and comes forward and says, ""Guys, I'm going to work with you on this tax stuff,"" everybody in America has to know what their tax rates are going to be for the next
year, two years, three years.  It is irresponsible not to do it.  ""I'm working with you.  I'm going to concede a lot.  I'm going to let this thing go forward."""
130,"MR. GREGORY:  But, E.J., you made a point about, you made a point about the tax cuts.  That could be a huge mistake for the president to--you know, if Democrats are to stand by working people to, to not extend jobless benefits at the time when you're extending tax cuts for upper
earners. "
131,"MR. DIONNE:  It, it would be astonishing.  I mean, the--there are five unemployed people for every job in America.  The average payment out for--on unemployment compensation is $290 bucks a week.  This tax cut for the rich people is 100,000 bucks or more for every millionaire.  It would be absurd not to help the unemployed at a moment when we got almost 10 percent unemployment and unemployment compensation has a bigger bang for the buck.  I think the president, on the tax cut, has gone more than out of his way.  In fact, I think he's made too many premature concessions to the Republicans.  Yes, I think he should say, ""Let's talk about this."" I think you laid out a good solution in the question, which is pass a tax cut for the middle class that everybody agrees on.  If this is such a high priority for Republicans to pass a tax cut for the rich, let them do it in the next Congress."
132,"MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.  Let me get, quickly, before I take a break, Mayor Nutter, this issue that we've been dealing with over this holiday season here of the TSA pat-downs.  Is there a better way?  Is the administration going to have to revisit this issue?"
133,"MAYOR NUTTER:  Well, security measures are always subject to review.  I mean, I go through the airport, and everyone wants everyone to be safe, so--and not particular intrusive.  Now, at times you're going to run into some conflicts there.  Can it be done differently?  Can it be done better?  I'm sure they could figure out a way to do it to get people through.  But apparently everyone got to see grandma over the course of the Thanksgiving holiday with no long lines, not a whole lot of nonsense. Everyone wants to be safe and secure on an airplane, that is the bottom line.  We seem to forget how we arrived at this point.  So, you know, full-body scan or off into a separate room, you know, every security measure is always subject to review, you always want to do things better. The bottom line is safety on an airplane."
134,MS. NOONAN:  After eight years you might want to rethink it.
135,"MR. GREGORY:  Ed Gillespie, you were in the Bush White House--what's that?"
136,"MS. NOONAN:  After eight years, you might want to rethink it.  We started out here, we added this, we added this."
137,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
138,"MS. NOONAN:  Now we're doing this.  Stop, look back, rethink the whole thing with an eye to what will work in terms of real safety and what is unacceptable treatment of humans."
139,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Ed Gillespie, here's what the Bush administration understood, which is the American people are here after 9/11, maybe they're here now."
140,MR. GILLESPIE:  Yeah.
141,"MR. GREGORY:  They can get back to here in a moment.  And as the president said over the weekend, if somebody gets through and blows up an airplane, people are not going to say, ""Oh, well, they still shouldn't have had those, you know, extensive pat-downs."""
142,"MR. GILLESPIE:  The challenge for, the challenge for government is always, and having worked in the White House, there is a trade-off between security and individual liberty that you constantly are trying to get right.  And the line moves, you know, depending..."
143,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
144,"MR. GILLESPIE:  ...on where public sentiment is.  And it's moved.  And I think that, that, you know, this is probably going to have to be adapted to, most likely by technology, as was talked about here, as I suspect, at the end of the day."
145,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
146,"MAYOR NUTTER:  Three weeks ago, we had airplanes grounded in the United States, freight airplanes, with a concern about bombs in cartridges. "
147,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
148,MAYOR NUTTER:  This threat is not over.
149,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
150,MAYOR NUTTER:  We need to pay attention to it.
151,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We're going to take a break here.  We're going to come back and talk about battleground 2012.  Yes, it's already upon us.  How does it look, from Sarah Palin to other Republicans challenging the president potentially?  More from our roundtable right after this brief station break."
152,(Announcements)
153,"MR. GREGORY:  We're back with more of our roundtable.  If you, you know, if you don't believe that things are rough in Washington, all you got to do is look at the cover of the New York Post.  From even a holiday weekend, President Obama, no Republicans involved, and he's still got a fat lip from playing basketball.  He took an elbow to the lip, and there he is.  He was at a ball game yesterday, and they've done a good job, actually.  It doesn't look like he's got too much of an injury there. But it's not easy, Mayor Nutter. You know, you got--you mix it up.  Who's got sharp elbows?  Even the guys you're playing ball with."
154,"MAYOR NUTTER:  Politics is a rough and tumble business, much, much like basketball."
155,"MR. GREGORY:  Exactly, exactly.  Well, Ed remembers, you know, when President Bush would go mountain biking, too, and come back..."
156,MR. GILLESPIE:  Yeah.
157,MR. GREGORY:  ...with his face scratched up.  So these are active presidents.
158,"Let's take a look at the 2012 landscape.  It's interesting to think about. What are the issues that are really going to be the ramp up to the 2012 race? Here's a Marist poll, indication of where things stand. Forty-eight percent saying that they would vote against Obama if the election were held today. It's not held today.  Here's some of the Republicans who are polling in double digits at the moment.  You see Romney, Huckabee, Palin, Gingrich.  They're the ones in double digits. Romney top of the pack.  Ed Gillespie, I've spoken to Republicans who say
the only order right now, in the Republican side, is disorder in terms of that big question:  Who are you going to nominate? "
159,"MR. GILLESPIE:  Well, it's an exciting time.  We have a big field.  I mean, just saw a pretty extensive list..."
160,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
161,"MR. GILLESPIE:  ...all of whom, you know, have a shot.  And I think that's good for the party.  I think new faces are helpful.  I think the more that people bring to the caucuses in Iowa and the primaries in New Hampshire, the better off we are as a party.  I was one who watched, you know, a pretty competitive Democratic primary between Senator Clinton and Senator Obama and thought it was actually good for the Democrats."
162,MS. NOONAN:  Yes.
163,"MR. GILLESPIE:  A competitive primary will be good for us, and we're going to have one, a very wide open field.  It's exciting."
164,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let's come back to the, to the Republicans in just a minute."
165,"But E.J., how much vulnerability does President Obama have as you extend out a little bit?  You can look by six month chunks and see how vulnerable he, he might be as he goes into 2012."
166,"MR. DIONNE:  Well, if the economy doesn't move between now and 2012 very much, he's very vulnerable.  I think he knows that, everybody knows that. I think one of the keys is, do we begin to have some real growth?  And we're still going to have pretty high unemployment.  Does the president sort of prepare people for the fact that we're going to come back, but we're not going to be where we want to be, but people sense that things are getting better?  I think that's a critical thing.  I think on the--it will also depend who the Republican nominee is.  And Ed's right, a vigorous fight can be very good for a party.  A divisive fight can be
very bad for the party.  Will there be--does Sarah Palin run? "
167,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
168,"MR. DIONNE:  If she runs, is there a stop Palin movement of some kind? If that happens, what does that do to the enthusiasm on the right of the Republican Party?  We don't know any of that yet."
169,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we'll get to some of that.  Let's talk about the map, though, because we were just having this debate about the role of government.  This is from Politico on Friday.  ""Rob Collins, president of the American Action Network, a GOP-friendly group set up to support
conservatives, said ... independents willing to give Obama a chance in 2008 have left him for good over the stimulus, healthcare reform, and jobs."
170,"""`Barack Obama's map is starting to look a lot like John Kerry's,'"" said Collins, former chief of staff to House Minority Whip Eric Cantor (R-Va.). `Part of this winning coalition was made up of new voters, higher turnout among African-Americans and independents.  Looking at where these groups poll now, I don't see that coalition performing at the level it did in 2008.  Iowa is a bright spot.  But Florida, Wisconsin, Indiana, Virginia, New Mexico--these are scary places for him now.'"""
171,"Mayor Nutter, the middle of the electorate was with the president.  They have moved away from the president.  How do you get him back?  Is it a fight with Republicans over slashing spending, dealing with the debt? What is that road to political recovery?"
172,"MAYOR NUTTER:  Well, first, David, at this moment in time, President Obama's numbers are better than Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and Bill Clinton at this point in their presidencies, and many of them had much better economies while they were functioning as president.  So everyone has taken into account bad times, tough times.  And here's a president who walked into this.  Things were bad when he showed up.  The day he was sworn in, it was already tough.  He has two years, and a lot can happen in politics in two years.  First of all, we're already starting to see signs of things moving in the right direction in Philadelphia.  And if some of these commentators would actually get out every now and then, they'd see the same thing going on in cities all across America. Companies moving into Philadelphia, expanding.  We're using our economic recovery dollars in ways that are putting people to work but also inspiring businesses to invest more, which is really what that program is all about.  So the president being on the ground in those cities, in those areas where people are starting to see it, feel it, and experience it, a lot is going to happen; '10 into '11, '11 is going to start the surge back into '12.  It'd be a very different landscape."
173,"MR. GREGORY:  But that's not what happened in your Senate race in this midterm election in terms of people in the city.  Just in, in the collar counties, you know, surging out in terms of a vote, I mean, people are, are dispirited."
174,"MAYOR NUTTER:  Well, David, I would suggest to you that we actually astounded some of the political pundits and prognosticators in Philadelphia.  Forty-two percent turnout, 84 percent of the vote to the top two candidates for governor and senator in Philadelphia.  So folks
understand what the president is going through, what he's all about. That's going to--that will--experience will go out into the counties as well."
175,MS. NOONAN:  I'll say...
176,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let me, let me, let me come back to, to, Peggy on this. The Palin factor is big in a lot of ways, like E.J. suggested. Does she run and what impact does she have, even by threatening to run, on the rest of that field as you look at those Republican numbers?"
177,"MS. NOONAN:  Let me just say before that, I think Obama lost the center during health care because he seemed not to be moderate.  His great hope now is that the Republicans in power will, in comparison, make him look moderate. If they overstep, that could happen and that could save him."
178,"As for Palin, everybody's waiting to see what her plans are.  She's in Iowa now on her book tour."
179,"MR. GREGORY:  On her book tour, yeah."
180,"MS. NOONAN:  I thought your question to me was going to be, ""Why is she in Iowa?"" And I was going to answer, ""So that we would all talk about why she is in Iowa."" You know?"
181,MR. GREGORY:  In Iowa.
182,"MS. NOONAN:  Nobody knows what she's going to do.  My own personal opinion, my guess actually, is that she will not run.  But until she decides she is or she isn't, she freezes things up.  She takes the oxygen out of the room, and a lot of guys who are thinking of running are going to hold back and watch, see what she does."
183,"MR. GREGORY:  It's--Ed Gillespie, it, it's not just Palin, it's also the tea party influence and, and how Republicans perform over the next six months to a year, right, that might determine who they want their standard-bearer to be and where the real center of power is. Because even if she doesn't run, she will still command a lot of attention."
184,"MR. GILLESPIE:  Absolutely.  And she, she drives coverage and drives agenda and--but, look, the fact is, from a Republican perspective, for Republicans in Congress and those seeking the nomination, the good news is that right now we are not whipsawed between our base and the middle of the electorate.  Most independents are with Republicans on the core issues of taxes, jobs, economy. And the Democrats are whipsawed between their base and, and the vast majority of voters in the middle.  And that's what you're seeing right now, David.  In fact, it's not so much how we talk about things, it's what we're talking about.  We just talked about this lame-duck session of Congress.  Their agenda is gays in the military, getting subsidies for illegal immigrants for college, the START treaty with Russia, new environmental regulations, and FDA reform."
185,"MR. DIONNE:  And the Disclose Act, so groups..."
186,MR. GILLESPIE:  And most Americans and most...
187,MR. DIONNE:  ...like yours that spent a lot of money...
188,MR. GILLESPIE:  And--fine!
189,MR. DIONNE:  ...in the last election have to say where the money came from.
190,"MR. GILLESPIE:  And that's what--and E.J. that's what you care a lot about. Do you think most Americans are at the water cooler right now saying, ""Boy, please pass the Disclose Act."""
191,MR. DIONNE:  They are overwhelmingly for the Disclose Act.
192,"MR. GILLESPIE:  In the lame duck session of Congress, they're not talking about jobs and they're not talking about the economy."
193,"MS. NOONAN:  Guys, you have a few weeks here."
194,"MR. GILLESPIE:  The fact is, Obama, Reid, and Pelosi, they have their fingers on the pulse of the country.  I'm just not sure which country. You know, they're not talking about the things that most Americans are talking about, which is jobs, taxes, the economy, and the largest tax
increase in American history..."
195,MR. DIONNE:  The Republicans--jobs is absolutely right.  And...
196,"MR. GILLESPIE:  ...in a little more than a month, E.J., and they have done nothing about it."
197,"MR. DIONNE:  And you know what the problem for the Republicans is, that they are whipsawed between a right wing that managed to nominate candidates in Nevada, in Delaware.  They needed a write-in candidate to save them in Alaska. And I think the interesting dynamic in the
Republican Party is a lot of establishment Republicans feel under enormous pressure from this right wing not to cave at all, not to moderate at all.  And it's going to be very interesting to watch how the leadership deals with this right wing that's standing behind them with bayonets."
198,MS. NOONAN:  Oh.
199,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, let me take another break here.  We'll come back with some final thoughts on this in just a moment.  Don't go away."
200,(Announcements)
201,"MR. GREGORY:  A couple of quick pieces of business.  Ed Gillespie, just to button up the 2012 discussion, you've been around in the White House when a sitting president thinks about re-election.  How does the president go about this, you know, play against type here, where he looks at that landscape and, and tries to be successful?"
202,"MR. GILLESPIE:  Well, he's got to be concerned about the Great Lakes.  He has got to be looking at the results from this election in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, and, and he has got to be thinking, ""What am I going to do?"" And I think that comes back to the question of jobs, David, and especially in the, in the industrial Midwest.  And if I were the president in this White House, I would be thinking, ""How do we reconnect with those voters in the Great Lakes, because it's hard to see a path to re-election without picking up a lot of those states."
203,"MR. GREGORY:  The nap--the map really does narrow when you think about
it."
204,MR. GILLESPIE:  Yeah.
205,MR. GREGORY:  It's not about the whole country.
206,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  OK, last but not least, Mayor Nutter, I have been saving a very special--the sports news that is rocking the city of Philadelphia.  And I know what you're thinking, and it's not that.  The Philadelphia Phillies could not hold on to their first base coach, the
great Davy Lopes, number 15 there, with the Phillies skipper.  He is now returning to Los Angeles, where he belongs, to be the first base coach for my Los Angeles Dodgers.  He is finally back.  It's a stunning blow to the city of Philadelphia.  How did this happen?  And I'm just happy that it did."
207,"MAYOR NUTTER:  Well, I'm happy that you're happy.  And I--Charlie Manuel and I have an agreement.  I don't tell him how to run the team, and he doesn't tell me how to run the city.  Everything's great.  Two--three World Series appearances."
208,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah, they're still pretty good.  But we're very happy..."
209,"MAYOR NUTTER:  Two in the last three years, we're very excited."
210,"MR. GREGORY:  ...to have Davy Lopes back.  Has the city, has the city embraced Michael Vick?"
211,"MAYOR NUTTER:  They have.  Michael Vick is a great player, but he's also doing some off-field things..."
212,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
213,"MAYOR NUTTER:  ...demonstrating that he's also a great person, learned from his mistakes.  Philadelphia is a city of redemption and a city of second chances."
214,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Well, that's your sports roundup for this morning. That's it for today.  We'll be back next week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, the countdown to November 2nd, Election Day. The president is on the trail trying to protect home turf, stumping for the Democrat vying for his old Senate seat.
    "
2,(Videotape)
3,PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  You can trust him.  You can count on him.
4,(End videotape)
5,"MR. GREGORY:  As the GOP threatens to change the balance of power in Washington, the fight for the Illinois Senate seat is still too close to call. This morning we kick off our election year Senate debate series with a showdown between the Democrat, Illinois State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, and the Republican, Congressman Mark Kirk.  The big issues:  jobs, spending and taxes, and the credibility questions dogging both candidates, making this an intensely negative campaign."
6,"Then, our political roundtable on the bigger picture.  How new jobless numbers affect the campaign, whether Democrats can make the election a closer contest than most expect, and another high-level departure from the White House.  With us, Time magazine columnist Joe Klein and The Wall Street Journals Peggy Noonan."
7,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
8,"MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.  With only 23 days to go, the campaign team of President Obama and Vice President Biden heads to Philadelphia today to try to rally Democrats to turn out for Pennsylvania Senate candidate Joe Sestak.  But here in Washington this morning its all eyes on the tight battle in Illinois."
9,"(Videotape, October 7, 2010)"
10,"PRES. OBAMA:  Hello, Chicago.  Oh, its good to be home."
11,(End videotape)
12,MR. GREGORY:  The fight is personal for the president.
13,"(Videotape, October 7, 2010)"
14,"PRES. OBAMA:  In some very tough circumstances, in a tough political season, you know, he has not wavered.  And thats the kind of person that you want. Thats the kind of person that you know when the going gets tough in Washington will be fighting for you."
15,(End videotape)
16,"MR. GREGORY:  Democratic State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, neck and neck with five-term Republican Congressman Mark Kirk, battling for perhaps the most famous Senate seat up for grabs in this midterm race:  President Obamas former seat.  For the GOP, its the ultimate prize."
17,"MR. CHUCK TODD:  The fact of the matter is if Democrats hold the majority, itll be because they held the presidents Senate seat.  If they lose the majority, it means that one of the seats they lost is the presidents Senate seat.  Thats the ultimate repudiation if youre a former Illinois senator now sitting in the Oval Office."
18,"MR. GREGORY:  It is also a race that was marred by scandal from the start. When President Obama left one end of Pennsylvania Avenue for the other, then-Governor Rod Blagojevich ignored objections from Democratic leaders and appointed a former state attorney general, Roland Burris, to the seat. Blagojevich was later arrested, charged with attempting to sell the presidents old Senate seat.  Then the campaigning began and the scandals continued."
19,(Clip from campaign ad)
20,"MR. GREGORY:  Kirk, a Navy reservist, has a list of erroneous or exaggerated claims about his military record, including his service in the Gulf War and during the invasion of Iraq.  And Giannoulias, a 34-year-old former college basketball star who played professionally in Greece, has been plagued with questions surrounding his familys troubled bank and whether Giannoulias, at the time a senior loan officer at the bank, was aware of $20 million in loans to a pair of Chicago criminals."
21,"MS. LYNN SWEET:  If all youre looking at is the negative side, you have a choice between a serial embellisher and a mob banker."
22,"MR. GREGORY:  So how will Illinois voters decide, and what will the outcome say about this midterm campaign?"
23,"And joining me now, Republican Congressman Mark Kirk and Illinois State Treasurer Democrat Alexi Giannoulias."
24,"Welcome to both of you to our studio and to this debate, MEET THE PRESS style. So there are no set rules.  Were sitting around this table, were going to have a conversation, and were going to go through the issues.  And theres a lot to get to, so lets get to it."
25,"I dont have to tell you both, the specter of President Obama hangs over this race because indeed it was his Senate seat that you are now vying for.  And it was on Election Day, November 4th, 2008, in Chicago, when the president and his family appeared after he was then the president-elect, and this is what he said."
26,"(Videotape, November 4, 2008)"
27,"PRES. OBAMA:  Its been a long time coming.  But tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America."
28,(End videotape)
29,"MR. GREGORY:  Mr.  Giannoulias, let me start with you.  How would you define the change that has come to America under President Barack Obama?"
30,"MR. ALEXI GIANNOULIAS:  Well, I think its important to put things in context.  And if you look at the mess that he inherited and the enormous challenges that he inheriteda trillion-dollar deficit, increasing job lossesI think hes done everything he can to help turn this economy around. The question is, going forward, what more can we do?  We focused our campaign on creating private sector jobs, weve talked about infrastructure, weve talked about moving forward with the next generation of clean energy, clean energy jobs, tax breaks to small businesses, a job creation tax credit for small business, a payroll tax holiday for low to moderate income workers, doing everything we can to get that $1.5 trillion thats, quite frankly, sitting on the sidelines in the private sector, encouraging and promoting economic growth."
31,MR. GREGORY:  But the countrys better off in this economic recession because of the change that President Obama brought?
32,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  I think if you look at what wouldve happened if some of the measures werent takenand again, they werent, werent perfect.  For example, I think when you look at TARP, the bailouts for the biggest banks, something that Congressman Kirk voted for, I think I wouldve liked to have seen, as a, as a former community banker, some more oversight, some more accountability, requirement that these banks lend money to help increase access to capital, something weve done in the State Treasurers Office.  I think that was a, a missed opportunity."
33,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman, you had said at a rally back in March, a GOP rally, that Obama, that weabout the president, We are on the way to making this guy a one-termer. How do you answer that question?  How do you define the change hes brought to America?"
34,Transcript & resource archive
35,"REP. MARK KIRK (R-IL):  A tremendous amount of debt.  Ive got a chart here that shows our debt-to-GDP ratio.  And while we did run deficits in the past, we now number our debt in trillions rather than in billions.  And I think that represents a long-term danger, especially to the, the American dream.  Every American born today owes $43,000 to the federal government the day she or he is born.  And we are transferring a tremendous amount of debt to the new generation, much of it owed to overseas creditors who expect to be repaid by our children with interest."
36,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Congressman, as a Republican member of Congress, do you really want to stand by your partys record on the debt going back since you came to Congress?"
37,"REP. KIRK:  No.  Ive become very much of a fiscal hawk here.  I foreswore earmarks for my own congressional district, we could save $66 billion right there.  The Kirk Amendment passed in the House that attacked the bridge to nowhere, even though it was in a Republican district, the chairman of the House Transportation Committee, and now its actually the bridges to nowhere will not be built."
38,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, I want to come back to the debt in just a minute, but I want to talk about the number one issue, I think, which is jobs, on the minds of everyunemployment is 9.9 percent in Illinois.  And look at this chart, which is really a tale of woe in this country.  You go back to 2009 in August; since that point, unemployment has been at 9.5 percent or higher. Thats 14 straight months.  Congressman Kirk, Ill start with you.  What do you do at this point as the federal government to spur private sector job creation?"
39,"REP. KIRK:  First of all, we recognize that the stimulus has largely failed. A very small part of it even went to infrastructure development projects.  It didnt answer the question, what happens when all the borrowed money runs out? Secondly, this Congress has been very, very viciously anti-businessnew taxes, new regulation.  We need senators and congressmen that will back a pro-growth agenda.  For example, my Small Business Bill of Rights, 10 new policies to help out the number one employers in Illinois and the United States, small business.  Half of all the jobs, 80 percent of the job losses in the great recession.  They cant afford a Washington lobbyist to go find stimulus money or a Washington lawyer to wade through the latest 1,000-page bill that congressional leaders havent even read."
40,"MR. GREGORY:  So tax, tax relief, tax cuts, in your mind, is really the job creation answer."
41,"REP. KIRK:  Well, a pro-growth agenda."
42,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
43,"REP. KIRK:  Like making sure we dont pass legislation to take away your right to a secret ballot in a union election.  My opponent wants to take that right away, called the Card Check bill.  I think thats a terrible idea."
44,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, Mr.  Giannoulias, how do you answer the question, job creation?"
45,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  I think one of the problem, I think one of the problems, quite frankly, is we have typical Washington, D.C., politicians who have forgotten what its like on Main Street.  Im the only candidate in this race whos worked in the private sector.  Congressman Kirk has been in Washington, D.C., for 20 years.  If youre thrilled with out-of-control spending, the out-of-control borrowing that has become the Washington, D.C., ethos, then Congressman Kirk is your man.  I think what we have to do..."
46,"MR. GREGORY:  My question is, what do you do to create private sector jobs, to put people back to work?  What you just said doesnt put anybody back to work, and thats what people are wondering."
47,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  So what weve done in, in the State Treasurers Office, for example, low interest loan programs, increasing access to capital.  One of the biggest problems out there that I hear from my friends in the business community is that theres no lending, that its tough to get a loan today. Even if you have a line of credit, its being tapped.  So one of the first things that we need to do is find ways to increase liquidity, to increase access to capital, to make sure that $1.8 trillion that is sitting on the sidelines in the banking system, which can be leveraged to at least $18 trillion, we need to do everything we can to focus on that.  We need to focus on green jobs:  solar, wind, geothermal, biomass.  Theres so many opportunities.  But other countries like China are getting ahead of the curve."
48,"MR. GREGORY:  The government did do a lot with the stimulus, right?  You had actually said the stimulus was not big enough.  Youve also said youre going to lead a progressive caucus if youre the senator from Illinois.  Will you push the administration, if elected, to enact more stimulus, to spend more money to try to get more people back to work?"
49,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  If, if more stimulus means more tax cuts to small businesses, if, if more stimulus means middle class tax cuts, then Im for it. I will tell you that we also have to keep in mind what the Recovery Act really did.  A third of it was tax cuts to middle class families, a third of it was emergency measure toemergency funding to state and municipalities, something that Ive seen as state treasurer is important."
50,"MR. GREGORY:  But do you acknowledge it hasnt done the trick?  I mean, 14 months of unemployment.  They said that it wouldif you passed stimulus, it wouldthe unemployment would get to 8 point--8 percent; 9.5 percent for 14 straight months."
51,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  I think, David, the bigger question is what would have happenedand it wasnt flawlessly done.  But if, if you take a look at what would have happened, I mean, do we need to see soup lines down the street to figure out what would have happened?  We avoidedand all economists will tell you that millions of jobs were saved because of the Recovery Act, and we avoided a second Great Depression.  That, that is a reality."
52,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, let me have you two engage on the big tax debate here.  Congressman, do you think that the Bush-era tax cuts should be extended for all Americans?"
53,REP. KIRK:  Right.  Like CNN just did a survey of economists...
54,MR. GREGORY:  You believe that.
55,"REP. KIRK:  ...saying that they should not have a new big tax increase on December 31st.  If you look what congressional leaders want to do, they want to hit the U.S. economy with a $900 billion tax increase on December 31st on top of the 10 new taxes that were in the healthcare bill, on top of the taxes that were in financial regulation bill, on top of the taxes that were in the August congressional legislation.  I dont thinkthe, the key danger here is will our policies increase the chance of a double-dip recession?  If you look at the job numbers just last week, we have a significant danger of that.  And taking more money out of the private economy and having the government perform as it has poorly done with the stimulus I dont think is the right way to go."
56,"MR. GREGORY:  But its interesting youd say that.  And you said just a moment ago, if I heard you right, that youre a deficit hawk, a fiscal hawk."
57,REP. KIRK:  Thats right.
58,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, back in 2004 you were part of this Republican Main Street Partnership.  And as part of that group, you had a press release on 2004.  Im going to put some of it up on the screen.  Today the Republican Main Street Partnership, the largest organization of elected moderate Republicans in the nation, offered six principles for the fiscal year 05 budget resolution that were designed to put Congress on a path toward a balanced budget.  These principles, you said then, stand for a key value that once we adopt the budget, we must have the tools to stick to it, said Congressman Mark Kirk. Now, here was a key part of that:  Tax cuts should only be extended temporarily and limited to those that are due to expire in 2004. Key point: We simply cant afford permanent and across-the-board extensions at this time. Thats what you said then, when the..."
59,REP. KIRK:  Right.
60,"MR. GREGORY:  ...when the debt was about one-third of what it was today. Congressman, how can we afford to make permanent tax extensions now with the Bush tax cuts in this climate?"
61,"REP. KIRK:  Because especially in this climate we have congressional leaders that are not interested in spending restraint at all.  For example, I back spending restraint across the board; at the DOD, like no second engine for the F-35 fighter, closing down Joint Forces Command, across-the-board reductions. When you look at the state of the economy right now, you have to set a priority.  And my top priority is the deficit of jobs and economic growth, and especially this perception that the United States could be falling behind especially Asian economies.  If we go through all the tax increases that congressional leaders proposeand by the way, Congress is going to come back right after the election in this lame duck session of Congress with a new round of spending in a omnibus appropriation bill, and new tax increases."
62,"MR. GREGORY:  But the question, but the question, Mr.  Giannoulias, should tax cuts be paid for?"
63,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  And this, this is why this race is so important.  This is a fundamental public policy difference between myself and Congressman Kirk.  He says hes a, a fiscal hawk.  Look, the congressman has told some real whoppers during this campaign, but that may be the biggest one of all.  He voted for every single one of the Bush budgets, which doubled our national debt.  He voted to increase his own pay six times.  He voted for the bridge to nowhere twice.  He voted to raise the debt ceiling four times.  The list goes on and on.  So, Congressman, saying youre a fiscal hawk doesnt necessarily make it true, and your voting record proves that its not true.  The question is, for the Congressman, the $700 billion in tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, we dont have $700 billion.  So my question to the congressman is, which country do you plan on borrowing $700 billion from?  The Saudis, China?  We, we cant afford it.  And thats one of the problems, quite frankly, with Washington, D.C., this overborrowing, overspending."
64,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, Congressman, respond to that.  Republican leaders, as you know, have said that tax cuts dont have to be paid for.  And the presidents said, look, theres $700 billion they want to extend.  Where are they going to get the money?"
65,"REP. KIRK:  Were going to get the money by spending reductions across the board, by cutting out whole programs and making sure that we have a, a new set of mechanisms.  For example, the president has been rumored to be bringing forward a line item veto proposal.  Republicans should support that.  We should have a new Grace Commission put forward with base closing powers to put a joint bill to House and Senate with just one up or down vote."
66,"But its ironic for my opponent to criticize my record of fiscal conservatism. In front of the Chicago Tribune, they asked him, name one spending bill that you would actually vote to cut.  He couldnt name one.  And as the Chicago Tribune said, when they endorsed me, it was painful to watch."
67,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, speaking of painful, lets pick up on that because I was going to ask each of you, in this circumstance, what is a painful choice you would make to bring the, the, the budget into balance, a spending cut that you would make?"
68,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  Look, the, thethis country has not lived within its means for a very long time, and, and the truth is were going to have to take our medicine."
69,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
70,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  And what the Deficit Commission says in Decembers going to be important.  To answer your question, and this is an area where I think the congressman and I would agree, I would have voted against the omnibus spending bill which included thousands of earmarks, a lot of pork.  And, and quite frankly, this is where the president made a mistake.  He should have, he should have vetoed it."
71,"MR. GREGORY:  But, you know, every, everybody comes into Congress, says were going to cut out wasteful spending.  I mean, lets be honest.  Most of the spending is an explosion of entitlement spendingSocial Security, Medicare and, and the like.  What would you do on some of these big runaway programs? Social Security, would you look at upping the retirement age in order to basically cut benefits and save some of that money?"
72,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  Again, were going to have to take a look at what the Deficit Commission says and look at their ideas.  I am personally not in favor of, of increasing the age limit.  I do think we do need to look at, on the revenue side, different options, maybe increasing the taxable wage base, finding ways to get more revenue.  But Im all for strengthening Social Security, not diminishing it."
73,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman Kirk, if you were serious about cutting the deficit and cutting spending, why dont you stand up beside Paul Ryan, the congressman from Wisconsin, whos put forward some pretty draconian cuts in entitlement spending, like Social Security and Medicare?  Do you stand with him in those cuts?"
74,"REP. KIRK:  Ifirst of all, we have a wholewe need a whole range of cuts. For example..."
75,"MR. GREGORY:  But no, my question is do you stand with him in some of his suggested cuts to Medicare?"
76,"REP. KIRK:  I, I, I have my own cuts which I want to put forward.  We should, for example, sell off big parts of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Southeastern Power Administration.  We should consolidate depot maintenance at the Department of Defense.  We should have lawsuit reform, which CBO says would save at least the federal government $54 billion.  I could go on an on beyond the F-35 engine and the earmark spending, which would save $60..."
77,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you go beyond the Republican pledge, which is to go back to 2008 discretionary spending levels?"
78,REP. KIRK:  I think we need a radical reduction in spending because we have...
79,MR. GREGORY:  Beyond 2008 levels?
80,REP. KIRK:  2008 is a great start.
81,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
82,"REP. KIRK:  You know, this Congress hasnt..."
83,"MR. GREGORY:  But you recognize 2008 thats in the pledge isnt nearly enough to deal with the size of the deficit, right?"
84,"REP. KIRK:  But I will tell you, one this thats missing from this whole debate is no effort to put forward pro-growth policies.  If the United States launches on a plan, as my opponents policies would do, to be a very high tax, high spending, high regulation economy like many European economies, then we inevitably have the slow growth and high unemployment of those economies. Thats not the American way.  The American way is a limited government and lower taxes, and a very robust small business sector, which is especially employing low-income and minority kids coming into the American dream.  I very much worry right now that if were embracing a European-style very high debt, very high tax environment, we will suffer all of the slow growth problems that theyve had."
85,"MR. GREGORY:  One more policy issue, quickly, between you:  health care. Congressman, you have said that you would lead the charge to repeal healthcare reform as passed by this Congress.  Is that still your position?"
86,"REP. KIRK:  Thats right.  When I came back to the United States, I met with the Republican leader and said we have to be the party of better, we just cant be the party of no.  So weve put together the Republican alternative, which I introduced in the Congress, 400 pages.  It was not allowed for a debate or even discussion or a vote.  But it did three big things.  First, the Medical Rights Act that says Congress should make no law interfering with decisions youve made with your doctor.  Second, lawsuit reform, which was completely skipped and needs to be in there.  And third, Congress should defend your right to buy health insurance from any state in the union if you find a plan less expensive to cover your family."
87,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Well, well, but you, you will try to repeal it, the way the bills existing?"
88,"REP. KIRK:  Andyeah.  But then lets look at the healthcare bill we passed: $500 billion dollars in cuts for seniorfor seniors who depend on Medicare, another 10 new taxes that hit the economy, and a perverse incentiveyou know, what is the essence of the healthcare bill in 30 seconds?  It says that if you employ 50 Americans or more, you must offer health insurance to the employees, comma, or pay a $2,000 fine.  But health insurance in America many times costs more than $2,000, giving a perverse incentive for these employers..."
89,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
90,REP. KIRK:  ...in 2014 to drop coverage.
91,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Mr.  Giannoulias, what is yourare you running on healthcare reform?  Is that something that you will stand by as passed by the Congress?"
92,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  I am running on jobs and Im running on helping small businesses.  And look, the healthcare bill was far from a perfect vehicle. That being said, I think it did some important things that the congressman wants to repeal:  the denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions, making sure that kids in between college and their first job have health care.  And I think morally we shouldnt have 51 million Americans without affordable basic health care.  The, the, the healthcare system as we have it right now, where we spend over 17 percent of our GDP on health care, is bankrupting our families, its bankrupting small businesses, bankrupting this country.  And, you know, the congressmans   got the talking points of $500 million in Medicare cuts.  The truth is, you know, a lot of Medicare expenditures are fraud, waste and abuse, and what this does is create efficiencies within Medicare, which is why the AARP and the AMA endorsed it.  But again, itsthere, theres a lot needs to be done.  I would have loved to have seen a, a provision there to let the secretary of Health and Human Services negotiate bulk drug rates for Medicare the way that the VA does.  So again, there was some missed opportunities in the implementation of healthcare...(unintelligible)."
93,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  I...
94,"REP. KIRK:  I would just say, by the way, coverage of pre-existing conditions was in our bill.  But when Ive lookedIve traveled throughout Illinois talking to the top hospital systems, and they will talk about these Medicare cuts as representing abetween a $30 million and $100 million cut per hospital across Illinois, leaving them to cancel capital expansion plans, hiring freezes, cuts, so that the effect of the cuts of your legislation are already being felt by state of Illinois healthcare institutions."
95,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
96,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  The difference, the difference is he wants to repeal it, I want to reform it and fix it and make sure that it works for small businesses and for families."
97,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me move on to some of the personal aspects of this race. Its been pretty nasty, negative tone by both of you.  Here was a poll in the Chicago Tribune/WGN.  Who do you consider more trustworthy or honest? Thirty-five, Giannoulias; 30 percent, Kirk; 16 percent, neither.  Cant be a figure that either one of you are proud of.  I, I want to go through some of the issues that have cropped up on both sides and allow you guys to, to talk through it."
98,"Mr.  Giannoulias, let me start with you.  Back in 2006 you were running for state treasurer.  This was part of an ad that you put on the air touting your record."
99,(Clip from campaign ad)
100,"MR. GREGORY:  Financial expert, businessman, banker.  Your family bank, the Broadway Bank, was seized by regulators.  It went under.  You released a statement earlier this year creating some distance from the bank and when it was closed.  And let me put the statement on the screen.  It was because my father instilled in his sons the importance of helping others that I decided to leave the bank in 2005and thats the key date here, 2005--to pursue public service.  At the time I left, according to every independent analysis, the bank was one of the best performing in Illinois."
101,"Now, the Chicago Tribune summarized some of the issues that are at stake here under this headline:  Giannoulias still worked at familys bank in 06; Candidate tells voters he left by late 2005.  Giannoulias tells voters he was gone from his troubled family bank by late 2005, but thats not what he told the IRS.  Giannoulias was able to take a $2.7 million tax deduction last year because he reported working hundreds of hours at Broadway Bank in 2006.  [He] says theres no contradiction.  ...  The issue highlights the fine line Giannoulias walks on the campaign trail in explaining exactly what he did at Broadway and when he did it.  ...  In this tight Senate race, the tenure as a senior loan officer at Broadway is a bulls-eye for critics who hit him for the banks loans to mob figures as well as troubled lending that contributed to Broadways collapse earlier this year.  Saying he left in 05 gives Giannoulias maximum distance from the banks questionable lending practices, the April takeover by federal regulators and other controversies such as a loan by the bank to convicted influence peddler Tony Rezko in early 2006.  But by reporting that he worked at least 500 hours at Broadway in 2006, Giannoulias was able to get a break that helped him avoid paying federal income tax in 2009."
102,"Can you clear this up?  Which is it?  When did you leave, and did you get a tax break you shouldnt have?"
103,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  Sure.  There arethere have been no inconsistencies in anything Ive said.  I left day-to-day operations in 05 and I fully left the bank in 2006.  Paid million dollarmillions of dollars in taxes over the last five years.  But this is not what people are talking about, David.  And when Iwhen you bring up the bank, you know, my father came to this country as an immigrant.  He started a community bank 30 years ago.  This was not some fly-by-night company.  It was his whole life, it was his whole legacy.  And hes helped thousands of people, thousands of people achieve the American dream.  But because of this devastating recession, weve seen more community banks go under than ever before.  Another almost thousand community banks are on the watch list.  And you know what?  While Im very fortunate and my familys very fortunate, I know what its like to lose a family business because of this, because of this recession."
104,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but lets get to the substantive point.  Why did you say that you left in 2005 but you still told the IRS that you were there working in 2006 in order to get the tax break?"
105,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  David, nothing I said has been inconsistent.  I said I left day-to-day operations in 2005.  And I fully left the bank..."
106,MR. GREGORY:  But you did work there in 2006?
107,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  Exactly.  As Ive, as Ive always said.  Nothing, nothing is inconsistent.  And I make my tax returns public.  Unlike the congressman, I make my tax returns public.  Everyone can see what I pay in taxes.  I paid my state treasurers salary in taxes.  Im getting a refund because of a, a widely known business, business failure, and Im giving that money to charity."
108,"MR. GREGORY:  Were you aware of some of the, the loan activity to criminal figures?"
109,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  Look, whatthe way a, a community bank does businessI know when you run for office, these stories get sensationalized.  When a bank decides who to give a loan to, they look at the credit worthiness of the borrower, they look at the credit scorer of the borrower, they look at the appraisal value of a property.  So any, any bank, of course there are some individuals thatwith colorful pasts that we didnt want to do business with. But that doesnt represent the thousands of people that..."
110,"MR. GREGORY:  But my question, Mr.  Giannoulias, were you aware that there were crime figures who were getting loans by your bank?"
111,MR. GIANNOULIAS:  As...
112,MR. GREGORY:  You were a loan officer there.
113,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  As I, as I continue to mention, as I continue to say, if I knew now what I knowif I knew then what I know now, these arent the kind of people that we do business with."
114,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
115,MR. GIANNOULIAS:  But thats not how banks work.
116,"MR. GREGORY:  So youre saying you didnt know, you didnt know?  I mean, thats the, thats the easy question.  Did you know that they were crime figures that your bank was loaning money to?"
117,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  As Ive said, I didntwe didnt know the extent of that activity.  But again, if you look at any bank..."
118,"MR. GREGORY:  You didnt know the extent, but you knew that they hadthat they were..."
119,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  If you knewDavid, if you look at, if you look at any bank, an even bigger bank, youre going to find hundreds of individuals that..."
120,"MR. GREGORY:  Thats not what Im asking.  Mr.  Giannoulias, did you know that they were crime figures that you were loaning money to?"
121,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  I didnt know the extent of their activity, of course not."
122,MR. GREGORY:  Didnt know the extent of it.
123,"Well, this is what youve said, Congressman Kirk, about all of this in your ads, and, and some things you said on television, to Fox News in February: Well, it appears that the Broadway Bank, which is the Giannoulias family bank, has extensive ties to the mob, to convicted felons. And you ranthis is a portion of the ad that youre running with the Senate committee, Republican committee."
124,(Clip from campaign ad)
125,MR. GREGORY:  Are you saying that he has ties to organized crime?
126,"REP. KIRK:  This is a list of all the bank loans to convicted mobsters and felons.  The ones in yellow are the ones where he was the senior loan officer of the bank; people like Michael Jaws Giorango, Demitri Stavropoulos, Boris Stratievsky.  There are all infamous mob figures and bankers who have very long and storied records.  And you dont have to pull their rap sheet, it was in the Chicago Tribune."
127,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  Again, this is the congressman whos never worked in the private sector, doesnt know thewhat it takeswhat a bank does when they look at whether or not to approve or deny a loan.  So he pulls some names and he tries to make it a, a political attack.  People arent buying it.  Thats why were up in the polls.  But this is whats wrong with politics.  Someone like Congressman Kirk, who has no idea what its like in the private sector, to go out there and say these are convicted mobsters, thats notthose arent the kind of people that..."
128,"MR. GREGORY:  But in the rough and tumble of a campaign, I mean, do you really stand by all of those ads saying that he hasI mean, hes sitting right here.  Does he have connections to organized crime, in your judgment? Or was there bad judgment made by the bank?"
129,"REP. KIRK:  The Broadway Bank provided an extraordinary amount of loan capital, totaled millions of dollars, to mob figures and convicted felons after they had been convicted.  And, and thats absolutely theyou know, I was in the private sector.  I did work.  But Ill tell you the private sector experience that I dont have.  I dont have experience in, in loaning money to mob figures.  I dont have experience in reckless loans to commercial real estate and brokered hot money deposits, leading to a collapse in the bank. The New York Times analysis of Treasurer Giannoulias work at the bank showed that it was his decisions that helped lead to this collapse."
130,MR. GIANNOULIAS:  Thats not true.  Thats...
131,REP. KIRK:  Transferring a $390 million bill onto the back of the FDIC.
132,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Let me give you the final word here, and then were going to take a break."
133,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  Again, we shouldnt be surprised that the congressman is lying again.  If you look at the loans that were past due when the bank was taken over, like thousands of, of community banks that are dealing with challenges, less than 9 percent of the loans were even around.  So its, its a political war, I understand that.  But for him to say thatto characterize my family that way is misleading, offensive.  People arent buying it.  And the congressman wouldnt know the difference because hes been in D.C. for 20 years."
134,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Were, were going to leave this issue here.  Were going to take a break.  There are some credibility questions that have been raised about some statements youve made, Congressman, in the course of the campaign.  Were going to take a break here and come back and deal with those. Right moreback with more of our Illinois Senate debate after this brief commercial break."
135,(Announcements)
136,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up, we continue our debate with the two candidates vying for the Senate seat once held by President Obama after this brief commercial break."
137,(Announcements)
138,"MR. GREGORY:  We are back to continue our debate with the candidates battling to become the next U.S. senator from Illinois, a seat once held by President Obama."
139,"Congressman Kirk, there have been some credibility issues raised on the campaign trail for you as well, and it has to do with your military record. You hold the rank of commander, youre in the Naval Reserve as an intelligence officer.  You served during the conflicts of Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti, Bosnia; awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal for Kosovo service in 1999; all of which makes it curious some of the exaggerations in the course of the campaign trail.  This is how the Associated Press summarizes it back in June, Ill put it on the screen:  Kirks problems began with the revelation that his frequent references to being named the Navys intelligence officer of the year were false.  Instead, a lightly different award had gone to the intelligence unit that Kirk led, not to Kirk personally.  That was followed by a long string of other errors and exaggerations.  A letter from his office said he served in the Gulf War when he didnt. The first Gulf War.  He has also referred to serving in the invasion of Iraq, although his duties kept him stateside.  He said his Reserve work sometimes includes running the Pentagon war room, even though he overseas only the intelligence operations.  Although he had clearly described coming under fire while flying missions over Kosovo and Iraq, Kirk began to hedge and say that he couldnt be sure his plane was targeted by the anti-aircraft fire.  And he didnt mention that he rode along on only a handful of flightsperhaps just three.  Kirks campaign also denied he had ever improperly mingled political activity with his military duties, only to have the Pentagon confirm that he had done exactly that on two occasions."
140,"There was also an interview you gave to the Chicago Sun-Times during whichthat youd come under fire, that youd been shot at while in Kandahar, only to have that account contradicted by your statementssomething that was on your own Web site earlier in the year.  So my question is, given your own military record, why would you exaggerate these?"
141,"REP. KIRK:  Well, I made mistakes with regard to my military misstatements, I was careless, and, and I learned a very painful and humbling lesson.  This is very important to me.  Iin my Naval training as a Naval officer, we are trained to take command, to be responsible, to be accountable for our personnel, for our unit and our mission.  And I am completely accountable for this.  And so I corrected the record..."
142,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but, but how dohow does one get careless on that?  I mean, if youve served overseas, and you have, anybody whos in combat is very clear on whether they were in combat or not.  So, you know, if youre a voter and youre listening to this, should there not be some credibility test for you?  Should that have some weight in whether you can be trusted, if youre going to exaggerate your military record, something that sensitive?"
143,"REP. KIRK:  There certainly should be.  And, and the level of scrutiny here is completely appropriate because this is a very high office.  For me, what I did is first correct the record, then apologize to the people of Illinois. Then I released all 21 years of my officer fitness reports, these are my confidential personnel files, to everyone so that they could read.  Im very proud of my record.  Ive served in Afghanistan, in Northern Watch and Operation Allied Force.  I believe in this country very greatly, and I would give my life for it."
144,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
145,REP. KIRK:  I think its made me a better congressman and a better advocate.
146,"MR. GREGORY:  But bottom line, Congressman, did you say that you were once shot at when in fact you were not?"
147,"REP. KIRK:  Well, for example, when youre flying over Iraq as a big NATO strike package..."
148,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
149,"REP. KIRK:  ...usually the Iraqis opened up on us.  But whether the squadron came under fire or not, its a very confusing..."
150,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
151,"Mr.  Giannoulias, youve called him a liar in his ads.  I mean, its a very serious charge.  Do you accept his explanation?"
152,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  Well, again, thats for the congressman to explain to the voters of Illinois.  But even more troubling than the, the untruths about his military record and his phantom teaching career, more troubling to me are his votes in thein Washington, D.C. Heres someone who you dont know where he stands.  The Chicago Sun-Times pointed out on Friday, you dont know where he stands on important issues.  Now, David, the people of Illinois may not always agree with everything I say, but theyll always know where I stand. Congressman Kirk votes for cap and trade, and he said hes doing it for the national security interests of the United States; and then he runs as a Republican for the Senate and says he would never vote that way again, it was a huge mistake.  They asked him his thoughts on the Dream Act, Dont Ask Dont Tell, he said hes not sure yet."
153,"Ill tell you where I stand, and thats leadership.  Thats what the people of Illinois want.  Thats what Ill give them for the rest of my career.  And I think that is a, a fundamental difference in principles, in values and morals, between myself and the congressman."
154,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to close with this thought.  Were in partnership with Facebook and their politics page, and weve solicited a question from Dmitri Morris, and its interesting.  IllCongressman Kirk, Ill start with you on this.  Name two issues in your partys platform that you do not agree with and why?"
155,"REP. KIRK:  For example, I backed stem-cell research.  I very much support hate crimes legislation; when it went through the House, it was the Conyers-Kirk Bill.  I also supported health insurance for low income kids through the SCHIP program.  Been rated as one of the most independent members of Congress; a fiscal conservative, a social moderate."
156,MR. GREGORY:  Mr.  Giannoulias?
157,MR. GIANNOULIAS:  I...
158,"MR. GREGORY:  Two areas of the Democratic Party you dont agree with, where youd buck your party."
159,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  Well, as I mentioned, the way TARP was handled I think was an enormouslywe missed, we missed..."
160,MR. GREGORY:  But the Republicans started that.
161,"MR. GIANNOULIAS:  We missed, missedtheres a missed opportunity.  I think I wouldve loved to have seen increased access to capital requirements on these banks, that they lend money out.  When we fought and saved jobs at Hart Schaffner Marx, one of the things we did was go after Wells Fargo.  We looked at them and said, listen, you cant let this company falter, you cant let them fail.  And Iyou know, the, the congressman always uses the word independent.  The truth is the only thing hes been independent of in this race is the truth.  This is an incredibly important race.  We need some fresh leadership, we need some new ideas, we need to help create jobs.  People in Illinois are getting crushed, crushed by this recession.  Washington, D.C., isnt working.  And my question is why in the world do we send the same people who created this mess back to Washington, D.C.?  Thats why the people of Illinois need, need some new ideas and some fresh voices."
162,"MR. GREGORY:  The debate will continue.  The campaign will continue in crunch time now.  Good luck to both of you, and thank you for sharing your views here with us this morning on MEET THE PRESS."
163,"REP. KIRK:  Thank you, David."
164,"MR. GREGORY:  We will be watching closely, of course."
165,"And coming up here next, we will have our political roundtable and talk about some of the big issues that continue on the campaign trail.  Well have more from the campaign trail next week; the Colorado Democratic Senator Michael Bennet will square off with Republican and tea party favorite Ken Buck. Thats our Senate debate series coming up next week here on MEET THE PRESS."
166,"And up next, the big picture in the midterm fight:  new jobless numbers, tight races across the nation, another high-level Obama administration departure. How will it all impact the campaigns?  Our roundtable weighs in, Time magazines Joe Klein and Wall Street Journals Peggy Noonan, after this brief station break."
167,(Announcements)
168,"MR. GREGORY:  Were back.  We turn to our roundtable to get some perspective on todays debate, as well as all the other issues were looking at as we get closer to November.  Joining me now:  Time magazine columnist Joe Klein, whose most recent piece is the cover story on this weeks issue of the magazine, which is very compelling; and author of What I Saw at the Revolution:  A Political Life in the Reagan Era, The Wall Street Journals Peggy Noonan. Plenty to get to this morning."
169,"And, Joe, here was the Bloomberg headline this week:  Dodging Embarrassment Tops Obama Agenda in the Illinois Senate Race. He is involved in this race. He has been campaigning for Giannoulias.  Theres a lot here on the line for him."
170,MR. JOE KLEIN:  Yes.  And Giannoulias just said he didnt know the full extent of the criminal activity of people that his bank was giving loans to? I dont think Ive ever seen a politician say anything like that before.
171,"MR. GREGORY:  Its, its part of what has been such a negative campaign, Peggy.  And we put this on the screen now, its, its a tight race in part, you know, perhaps because of Congressman Kirks, you know, statements about his military record; but Giannoulias, in some quarters, is seen as more of a flawed candidate, and perhaps that, that answer is going to dog him."
172,"MS. PEGGY NOONAN:  Yeah, I think it might.  Look, it is a veryone of the things that turns off people about politics is that it can be so negative, so personal.  They know as they look at their own lives, anything they did could be made into something huge, negative and bad if it were turned into a 60-second spot.  And a lot of people running for office this year do not want to talk about issues or do not want to talk about their past stands on issues, and so theyre just pounding each other personally.  He lied, she lied, he did this.  It lowers everything and is not fortunate during a crisis."
173,"MR. KLEIN:  It does, yeah.  It seem..."
174,"MR. GREGORY:  Does Obama help him, though, here?  Hes, hes really been aggressive in campaigning.  Is there an Obama effect in Illinois?"
175,"MR. KLEIN:  Well, Obamaslisten, I, I was in Kirks old district during this road trip, and Obama has like 60 percent--59, 60 percent approval in that district, ayou know, a district thats gone for Republicans in the past. Obamas still very popular in, in Illinois."
176,"But I want to pick up on what, what Peggy said.  And the amazing thing to me about this debate is how much it is at variance with the way people are actually feeling in this country."
177,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
178,"MR. KLEIN:  They are freaked out, theyre panicked.  Theyre really scared that the jobs that weve lost are not coming back this time, and that their kids wont live as well as they have.  And instead of this kind of tit-for-tat political stuff that you see in all the negative ads, they want to hear real ideas about how were, how were going to rebuild the economy."
179,"MR. GREGORY:  To that point, herethe cover piece I just mentioned.  This is a portion of it that, that I thought was so interesting.  You write this:  I found the same themes dominant everywherea rethinking of basic assumptions, a moment of national introspection.  There was a unanimous sense that Washington was broken beyond repair, which I just want to underline.  But the disgraceful behavior of the financial community, and its debilitating effects on the American economy over the past 30 years, was the issue that raised the most passion, by far, in the middle of the country. Its as if to say Americans are saying, who do we trust now?"
180,"MR. KLEIN:  Right, exactly.  I mean, the investment community, people are putting two and two together.  The same people who did the mergers and acquisitions that led to a lot of these jobs being shipped overseas are thethen turned their attention to the housing market and began giving, with the help of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, these mortgages to people who shouldnt have gotten them and then created these crazy financial products, made a gazillion dollars off them, and then theand, and caused the crash of 2008."
181,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
182,"MR. KLEIN:  So people are looking at the financial community, theyre looking at China, and theyre not seeing the president of the United States or the Republicans really talking about this."
183,MS. NOONAN:  So true.
184,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Peggy, to that point, I mean, you, you havelook, youve got some populism, youve got the tea party, youve got Christine ODonnell. Some of these candidates come out of a place of deep economic anxiety that could be prolonged.  I mean, there could be a real effect on our politics of prolonged unemployment and economic malaise."
185,"MS. NOONAN:  Yeah, there could.  Look, I thinkJoe and I were talking before we came outthe biggest change politically in my entire lifetime is the fact that the American people now no longer feel that they will be handing on to their country a stronger, better place where their kids will get a job and their kids can get a house.  TheI wouldnt call it pessimism, but a new sober, almost sadness is out there..."
186,MR. GREGORY:  Hm.
187,"MS. NOONAN:  ...and I think in part is shaping things.  Nobody expects the kind of economic growth that we are going to need to produce enough jobs not only for everybody to keep their job, but for young people coming up, the new people, to keep these jobs."
188,"MR. GREGORY:  And you writein the, in the preface to the new book you talk about Reagan and that sense of optimism and belief in the future."
189,MS. NOONAN:  Yeah.
190,"MR. GREGORY:  And our, our recent poll indicated that whats really tough is not only that so many people are out of work, they dont have much faith in the presidents policies to turn things around.  That is kind of a death knell for a political party or for a president."
191,"MS. NOONAN:  Yes.  And I think part of whats coming in just a few weeks in November is, is probably a rebuke..."
192,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
193,"MS. NOONAN:  ...of our current leadership, and I, and I think that might be fairly severe.  But the larger issue is that I dont think the American people look at Washington and see people who, A, can know what needs to be done; and B, can actually summon the will and grit to do it.  They dont see that leadership..."
194,MR. KLEIN:  Thats right.
195,"MS. NOONAN:  ...as likely, and so they are frustrated because, you know, they hire leaders to make things better.  And now they dont feel, whoever they hire, itll get better."
196,"MR. GREGORY:  What, what is the dominant feeling or sentiment you hear expressed out there about the president himself?"
197,"MR. KLEIN:  Well, I didnt go through the deep South wherewhich is very red, and I also didnt go into urban neighborhoods, which are very blue.  I went down diagonally across the center part..."
198,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  We have the map we can show, actually, of your travels."
199,"MR. KLEIN:  Oh, really?"
200,"MR. GREGORY:  Yes, yes."
201,"MR. KLEIN:  I likedo I want to remember this?  But anyway, people respect him.  You dont see the fist-shaking anger that you often see on cable news. Certainly, theres some Obama haters out there.  Most people respect him, but they dont quite admire him.  Hes floating over this debate in anyou know, and, and doesnt seem to be part of the things that people are most concerned about.  They dont understand whats in the health reform legislation, they dont understand whats in the financial reform regulation.  Theyre beginning to see the stimulus in a different way because you cant drive 30 miles in this country without hitting a road crew.  And theyre feeling a little bit better about the auto bailout.  But they feel that the big issues that were talking about herethe jobs being expressed overseas, Chinathey havent heard from him.  For every time someone mentioned Afghanistan, the war in Afghanistan, which is an issue Ive been obsessed with, they mentioned China 25 times."
202,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
203,MS. NOONAN:  Can I say...
204,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
205,"MS. NOONAN:  ...that I, I think the issue, the way I would put it with regard to the president, is a certain off-pointness.  The country has consistently bebeen talking about and thinking about A, B, and C, and hes on some other letters of the alphabet.  And even when he comes forward, I think the past week when he is on the stump, the issues that hes speaking of seem extraneous to the central issues and anxieties."
206,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but is there a confidence, though, Peggy, is there confidence in the Republican Party?"
207,MS. NOONAN:  Oh.
208,"MR. GREGORY:  In other words, the frustration I hear is..."
209,MR. KLEIN:  No.
210,MS. NOONAN:  No.
211,"MR. GREGORY:  Right, that we dont see it now."
212,"MS. NOONAN:  No, I got to tell you..."
213,MR. KLEIN:  No.
214,MS. NOONAN:  ...its part of the sadness.
215,"MR. GREGORY:  But the frustration I hear is that we dont have people in Washington who are real problem solvers, who are willing to speak like adults to other adults and say this is what has to happen."
216,MS. NOONAN:  Yeah.
217,MR. KLEIN:  Thats right.
218,"MS. NOONAN:  I think, look, the rise of the tea party, the great cliche weve all been talking about, is very interesting, very evolving, very changing. But its most interesting element is that it is not only a reaction to Democratic Party leadership, it is a critique of the past 10 years of Republican leadership."
219,MR. GREGORY:  Hm.
220,MS. NOONAN:  The Republican Party will either evolve and change in some interesting ways...
221,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
222,MS. NOONAN:  ...along with the tea party or not.
223,MR. KLEIN:  Here...
224,MS. NOONAN:  But are the voters saying I love the Republicans?
225,MR. GREGORY:  Not yet.
226,"MS. NOONAN:  No, they are not."
227,"MR. GREGORY:  Hang onto that thought.  I want to showSarah Palin was speaking last night, and its so interesting, some of what she said and the following that she has.  I want to play just a piece of her speech, because it gets to what may be next.  This is what she said."
228,(Videotape)
229,"FMR. GOV. SARAH PALIN (R-AK):  I get to say some things that maybe some of you cant say because I have no title, I have no uniform, I have no office. You know, its Todd and me and were traveling.  I get to say what I feel, and Im going to speak for some of you who may be thinking it but cant say it."
230,(End videotape)
231,"MR. GREGORY:  What does she represent, Joe?  I mean, is sheshe talked about a Reagan-like revival, you know, on the right.  Is she running?"
232,"MR. KLEIN:  She, she may well be running.  She represents maybe 30 percent of the population.  I mean, from what I saw, the tea party had an enormous impact within the Republican Party but not beyond it, and maybe to, to some independents."
233,"If this can be described very, very briefly, people think thethey know what the Republicans stand for:  lower taxes, less government, less regulation. They have no idea what the Democrats stand for, except for these big, slovenly pieces of legislation that weve seen which inevitably contain ridiculous provisions.  One candidate in, in Nevada, a Republican running for Congress, said that theres a provision in the healthcare reform bill that small businesses have to set aside areas for breast-feeding women to use their breast pumps.  My dad was a small businessman.  He didnt need to be told by the government to do that."
234,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
235,"MR. KLEIN:  He would have just said, Use my office."
236,MR. GREGORY:  Weve got less thanwe have about 30 seconds.  Whats the dynamic in the next 20 some odd days before the election that may impact the results?
237,MS. NOONAN:  That may impact the result.  I do think the result is probably pretty set.  I think its going to be a rising up against huge spending.  At least the American people feel maybe they can put some pressure on politicians to start to control federal government spending.
238,MR. GREGORY:  And to contract government when its not held in very high esteem.
239,"MR. KLEIN:  Yeah.  And thats, thats a conundrum because when you talk to people out there, the deficit vs.  stimulus argument that goes on here in Washington is settled.  People would rather have the government spending money on job programs that actually work than on deficit reduction, which theyve never really cared about in any case, although they say so when things arent going well."
240,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
241,"MS. NOONAN:  But they have a sense its out of control, the spending, at the same time.  They do.  That its too big.  Deficitsoh, my God, when you get into the Ts, trillions, youre in trouble."
242,MR. GREGORY:  Thats a good place to end.  Thank you both very much.  We will leave it there and we will be right back.
243,(Announcements)
244,"MR. GREGORY:  That is all for today.  Be sure to join us next week when we continue our Senate debate series.  We will turn our attention to Colorado, where Democratic incumbent Senator Michael Bennet is locked in a tight battle with Republican challenger, tea party favorite, Ken Buck.  If its Sunday, its MEET THE PRESS."

16,(Videotape)
17,MS. SHARRON ANGLE:  How did you become so wealthy on a government payroll?
18,REP. HARRY REID (D-NV):  That's really kind of a low blow.  I think most everyone knows I was a very successful lawyer.
19,(End videotape)
20,"MR. GREGORY:  And in Delaware, GOP candidate Christine O'Donnell down in the polls but still grabbing the headlines."
21,(Videotape)
22,MR. CHRIS COONS:  What would you do in Washington?
23,"MS. CHRISTINE O'DONNELL:  You're just jealous that you weren't on ""Saturday Night Live."""
24,"MR. COONS:  I'm dying to see who's going to play me, Christine."
25,(End videotape)
26,"MR. GREGORY:  One of the tight races that could tip the balance of power is in Colorado, where recent polls show a single-digit race.  As our special Senate debate series continues this morning, we are joined by Colorado Senator Democrat Michael Bennet for a showdown with his challenger, Republican Ken Buck."
27,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
28,"MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.  Today, for the first time this election season, the president and the first lady hit the campaign trail together, heading to Ohio to stump for Governor Ted Strickland and attend a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee.  But with just 16 days until the election, is there anything the president can do to stop Republicans from a major victory on November 2?  Joining me now, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs."
29,Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
30,"MR. ROBERT GIBBS:  Thank you for having me, David."
31,"MR. GREGORY:  We are just 16 days away, and there was something in The Washington Post that really caught my eye, that kind of summed up the difficulty for the president and for Democrats.  I'll put it up on the screen. And it's about the West Virginia Senate race and hopeful Joe Manchin.  The headline, he's got one problem, ""That pesky `D' after his name.  This year Manchin has one problem he can't fix.  `There's not much wrong with him,' said John Jenks, attending [an event for the Republican John Raese] on Wednesday. `It's just that he is a Democrat.'"" Why is that such a problem?"
32,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, look, there's different political environments in different states.  But understand, David, the overall political environment is driven by our overall economic picture.  It took us years to get into the mess that we got ourselves in at the end of 2008, and it's going to take a while to get us out.  We lost eight million jobs, we saw a financial system near collapse, we have a continuing housing crisis that we're making progress on dealing with. We have positive economic growth, and we've had nine straight months of private sector job growth.  It's just going to take a while to get out of the mess that took us a long time to get into."
33,"MR. GREGORY:  Just this morning, though, AP story out showing a poll, many Obama 2008 supporters defecting to the GOP.  This has, in many ways, become a referendum on the president and his policies."
34,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, I will say this, I'm a little leery of polls that take three weeks to conduct, just as a political professional.  But, again, we're in a tough political environment because the country's in a tough economic environment.  It's 9.6 percent unemployment, again, eight million jobs that have been lost.  But, you know, look, we've got candidates that are out there making their positive case because we know exactly what the Republican Party wants to do, David.  They said it sitting probably right here in the chair I'm sitting in.  They want to go back exactly to what we had in 2008.  They want to start by repealing things like Wall Street reform and putting banks back in charge of making financial decisions that affect not just Wall Street, but affect Main Street.  I think at the end of the day people are going to understand that message and not turn over control of Congress to people that want to take us back to what we're trying to get out of."
35,"MR. GREGORY:  Last time you were here, you made a little news, you raised some eyebrows by what you said.  And I want to play what you said, but I want to play it in the full context and have you talk about it, give a--give an updated version of it.  Let me--this was about the election landscape."
36,"(Videotape, July 11, 2010)"
37,"MR. GREGORY:  Is the House in jeopardy, the majority for the Democrats in the House in jeopardy?"
38,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, I, I think there are--no doubt that there are a lot of seats that will be up, a lot of contested seats.  I think people are going to have a choice to make in the fall.  But I think there's no doubt there are enough seats in play that could cause Republicans to gain control.  There's no doubt about that."
39,(End videotape)
40,"MR. GREGORY:  You also went on to say that there's--it will depend on how strong the campaigns are by Democrats.  First of all, what--how do you see the landscape now?"
41,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, again, I--it's a--there's no question it is a tough and challenging political environment.  We're the beneficiary of a lot of political real estate after 2006 and 2008 that haven't been held by Democrats for a long period of time.  But look, I, I think that campaigns in this cycle are being run on a lot of local issues and issues that are important, not nationally, but to individual states and independent, independent--individual congressional districts.  I think our candidates have done a remarkably good job in a tough political environment, and I think that, come election night, we'll retain control of both the House and the Senate."
42,MR. GREGORY:  You believe that?
43,MR. GIBBS:  I do believe that.
44,MR. GREGORY:  What's different now as opposed to then?
45,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, again, I think right now you see an electorate by Democrats that is actually more engaged.  You mentioned the president out on the trail. He's joined today by a very popular first lady in a--in an important state like Ohio.  Twenty-thousand people signed up on Deval Patrick's Web site for the event that we had yesterday, 26,000 people in Wisconsin.  There's an excitement about what this president is trying to do, there's an energy around it.  And we're seeing that in shrinking generic congressional ballots, and we're seeing that in a shrinking enthusiasm gap."
46,"MR. GREGORY:  The president on the trail, as you mentioned, has some pointed messages.  And I want to show just a portion of one of his talks here on Tuesday."
47,"(Videotape, October 12, 2010)"
48,PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  The question is going to be whether once again hope overcomes fear.  Because what essentially the other side has decided is that they're going to try to ride fear and anxiety all the way to the ballot box on November 2.
49,(End videotape)
50,"MR. GREGORY:  He's accusing Republicans of riding fear and anxiety to the ballot box, and yet, with his talk about the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce and influence of foreign money, a lot of people question whether he's, in fact, guilty of the same thing.  This is what the president said back in October in Maryland."
51,"(Videotape, October 7, 2010)"
52,"PRES. OBAMA:  Just this week we learned that one of the largest groups paying for these ads regularly takes in money from foreign corporations.  So groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections.  And they won't tell you where the money for their ads come from. So this isn't just a threat to Democrats.  All Republicans should be concerned, independents should be concerned.  This is a threat to our Democracy."
53,(End videotape)
54,"MR. GREGORY:  A threat to our democracy, yet the White House has not produced proof of any foreign funds in the ads.  And this is what The Washington Post said about this general issue.  The headline:  ""Secret campaign money,"" that foreign donations are not the problem.  ""The gusher of secret money,"" they say in the editorial, ""pouring into the coming election is alarming.  It should be plugged for future campaigns--and could be, with the switch of a Senate seat or two.  But the rhetoric about this development, from President Obama on down, is irresponsibly alarmist.  ...  Bruce Josten"" with the Chamber of Commerce, he's chief lobbyist, ""told The New York Times that the chamber's 115 foreign affiliates pay less than $100,000 in membership dues, out of a total budget of $200 million.  The foreign money is kept in segregated accounts. The White House seems willing to stoke"" xenophebia--""xenophobia without any evidence for its accusations."""
55,"MR. GIBBS:  David, I, I think if you look at what the president said, he was extremely careful.  You've got a group that does take money from foreign countries--from, from companies in, in other countries.  They are running $75 million worth of ads.  David, you and I don't know exactly who's contributing to that because there's a program that keeps all of their donors and--involved in these ads a complete secret.  You're not going to know today, you're not going to know tomorrow, you're not going to know after the election.  What's the agenda of those that would contribute and write million-dollar checks to influence races like in Colorado or throughout the country?  What's their political agenda?  And this is solved quite easily.  Bruce Josten, the chief lobbyist, could simply open up the books, could simply show people exactly where the donations are coming from and who's paying for the ads.  And I have to say, David, it, it's a pretty easy political solution to simply show the American people where the money's coming from.  And since it's been a week and a half or two weeks into this debate and they haven't shown you where the money is, it, it calls into question where that money comes from."
56,"MR. GREGORY:  But isn't it striking to you, Robert, that an administration that passed healthcare reform, financial regulation, a massive stimulus to try to, you know, grow the economy, is in itself using a fear tactic here a couple weeks before the election, talking about Karl Rove, talking about the Chamber of Commerce and secret money into the campaign?"
57,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, again, it's just a fact.  Karl Rove, who believed, quite frankly, that outside money in the 2004 race had the potential to derail our democracy before he started running a group that I think we now both agree has the potential to derail democracy.  Karl's group is spending $50 million, the chamber is spending $75 million.  If you add up all the conservative groups and what they've pledged to spend in this race, it's $399 million.  Nobody knows who those donors are.  Nobody knows what their political agenda is. What do they want from the next senator or from the next congressman?  It does have the potential to derail our democracy, $400 million injected into this political campaign with no idea."
58,MR. GREGORY:  But this is still a lot more smoke than fact.  Isn't that fair?
59,"MR. GIBBS:  No.  Absolutely not.  Again, we could, we could know all the facts by simply having Karl Rove and others lay out exactly where their donors come from and exactly where that money--what the agenda is behind those big checks."
60,"MR. GREGORY:  But isn't the bigger issue here than Karl Rove, this poll question that Bloomberg asked earlier this month, whether people believed that children in your life will have a better life than you had?  Fifty-one percent say they're just somewhat or not confident in that.  The faith in President Obama and making a better future was very high when he came into office, and here's where it stands now."
61,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, look, I don't doubt that there are concerns throughout this country and there's a deep frustration, and you can include the Oval Office in that, and getting our economy moving again.  The president works every day not to do what is politically popular, but what--to do what is right.  Investing in auto companies and ensuring a financial collapse didn't lead not from a recession to a great depression may not have been the most popular thing to do, but it was the right thing to do.  And every step of the way, David, in, in facing economic catastrophe, Republicans said no.  The people in this country, in order to affect their outlook on the future, need a party in the Republicans that's willing to come be part of Democracy and be part of government."
62,"I don't doubt that as we look through the messages of what happens on Election Day, regardless of the outcome, the American people are going to want two political parties to work together to solve our problems.  And, quite frankly, from the very get-go, from the very first day there was a coordinated strategy by Mitch McConnell and the Republicans to simply say no to everything that President Obama wanted to do, and now we know why.  Because they want to go back to what happened in 2008 and 2007."
63,"Look, Karl Rove is the architect in many of these outside groups, and I think it's pretty emblematic of wanting to take us back to the Bush years."
64,"MR. GREGORY:  Do, do you call on Democratic candidates, like Joe Manchin, like a dozen or so blue dog Democrats in a Congress to rebuff their support from the chamber of commerce that they have in, in this race?"
65,"MR. GIBBS:  Look, the chamber has a--has certainly a constitutionally protected right to air ads.  Nobody's arguing that they can't be involved in the election.  But the president has said, and not just in the last two weeks, David, the president said this at the State of the Union in criticizing the Supreme Court's decision that groups that support Democrats and groups that support Republicans, liberal or conservative, ought to simply tell the American people where they get their money.  Who's paying for the millions and millions..."
66,MR. GREGORY:  But you're not concerned about Democrats getting support from the chamber?
67,"MR. GIBBS:  No.  Look, the, the, the chamber supported the president's recovery plan.  The president--we would liked to have had the chamber's support in dealing with small business tax cuts that Republicans opposed and took us three months longer to get than it should have.  We would, quite frankly, have liked the chamber's support on commonsense Wall Street reform that starts to put Main Street back in charge and not held hostage by Wall Street.  Again, there was a coordinated effort not to have that happen, not because it was right for the American people, but because it was all a series of political points."
68,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to ask you about a, a big news item this week, and that is the, the issue of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy in the military.  The president speaking on Thursday at an MTV town hall said this:"
69,(Videotape)
70,"PRES. OBAMA:  I've said very clearly, including in a State of the Union address, that I'm against ""don't ask, don't tell"" and that we're going to end this policy."
71,(End videotape)
72,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet, on that very day the president's Justice Department filed an appeal to halt a judge's ruling that would have struck down ""don't ask, don't tell."" So, if the president wants the law to go away, if he wants the ban to go away, why is he still supporting the law in the courts?"
73,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, let's be clear, the president believes the law is discriminatory, unjust and, quite frankly, you have men and women who are willing to lay down their life for this country.  They--those people ought to be able to serve.  The law that was struck down that the president opposes, we, we've got a process.  One, the House has passed repeal, and we hope the Senate takes up that repeal quickly.  They didn't."
74,MR. GREGORY:  But what if the Senate does?  Is there faith in the Senate that's misplaced?  What does the president do if the Senate doesn't act?
75,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, we have a process in place right now to work with the Pentagon for an orderly and disciplined transition from the law that we have now to an era that ""don't ask, don't tell"" doesn't exist.  And I will say this, David, ""don't ask, don't tell"" will end under this president.  The courts have decided, the legislature has, has--is beginning to decide, and the president is firmly in the place of removing ""don't ask, don't tell."""
76,MR. GREGORY:  But does he believe it's unconstitutional?
77,"MR. GIBBS:  You know, David, he thinks it's discriminatory and it's unjust and most of all it harms our national security.  It's..."
78,"MR. GREGORY:  We know his position, though.  But if you keep defending..."
79,MR. GIBBS:  ...it's time for the law...
80,"MR. GREGORY:  ...it in the courts, how does it end?  You can pronounce it dead, but how does it end if you keep backing it in the courts?"
81,"MR. GIBBS:  Yeah, well, it ends with a vote in Congress.  It's a law, and the most durable solution is to repeal that law.  That's what the president asked the House to do and they did, that's what the president--I think there's enough votes to do it in the Senate.  But, again, we have to get through Republican filibuster.  It harms our national security.  It's discriminatory, it's time for it to end.  And I will say this, David, again, this president will end ""don't ask, don't tell,"" and I think the courts--you're seeing from the courts that their deciding that ""don't ask, don't tell,"" quite frankly, is--has--it's time for it to end, and that time is coming very soon."
82,"MR. GREGORY:  This is the Sunday New York Times Magazine, it's called ""The Education of A President."" And it talks about the president and the White House's vision for what happens after November 2, whether you lose control or the House or the Senate or you don't.  If it's a slimmer majority.  And there's a portion of the article, written by Peter Baker, I'll put it up on the screen."
83,"""While proud of his record, Obama has already begun thinking about what went wrong -- and what he needs to do to change course for the next two years.  He has spent what one aide called `a lot of time talking about Obama 2.0.'"""

85,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, look, there's a couple of different things.  We've got to address problems that sit before us.  We have a medium and long-term fiscal situation that we all understand is unsustainable, and it's only going to be solved if the two parties are willing to work together.  We've got to take steps to continue education reform.  And most importantly we, we've passed some important legislation that creates a foundation for long-term economic growth, Wall Street reform, and healthcare reform.  And it's going to take a lot of coordinated energy and work to implement those.  I think that's what the president--you'll see the folk--president focused on in the next two years regardless, quite frankly, of the outcome of this election."
86,"MR. GREGORY:  But what about--how do you say to the voters, ""I hear you, there's going to be some kind of course correction."" What does that look like?"
87,"MR. GIBBS:  Well, I think we'll have time to figure out exactly what is said after the election when we know the final results.  Right now the president's focus is on getting our economy stronger and strengthened and moving forward, as he's out there making the case for, for democrats in this election."
88,MR. GREGORY:  You said you'd never trade the job of press secretary.  Do you stick by that or might you be elsewhere in the administration or in Washington?
89,"MR. GIBBS:  You know, David, and I think you would pretty easily agree with this, it is a tremendous honor and privilege to walk into that building every morning to serve this president, to serve any president.  I am happy with what I do.  I'd love to be the manager of the Atlanta Braves, but they hired somebody this week.  So I'll just have to be inordinately happy with one of the best jobs on the planet."

125,"MR. GREGORY:  He is challenging Bennet, the freshman senator and former head of Denver's schools, who was appointed to the seat after Ken Salazar joined the Obama Cabinet.  Their campaign, among the most contentious in the country, mirrors the national debate:  Has government helped or hurt in the ""great recession,"" and who can voters really trust to fix what's broken in Washington?"
126,"And joining us now, the current junior senator from Colorado, the Democrat, Michael Bennet, and his challenger, Republican Ken Buck, who is still the district attorney of Weld County, Colorado.  That was my mistake, I apologize. Welcome to both of you."
127,"And this is a debate that matters.  If you look at the polling, we'll put it up on the screen, the latest Denver Post/KUSA poll, it's a tight race with Mr. Buck with a 5 point advantage right now, both of you under 50 percent, so a lot on the line here."
128,"Mr. Buck, let me start with you because you do have tea party backing.  The tea party is a major movement in this midterm campaign, whether it's Sharron Angle in Nevada, Christine O'Donnell getting a lot of headlines in Delaware. And the question is whether the tea party represents an extreme, insurgent political force, or whether it's a legitimate political movement.  What do you say?"
129,"MR. BUCK:  I, I think it's a legitimate political movement.  I think what we're talking about are folks that are frustrated that we are spending so much money in Washington, D.C., and they're every bit as frustrated with the Republicans as they are with the Democrats, because the Republicans are every bit as much to blame for the mess that we're in as the Democrats.  And, and that frustration has exhibited itself in a lot of energy.  Folks are, are not going to try to send the same type of Republican to Washington, D.C., that they've sent in the past.  And so I think it is a lot more mainstream than it has been portrayed."
130,"MR. GREGORY:  But, you know, it's--is that point, there are a lot of folks who, supported by the tea party, in the tea party, say, `Oh, there's a mainstream movement.' But there are others who say it is anything but.  As a matter of fact, the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights and the NAACP are releasing a report this coming week.  And here it is, I'll show it on the screen.  The ""Tea Party Nationalism, a critical examination of the Tea Party movement and the size, scope and focus of its national factions."" And there are some serious charges that I want you to respond to.  ""The result of this study contravenes many of the Tea Parties' self-invented myths, particularly their sole concentration on budget deficits, taxes, and the power of the federal government.  Instead, this report found Tea Party ranks to be permeated with concerns about race and national identity and other so-called social issues.  ...  Tea party organization have given platforms to anti-Semites, racists and bigots, Further, hard-core white nationalists have been attracted to these protests, looking for potential recruits and hoping to push these (white) protestors toward a more self-conscious and ideological white supremacy."" If you're senator, do you think these elements in the tea party need to be dealt with and need to be rebuffed?"
131,"MR. BUCK:  Absolutely.  First of all, I haven't seen it.  I've been to over 800 events in Colorado in, in the last 20 months.  I have not seen that.  And, and I find it offensive that folks would try to label the tea party in that way.  It's just not true in Colorado.  I don't know if it's true in other states, I haven't been to the other states.  But I can tell you that if there are people that hold those views, they are quickly asked to leave meetings.  I have not seen them in, in meetings."
132,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator, is this a legitimate question?  Is this a mainstream movement?  Because this is high stakes in your, in your campaign, in this debate."
133,"SEN. BENNET:  Yeah.  Well, you know, David, over the last 22 months, I've had town halls in every part of our state, red and blue, and said the same thing in all those places.  And what I'll tell you is this, my favorite rooms are the ones where there are Democrats, Republicans, unaffiliated voters, and tea party people, because when folks are together in a room, they actually have to listen to each other.  I think one of the things that we are facing right now is that we've stopped listening to each other in our politics.  So I haven't seen a lot of that either, and I have had the opportunity to engage with people who are self-described tea party people, to have a serious conversation rather than just a bunch of slogans about how we are not going to become--you know, what, what we need to do so that we're not the first generation of Americans who leave less opportunity, not more, to our kids and our grandkids."
134,"MR. GREGORY:  Mr. Buck, the issue of the tea party matters, though, because one of the big knocks against you, it's been subject to the campaign between you, is whether or not you took positions to appeal to primary voters, to get that tea party support that you're now backing away from.  This is how The Denver Post editorial wrote about it on Friday.  I'll put it up on the screen. ""Buck ...  ran as a far-right tea party conservative in his primary race against more moderate Jane Norton, and"" now has been tacking--""tracking back to the center."
135,"""It hasn't been an easy waltz.  He'd trip over his feet more often in his march to the center if they weren't in his mouth.  Buck's critics now call his tap dance `Buckpedaling.'"
136,"""First, he said he supports Colorado's `personhood' measure."" An abortion-related measure.  ""Then he backed off.  Now he says he isn't sure. During the primary, he told voters he'd support a Fair Tax.  Then, when faced with a misleading Bennet attack ad, he backed off.  He told one crowd he favored repealing the 17th Amendment, which allows for the direct election of senators, then"" he ""later backpedaled.  His position on Afghanistan has morphed so much it's almost incoherent.  Buck says he doesn't believe in nation-building yet he says we can't leave Afghanistan as a safe haven for terrorists - as if it would be possible to control events there once our troops are gone."" Is that litany?  Is that charge fair?"
137,MR. BUCK:  No.
138,MR. GREGORY:  Explain why.
139,"MR. BUCK:  Well, issues like the 17th Amendment.  As I said, I've been to over 800 events in, in Colorado in, in 20 months.  I have talked about the 17th Amendment.  Someone asked me a question.  I said, `The short answer is yes, but...' and then I gave an explanation of why I thought there were better answers than--to, to restoring the balance of power between the states and the federal government than the 17th Amendment.  Senator Bennet has played a commercial over and over that misstates, misquotes, misleads on, on that issue.  The next day, I called the person back and said, `You know, I, I've thought about it, and I, I don't want to leave you with the impression that the answer is yes.' Fifteen times more, with the Democrat tracker camera in my face, I explained that I wasn't in favor of repealing the 17th Amendment."
140,"It is easy when you have a tracker and, and they have 100 examples of, of answers, and, and the questions are coming at you from different angles, to use tape that shows a slight deviation in the answer.  It is not fair to say that I have backtracked on, on those issues."
141,"MR. GREGORY:  But isn't it also easy to flirt with positions in a primary, and then back off and say, ""Well, I'm not sure I'd actually vote for that,"" you know, once you get into a general election?  Isn't that what people really dislike about politics?"
142,"MR. BUCK:  Well, they, they may dislike it, they--but people are also sick and tired of, of politicians not answering questions, politicians not being accessible.  And I think it's, it's incumbent on us, if we're going to run in this kind of a race--and this is an important year, David.  I think that, you know, this is a different year than most years.  We've got to tell the American people that we have to live with less.  We have a $13.5 trillion debt.  And the only way to do that is an honest campaign with honest people. And, and I have let people know my heart.  It hasn't always been the same exact words to, to the same questions, but it has been--they, they know where I'm coming from on, on issue."
143,MR. GREGORY:  Is he a political opportunist?
144,"SEN. BENNET:  I think absolutely.  I mean, I think it's very clear that he ran a primary election saying that he would privatize Social Security, that he would demolish the Department of Education, that the American people need to wean theirselves off of student loans, that he supported the personhood amendment, pro-life in all cases except for--including cases of rape and incest.  He's not changed his position on that.  And in the general election, even as recently as yesterday, he said, ""Well, I, I don't, I don't support abolishing the Department of Education, but I wouldn't oppose it if it came up for a vote."" That's not the kind of straight talk that people in Colorado want."
145,"And what, what complicates it even further is that the primary election, virtually every dollar spent on TV on behalf of Ken Buck came from groups outside of Colorado, came from groups sponsored by people that got us into this mess in the first place, you know, that managed to drive this economy into the worst ditch since the Great Depression and double our debt.  And in the general election, the same thing is happening.  Eighty-five percent of the money that, that represents the TV ads that are running on behalf of Ken Buck are from outside the state."
146,"But, but the other thing is, in these difficult times, I think it is enormously important.  We're never going to say exactly the same thing every, you know, every second of every day.  But the flip-flops in this race are unbelievable."
147,MR. GREGORY:  I want to--you want to button this up before I move on to some questions.  You say...
148,MR. BUCK:  I would.
149,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
150,"MR. BUCK:  The, the, the media has looked at Senator Pennet--Bennet's ads. The--and in fact, the same editorial that you quoted from talks about the despicable nature of Senator Bennet's ads.  They have been false, misleading, deceitful.  The Colorado Springs paper talked about the fact that the--this was the sleaziest campaign in the history of the state of Colorado.  And on, on Senator Bennet's side, he talks about his deep, deep empathy for Social Security; and he's on the Commission on Aging, he missed 92 percent of the meetings for the Commission on Aging.  He talks about earmark reform.  He voted against earmark reform four times in 2009.  In 2010 he offers a bill, doesn't bother getting one co-sponsor, doesn't bother moving the bill forward in any way, but runs on the fact that he is a good government earmark reformer.  It's, it's that kind of, of, of duplicity that, that Colorado voters are sick of."
151,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me move on.  You can deal with some of that, but I want to move to another issue, which is the role of President Obama in this campaign. He came out to campaign for you, and back in February this is what he said, talking about the economy.  Watch this."
152,"(Videotape, February 18, 2010)"
153,PRES. OBAMA:  He was here by my side in Denver a year ago when we signed the Recovery Act into law.  Wasn't a politically easy decision to make for any of us because we knew that we were already facing big deficits that had been run up over the last decade.  But we had a responsibility to do what was right for the American people and break the back of this recession that was slipping into a depression.
154,(End videotape)
155,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet, on that signature issue, the legacy of that, this is what you said back in September, just last month."
156,"(Videotape, September 11, 2010)"
157,"SEN. BENNET:  We have $13 trillion of debt on our balance sheet and, in my view, nothing to show for it."
158,(End videotape)
159,MR. GREGORY:  So the president said you took the tough vote...
160,SEN. BENNET:  Right.
161,MR. GREGORY:  ...you helped the stimulus get passed.  You say there's nothing to show for it but more debt.  Isn't that an admission...
162,SEN. BENNET:  This...
163,MR. GREGORY:  Hold on.  Isn't that an admission that the major piece to help the economy simply did not work by this administration?
164,"SEN. BENNET:  Absolutely not.  In fact, what I was saying when I say that, which I have said in every town hall meeting in Democratic and Republican parts of the state, is true, because what I say is we have $13 trillion of debt on the balance sheet and nothing to show for it.  I say we have not even had the decency to maintain the assets that our parents and grandparents built for us--our roads, our bridges, our wastewater systems, our sewer systems; by the way, those weren't Bolsheviks, those weren't socialists that built those things for us--much less build the infrastructure we need for the 21st century.  And it's not just transportation.  Transit--listen."
165,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah, but the president acknowledges that, that infrastructure spending has not been really dealt with in this stimulus bill."
166,"SEN. BENNET:  Transit and--transportation, transit and energy infrastructure as well.  That stimulus package saved us from going into the second Great Depression.  But that's hardly enough of a standard if the--if what generations ought to judge other generations is whether they left more opportunity, not less for them.  That's the point that I'm making."
167,"MR. GREGORY:  But what seems to be the issue that's hanging out there is that most Americans don't believe the stimulus has helped.  You have been in lockstep with this president.  Congressional Quarterly says you voted with the president 97 percent of the time.  And in an editorial by The Denver Post, endorsing you, I should point out, this is part of what they say:  ""Michael Bennet for U.S.  Senate.  Since [Bennet] was appointed senator ...  he has been running for election and, at times, running scared.  ..."
168,"""If he had bucked his party and his president on just one major issue, and in turn showed some Colorado independence, it would have been much easier to endorse him.  Instead, his 20-month career has been frustrating to watch, leaving voters, and us, with a difficult choice."
169,"On December of 2009, ""for example, he made an impassioned speech on the Senate floor, blasting Washington lawmakers for their dirty dealing as they patched together a health care bill larded with special deals.  ...  Then, three days later, he voted for the bill."
170,"""The current health care bill is law because of Bennet's one vote.  That vote, and his speech, epitomize his short Senate career:  So much potential, yet not enough spine."""
171,"SEN. BENNET:  Well, let's focus on the potential question.  Listen, I, I did vote--I did cast a vote for health care, and I also said that I thought the process was horrible.  The status quo before we passed health care was also horrible.  And part of what we needed to do was clean up the way Washington does its business, I completely agree with that, because it--it's one of the things that's eroding confidence in the American people and what's going on in, in this town.  I also think that it's clear that the recovery, you know, package has grown the GDP somewhat and saved thousands and thousands of jobs in my home state."
172,"Look, when I agree with the president, I agree with him.  When I disagree with him, I disagree with him.  He's done some things that were not helpful to Colorado, and I've fought back--canceling the Orion Project, making sure that we didn't change the tax treatment for natural gas producers in our state. And I might say, also, that today I was endorsed, not just by The Denver Post, but the Grand Junction Sentinel, who endorsed John McCain and Bob Schaffer, a Republican who ran for this seat."
173,MR. GREGORY:  But on the big ticket items...
174,"SEN. BENNET:  And one of the--let me, let me just say, one of the basis for their endorsement was my willingness to reach across the aisle to work with Republicans and, and my opponent's stated desire to be the chief filibuster of the United States Senate if he gets back here."
175,"MR. GREGORY:  On the big ticket items, the ones that have really contributed to the debt, you were with the president."
176,"SEN. BENNET:  I, I don't disagree.  And the president said, you know, in the clip that you had..."
177,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
178,"SEN. BENNET:  ...that a lot of tough choices were going to have to be made here.  And it's true, the choices are tough.  And the politics right now are not supporting the aspirations we have for our kids and our grandkids. They're not allowing us to make--or they haven't allowed us to make even tougher choices that we're still going to have to make going forward."
179,MR. GREGORY:  Why is that unreasonable in your view?
180,"MR. BUCK:  I'll tell you, Senator Bennet does one thing in Washington, D.C., and then comes back to Colorado and talks about a completely different thing. He has spent--on his watch in Washington, D.C., been part of the spending of $3 trillion.  That's $3 trillion.  We can talk about $13 trillion on the book; $3 trillion dollars has been accumulated since he's been in D.C., and that's something that he has to take responsibility for."
181,"MR. GREGORY:  And you take responsibility, as well, for what Republicans did in terms of running up the debt before that?"
182,"MR. BUCK:  David, I have said over and over that Republicans are every bit as much to blame as Democrats, and I am not going to be one of those Republicans when I get to Washington."
183,MR. GREGORY:  So to that...
184,"SEN. BENNET:  Well, just to be clear on that point, though, the, the budget, the budget proposals that he's made would blow, without even talking about the tax cut extensions, $1.3 trillion more of a hole into our budget than we already have and, and, depending on what we do with these extensions, an additional $4 trillion of debt on the balance sheet."
185,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let me ask you on that point, do you agree with Republican leaders who say that tax cuts do not have to be paid for?"
186,"MR. BUCK:  No, I don't.  I, I think we've got to find spending cuts.  And I don't know what you're talking about in terms of tax cuts."
187,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, extanding--extending the Bush-era tax cuts for the highest earners.  The president says it all the time, it would cost an extra $700 billion.  Should those be paid for if the--if, if Republicans like you want to cut that deficit, bring it in balance, do you then have to pay for the tax cuts you want to extend?"
188,"MR. BUCK:  Well, first, David, where are the families going to pay for the money that they've got to send the federal government?  That's, that's the bigger question to me.  Secondly, though..."
189,"MR. GREGORY:  But how can that be bigger?  You either believe in the balanced budget or you do not.  If you extend tax cuts, you said just a moment ago they have to be paid for.  Then how do you pay for it?"
190,"MR. BUCK:  Well, the, the--we pay for it by cutting spending.  We also pay for it by growing government.  When we leave money in the hands of taxpayers, they buy things, they pay taxes, they grow government.  It's not a one for one exchange in the first year, but, but it would be bad, in my view--and, and I--every economist I've talked to has told me that it would be bad in a recession to try to increase taxes."
191,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, and you think there should be an extension on all the tax cuts for at least a year."
192,"SEN. BENNET:  For a year.  For a year.  In part to figure out how we do pay for it.  I mean, the same thing that Ken is saying right now is what the Bush administration said when it created these tax cuts to begin with, and what we saw was the first period of economic growth in our country's history when middle-class income fell."
193,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
194,SEN. BENNET:  Our middle-class...
195,"MR. GREGORY:  But not--it's not fair to compare him to all Republicans. Republican leaders don't agree with what he just said, which is that you have to pay for tax cuts.  So isn't he--aren't you guys more in line, wouldn't you say?"
196,"SEN. BENNET:  Well, I didn't--I actually didn't hear him say that.  I heard him say that you pay for it, and also by growing government you pay for it. I'm not quite sure what that means.  But..."
197,"MR. BUCK:  Well, let me explain to you.  Here..."
198,"SEN. BENNET:  ...my point is, my point is..."
199,"MR. BUCK:  ...you grow government because as people have more money they spend the money and government grows.  When we put people back to work, the government grows, we increase revenue and we decrease unemployment benefits."
200,"SEN. BENNET:  Well I'm definitely not interested in growing government, I can tell you that."
201,"MR. BUCK:  I'm sorry, growing the economy.  I apologize."
202,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
203,MR. BUCK:  Growing the economy.
204,MR. GREGORY:  You're talking about growing the economy.
205,MR. BUCK:  Right.
206,MR. GREGORY:  Is there also a reality that how do you pay for an extension of middle-class tax cuts?
207,"SEN. BENNET:  Yeah.  I think there's a reality to all of it.  I mean, the, the, the top 2 percent is $700 billion.  All of them together are, are $4 trillion.  And we're going to have to make some very hard choices to make sure that our kids are not bearing a debt that we were unwilling to deal with."
208,"MR. GREGORY:  Mr. Buck, I want to ask you about women who are taking a hard look at this race and deciding how they're going to make up their minds, and some issues that have come up, controversial issues, for you.  You've taken a hard line position on abortion, saying you'd vote for a ban even if it includes rape and incest.  During the primary campaign, you said, you said that voters should vote for you because you don't wear high heels.  And then there was an issue that's gotten a lot of attention, as a district attorney, about a 2006 date rape case.  You declined to prosecute.  You told the Greeley Tribune, ""A jury could very well conclude that this was a case of buyer's remorse,"" after you looked at the circumstances of the case and decided not to prosecute.  A lot of people thought that was an insensitive remark.  The woman who was involved in this case has been critical of you, saying that your tone was one of, in essence, attacking her.  It was not the first time that your judgment or your ethics as a lawyer has been questioned.  And I wonder whether you regret using those words, and whether you think women should give some weight to those issues in deciding whether to vote for you."
209,"MR. BUCK:  I, I, I think women as well as men are concerned about jobs and the economy and spending and, and other issues.  They're concerned that when their kids graduate from college they have an economy and they have a future in this country and they, they have the same opportunity that we've had and our grandparents have had.  But I'd like to talk about a couple of those issues, if I can..."
210,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
211,MR. BUCK:  ...to clarify some things.
212,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
213,"MR. BUCK:  Rape case came into our office, it was reviewed by an attorney with--a prosecutor with 30 years prosecutorial experience who's now on the Colorado Court of Appeals.  He declined to prosecute.  Two female chief deputies reviewed the case, talked to witnesses, they, they declined to prosecute.  The case went to another chief deputy who had handled many of the high-profile rape cases in the, in the Denver metro area.  He declined to prosecute.  I met with this young lady, explained the circumstances.  I then sent the case to the Boulder County district attorney's office for, for Boulder County because they had a lot of experience with date rape as a result of the University of Colorado being in that county.  They declined to prosecute and told me that the case couldn't be prosecuted.  It was after this--the young lady made this case public that I had to explain to the newspaper exactly what..."
214,MR. GREGORY:  But do you regret the way you either talked to her or talked about the case?
215,"MR. BUCK:  I don't regret the way I talked to her.  I think, I think the--it is important that a prosecutor approach a victim with, with a certain amount of reality, and that's what I tried to do with this victim.  I didn't blame her at all."
216,MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But what about what you told the Greeley Tribune?
217,"MR. BUCK:  What I told the Greeley Tribune, I gave them five or six reasons why I thought a jury could decline this case."
218,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
219,"MR. BUCK:  One of the reasons was the fact that she had regretted this relationship, and she had buyer's remorse as a result of the relationship that she had with this young man."
220,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
221,"MR. BUCK:  That is, that is something that I think when, when someone decides to make a case public, the public has to understand why."
222,"MR. GREGORY:  Senator, is this an issue?"
223,"SEN. BENNET:  I just--I, I do think it's an issue.  Look, I have a lot of sympathy for the victim in this case.  He just used the language again, buyer's remorse, and is the father of three little girls.  I just think that's the wrong way to talk about this kind of set of circumstances, especially when you're a prosecutor."
224,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we're going to leave it..."
225,SEN. BENNET:  I...
226,"MR. GREGORY:  ...we're going to leave it there.  We're going to come back. We want to get to some other issues.  We're going to take a quick break.  More from our Colorado's candidates for the U.S.  Senate when our special debate series continues, right after this brief station break."
227,                               (Announcements)
228,MR. GREGORY:  We are back to continue our special Senate debate series with the candidates locked in a tight race for the Colorado Senate seat.
229,I want to do a bit of a lightning round here.  I want to get to some issues here and have shorter answers on these things.
230,"And Mr. Buck I want to start with you.  The issue of gays in our country, in a debate last month you expressed your support for ""don't ask, don't tell,"" which we talked about with Mr. Gibbs, and you alluded to lifestyle choices. Do you believe that being gay is a choice?"
231,MR. BUCK:  I do.
232,MR. GREGORY:  Based on what?
233,MR. BUCK:  Based on what?
234,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
235,MR. BUCK:  Well...
236,MR. GREGORY:  Why do you believe that?
237,"MR. BUCK:  Well, I guess you can, you can choose who your partner is."
238,MR. GREGORY:  You don't think it's something that's determined at birth?
239,"MR. BUCK:  I, I, I think that birth has an influence over like alcoholism and some other things, but I think that basically you, you have a choice."
240,MR. GREGORY:  Does that put him outside the mainstream of views on this?
241,SEN. BENNET:  I absolutely believe he's outside the mainstream of views on this.
242,"MR. GREGORY:  About Afghanistan, for you, Mr. Bennet.  If President Obama and General Petraeus were to determine that they need a significant number of troops to stay in Afghanistan beyond the July 2011 deadline, is that a position that you'd be able to support?"
243,"SEN. BENNET:  My position is that we ought to begin bringing our troops home in July '11.  And there will be troops there, they'll have to leave troops there, and I recognize that.  But this is the longest shooting war in our country's history."
244,"MR. GREGORY:  But if a significant number of combat forces must remain to achieve U.S.  goals, you'd be for it or against it?"
245,"SEN. BENNET:  I would have to look at it then, but what I want to make clear is that I believe the president needs to honor the commitment that he made to begin bringing our troops home.  I don't know what significant is.  I imagine that there will be a substantial number of troops there for the foreseeable future."
246,MR. GREGORY:  And you could support that?
247,"SEN. BENNET:  But I, but I believe what the American people need to see that our commitment there is coming to an end."
248,"MR. GREGORY:  How do you answer that, Mr. Buck?"
249,"MR. BUCK:  Well, I, I don't think we set artificial deadlines.  I think that we, we set realistic goals, and, and we try to accomplish those goals.  I don't think we should be nation-building, I don't think we should be staying there over the long-term.  I..."
250,"MR. GREGORY:  What if General Petraeus says, ""You know what, it's July 2011, but if we're going to achieve our goals, we can't pull any troops out.  May need more troops, may need to surge up again here."" Well, you could support that because you don't believe in deadlines?"
251,"MR. BUCK:  No, I didn't say I could support that.  I don't believe in deadlines, I don't believe in telling the enemy when we're going to withdraw. I need to know what he thinks the goals are.  And if I agree with those goals, then evaluate at that point."
252,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you a question about the Supreme Court.  Obviously a crucial role as a U.S.  senator, confirming a justice who's nominated by the president.  Which sitting justices would you have voted against?"
253,"MR. BUCK:  I would have voted against Justice Sotomayor, and I would have voted against Justice Kagan, for two."
254,"MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.  Are there Clinton-era nominees as well, down the line?"
255,"MR. BUCK:  Perhaps.  I didn't, obviously, study them as much as I have the last two."
256,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.  For you?
257,"SEN. BENNET:  I probably would have voted against Justice Thomas, and, and, and I've been disappointed by what Justice Roberts has done.  I think--my own view is that the president has a constitutional prerogative to nominate people, and if they're qualified, they ought to be confirmed, even if I disagree with their positions on a lot of things.  I think one of the most graceful moments over the last 20 months, since I've been in this job in the Senate, was Lindsey Graham's statement before he cast his vote for Elena Kagan that set out the president's constitutional prerogatives and his constitutional obligations as a United States senator.  I thought it was a class act what Lindsey Graham said, and I wish we saw more of that in the United States Senate."
258,"MR. GREGORY:  Mr. Buck, this is kind of related to something you told The Washington Post back in July, and I want to put it up on the screen.  ""There's a conservative movement within the Republican Party that distinguishes a lot of us, and we recognize that Republicans are a big part of the problem.  ... I don't have any deep friends in Washington now, and in six years I won't have any friends."" Is that..."
259,"MR. BUCK:  Other than you, David.  Other than you."
260,SEN. BENNET:  I'll be you...
261,MR. GREGORY:  But is that part of the problem?
262,"MR. BUCK:  Yeah.  But you won't be in Washington, that's the problem."
263,"MR. GREGORY:  But is that part of the problem, that you want to come to Washington and not have any friends?  How do you solve problems if you can't work with people on the other side?"
264,"MR. BUCK:  Yeah.  And, again, I think if you take that literally, you, you reach that conclusion.  What I was saying there is I'm not coming to Washington, D.C., to make friends.  I'm coming to Washington, D.C., to do the people's work.  And the people's work has to do with reducing spending and cutting budgets and, and trying to get a grip on the size of government. Will, will I meet people here?  Will I develop friendships?  Sure.  But I am not going to let those friendships interfere with my obligation to do the people's work."
265,"MR. GREGORY:  Who, who's a Republican--you've talked about working with both sides--who's a Republican you admire?  You talked about Lindsey Graham."
266,"SEN. BENNET:  I just mentioned Lindsey Graham.  I, I wrote a bill--I wasn't here for the bailouts.  Ken doesn't know that, but I wasn't here for the bailouts.  I was here to write a bill called the Pay It Back Act that said that the money that came back from the TARP-recipient banks should be used dollar for dollar for deficit reduction.  Bob Corker was an original co-sponsor on that bill."
267,MR. GREGORY:  Senator from Tennessee.
268,"SEN. BENNET:  Johnny Isakson from Georgia, a Republican as well, helped with that bill.  It passed with broad bipartisan support."
269,MR. GREGORY:  (Unintelligible)
270,SEN. BENNET:  That's what people in my town hall meetings want.  They're sick of the hyper-partisanship.  They don't want to send somebody back to D.C. that says I'm going to be the chief filibuster or I'm going to put my track shoes on...
271,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
272,SEN. BENNET:  ...because I'm going to filibuster so much.  She--he should save his time.  There are people back here that will do that.
273,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We've got about...
274,SEN. BENNET:  What we need is cooperation.
275,"MR. GREGORY:  I've got about a minute left, I want you both to take this. This is from Facebook.  We partnered up with Facebook's politics page, and we've solicited some questions for you on the page, and here's one that we chose.  Ashley Newberg:  ""This is what I would ask them:  What do you hope to accomplish, both in your political career and in life in general (outside of politics?"" But you've got to be very brief.  Mr. Buck:"
276,"MR. BUCK:  In my political career, I'd like to see a constitutional balanced budget amendment."
277,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
278,"MR. BUCK:  And in my life, I'd like to play more golf and, and get a decent handicap."
279,MR. GREGORY:  There you go.
280,"SEN. BENNET:  I--this isn't a hard question for me because I've spent my whole life outside of politics.  This is my first exposure to it.  I hope to be able to accomplish a set of policies that make--create more opportunity, not less, for our kids and our grandkids.  Outside of politics, I hope to raise my three little girls to be productive and happy citizens."
281,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We're going to leave it there.  Thank you both.
282,"Early voting starting in Colorado, and Monday night, Bill Clinton, the former president, campaigning for you and for the Democrats out there.  Strikingly, he seems to be one or the more respected political figures on both sides in Colorado right now.  So a hard-fought contest, and we'll, we'll be watching."
283,And we will be right back.
284,SEN. BENNET:  Thank you.
285,(Announcements)
286,"MR. GREGORY:  That is all for today.  We'll be back next week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

MR. DAVID GREGORY:
This Sunday, nine days left before 
Election Day
2010
. The 
final countdown
 and the final arguments. Will it be a 
GOP
 wave or more of a 
split decision
? Both sides are fired up and fighting 
hard to get
 their voters to the polls.
"

MR. GREGORY:
Can a Republican send Majority Leader 
Harry Reid
 back home and remove 
Democrats
 from 
power
 in the 
House
? And how will their embrace of the 
tea party
 play out on 
Election Day
 and beyond? With us exclusively this morning, the man at the 
center
 of it all, the leader of the 
Republican Party
, Chairman 
Michael Steele
. Plus, we'll look at the latest polls. Who's up, who's down and who's pulling out all the stops? As the president spends the week trying to rally the Democratic base 
out West
, the right 
declares war
 on 
National Public Radio
 after the abrupt firing of news analyst and commentator 
Juan Williams
. We'll look at it all with
"

our expanded roundtable:

David Brooks
 of 
The New York Times
, 
E.J. Dionne
 of 
The Washington Post

NBC News

MEET THE PRESS

"

MR. GREGORY:
And good morning. Well, here we are. The 
final countdown
 to 
election day
2010
. With us exclusively this morning, the chairman of the 
Republican National Committee
, 
Michael Steele
. Welcome back to 
MEET THE PRESS
.
"
13,"
MR. STEELE:
It's great to be back with you, 
David
.
"
14,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let's get right to it. It's final argument time and the president is on the 
campaign
 trail. He's been 
out West
, he was in the 
Midwest
. And on Friday he leveled probably his most potent charge against Republican leaders in 
Washington
, saying that they made a cold 
political
 calculation when he came into office, basically not to work with the 
Obama White House
, that they could've cooperated, decided to obstruct. This is part of what he said.
"
15,"

"
16,"
PRES. OBAMA:

The Republican
 leaders in 
Washington
, they made a different calculation. They, they looked around at the mess that they had made, at the mess that they had left me, and they said, ""Boy, this is a really big mess."" And they said, ""It's going to take a long time to fix, so maybe if we just sit on the sidelines, say no to everything, and then point our fingers at 
Obama
 and say he's to blame,"" they figure that maybe y'all would forget that they caused the mess 
in the first place
, and they'd be able to ride anger all the way to 
election
 time.
"
17,"

"
18,"
MR. GREGORY:
Chairman, what's your answer to that, your vision of what the story of the last two years has been?
"
19,"
MR. STEELE:
Well, it actually sounded more like a pity 
party
 than a rally. I mean, I can't believe the president's sitting there with, with hindsight saying that we didn't cooperate, that Republican leaders did not cooperate with the president. I think from 
health care
 to the environment to the 
economy
, 
Republicans
 in the 
House
 and the 
Senate
 had made, made very clear, ""This is what we'd like to do, let's talk about 
healthcare reform
 that includes 
tort reform
, that includes other types of mechanisms that will keep sacrosanct the doctor-patient relationship and not put 
government
 in the middle of that. 
Let's talk
 about 
job creation
 by stimulating small businesses and not the 
federal government
."" And so the ideas that were put on the table, a lot of them propounded by folks like Mr. 
Boehner
 and 
Eric Cantor
 and, and 
Paul Ryan
 were summarily rejected. In fact, as you recall, 
David
, Republican leaders, particularly specific members, couldn't even get a meeting with the president. They tried, after sending letters and requests, to sit down and go through the president's 
agenda
 to see how we could help. We're hoping for a better relationship between the 
White House
 and the 
Republican Congress
 come January.
"
20,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, let me ask you about the landscape right now. What do you see out there? What are we looking at on 
Election Day
? Is this a huge 
GOP
 wave that takes the 
House
 and the 
Senate
? What are your views at this point?
"
21,"
MR. STEELE:

David
, there is, there is a vibration out here that is unlike anything I've ever seen before. I've been on my ""Fire Pelosi"" bus since 
September 15th
. We get off the bus on 
October 30th
, and in that time, what I've seen is a consistent groundswell of, of excitement and energy towards this 
election
. The voters are tired of the fact that the 
federal government
 has not listened to them over the past two years, has moved in its own 
direction
 at its own rhythm, and they want to pull back on that. 
And I
 think you're going to see a wave, an unprecedented wave, on 
Election Day
 that's going to surprise a lot of people.
"
22,"
MR. GREGORY:
What does that mean?
"
23,"
MR. STEELE:
And now -- both the 
House
 and the 
Senate
...
"
24,"
MR. GREGORY:
What does that mean in terms of the balance of 
power
?
"
25,"
MR. STEELE:
...and 
state legislatures
.
"
26,"
MR. GREGORY:
What does it mean to the balance of 
power
?
"
27,"
MR. STEELE:
Well, I think the -- oh, I absolutely believe in the 
House
 the balance of 
power
 will shift, as I like to say, with 38 seats, and we need to get to 39 to, to, to get 
control
, but I think we're more than there.
"
28,"
MR. GREGORY:
You say the 
House
 will go to the 
Republicans
. What about the 
Senate
?
"
29,"
MR. STEELE:

The Senate
's a 
little
 bit tougher, but I think we're going to be there. If this wave continues the way it's going, it has been over the last few weeks, especially, I think you could see the 
Senate
, as well, go to the 
Republicans
.
"
30,"
MR. GREGORY:
There's been, there's been a lot of negative attention towards some 
tea party
- backed candidates in some of the statements that they've made, whether it's 
Sharron Angle
 speaking to a group of 
Latinos
 in 
Nevada
, or 
Ken Buck
's statements about gays on this program last week, or 
Christine O'Donnell
...
"
31,"
MR. STEELE:
Mm-hmm.
"
32,"
MR. GREGORY:
...who's gotten so much attention, except for the fact that she's very 
far behind
 in that 
Senate
 race, she's had some both misstatements or gaffs in the course of her 
debate
 with 
Chris Coons
.
"
33,"
MR. STEELE:
Sure.
"
34,"
MR. GREGORY:
Do you think she's actually undermining the Republican brand, specifically?
"
35,"
MR. STEELE:
No, I don't. I mean, 
Chris
, you know, folks make mistakes. Lord knows I'm familiar with, you know, 
foot in mouth disease
. I understand how that is sometimes when you get in the heat of a battle, you've got the passion and the fire in your belly, and you really want to get out there and, and speak to the issues and speak to the people, you say things that don't come out correctly. You make missteps, you make -- you create misperceptions. 
And I
 think that happens a lot in campaigns. It happens on both sides. What really matters is how the voters receive that, how the voters look at those candidates. And despite those, those foibles and those flaws, if you will, of, of the misspoken word, people understand where their heart is. People understand these folks are going to go out there and 
fight
 for them. And, as I said a 
little
 bit earlier, 
David
, this, this, this reality right now for people is, is that we want a leadership that's going to listen to us. We want someone who's going to take the 
fight
 to 
Congress
 and not 
fight
 against us. And, you know, whether it's 
Christine O'Donnell
 or 
Sharron Angle
, whomever it happens to be, who's got this groundswell of energy behind them, I think that that's what really matters to the people right now.
"
36,"
MR. GREGORY:
Is she qualified to be a 
U.S. senator
? Would she be a good senator?
"
37,"
MR. STEELE:
I think she would be. You know, again, I don't get to make that judgment. The people in her 
state
 get to make that judgment. They're the ones who vote for her. They're the ones who nominated her. And so, for the 
establishment
 in 
Washington
 or anywhere else to sit back and sit in judgment of her abilities to be a senator, to be effective in the 
Senate
 is misplaced. What -- all that matters is the people have decided, ""This is, this is the standard-bearer we want."" And the, and the real push and the 
fight
 now is the 
general election
. And the, and the broader population of voters in the 
state of Delaware
, 
California
, 
Florida
, around the 
country
 are going to make the decision about the Republican standard-bearers that we have.
"
38,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me ask you, Chairman...
"
39,"
MR. STEELE:

And I
 think 
at the end of the day
 we're going to do very well.
"
40,"
MR. GREGORY:
Chairman, let me ask you about the role of 
outside money
 in this 
campaign
. It is a big area of 
debate
.
"
41,"
MR. STEELE:
Sure.
"
42,"
MR. GREGORY:
And the Speaker, 
Nancy Pelosi
, appeared on 
MSNBC
's ""
Countdown with Keith Olbermann
"" this week, and she, like the president, described it as a real threat to the 
country
's democracy. This is a part of what she had to say.
"
43,"

"
44,"
SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI:
This 
election
 is also about our democracy.
"
45,"
MR. KEITH OLBERMANN:
Mm-hmm.
"
46,"
SPEAKER PELOSI:
If they win, which I fully intend to stop them from doing, but if they were to win, it would mean that we are now a plutocracy and an oligarchy, whatever these few wealthy, secret, unlimited sources of 
money
 are can 
control
 our entire 
agenda
.
"
47,"

"

MR. GREGORY:
Our investigative correspondent, 
Mike Skiff
, has said that ""Not since 
Watergate
 have we seen this kind of 
special interest
money
 without 
transparency
 washing into an 
election
cycle
."" Are you worried about this?
"
49,"
MR. STEELE:
No. I don't know what they're talking about. No one's produced one shred of evidence that any of that is happening. And, you know, I -- look, you know, when President, then candidate, 
Obama
 was asked to disclose some of his donors because there was suspicion of their being, you know, the foreign source of 
money
 into his 
campaign
, they refused to do it. So don't give me this high and mighty, you know, holier than thou attitude about, about 
special interests
 flooding, flooding the 
political
 marketplace. 
The Democrats
 have been dabbling in those areas and clearly disclose it. If you, if you think that there's something out there, disclose it, 
Nancy
. Disclose it, you know, anyone else who's got that evidence. Don't just make the charge and sit back and say, ""Oh gee, see."" Give, give the evidence. Put the evidence out there and then let's have that discussion about whether or not they are, in fact, foreign...
"
50,"
MR. GREGORY:
But, Chairman, are you denying, are you denying that there is 
special interest
money
, that there's 
outside money
 that's coming into the 
campaign
 that is not being disclosed?
"
51,"
MR. STEELE:
I...
"
52,"
MR. GREGORY:
We don't know who the individuals are in these, some of these groups that are sponsored?
"
53,"
MR. STEELE:
I -- 
Dave
, how would, how would I, how, how would I know that? I don't run those organizations, 
number
 one. I'm prohibited by law from engaging such -- in such activity, 
number
 two. So I know we don't take it, and I suspect that those organizations out there, those 527s and others know what the law is and are complying with the law. So if you have evidence to the contrary, produce it. Otherwise, 
put up or shut up
.
"
54,"
MR. GREGORY:
OK, but...
"
55,"
MR. STEELE:
It's just that -- that's it. 
Put up or shut up
.
"
56,"
MR. GREGORY:
Chairman, I, I'm putting up with this question, which is are you concerned that because, as you know, there are laws that you do not have to disclose. That's the question. Is that a 
problem
 in our politics...
"
57,"
MR. STEELE:
Right.
"
58,"
MR. GREGORY:
...when you can put a great deal of 
money
 into a 
campaign
 without disclosing your 
agenda
 or who you are?
"
59,"
MR. STEELE:
Well, OK, 
David
, that's a fair question. Well, that's a fair question.
"
60,"
MR. GREGORY:
You said 
put up or shut up
, that's the issue.
"
61,"
MR. STEELE:
Then the 
Congress
 needs to -- then, then the, then, then the put up part by the 
Congress
 would be to change the law. But the law is what it is right now, and everybody's compliant with the law. And if the law does not require disclosure of certain individuals or information, then...
"
62,"
MR. GREGORY:
I'm asking you, is that a 
problem
?
"
63,"
MR. STEELE:
I don't, I don't know that it is so far. I mean, I haven't seen any evidence that it is. Why, why are you saying it's a 
problem
?
"
64,"
MR. GREGORY:
I'm asking whether you think -- there are certainly candidates running who are 
Republicans
 who think there ought to be more 
transparency
. 
Ken Buck
 from 
Colorado
 thinks that you should definitely say where the 
money
 comes from if you're getting it in a 
campaign
.
"
65,"
MR. STEELE:
Absolute -- I -- 
David
, absolutely. I'm always -- I'm -- 
at the end of the day
, I agree with -- I am absolutely all for 
transparency
. It's -- I think it's an appropriate part of the system. It instills the trust that people have in the system, and it also avoids questions like this because that, that information is out there. And it's absolutely will avoid the, the allegations and the charges just thrown out there in the middle of a, of a, of a, of a discussion about 
health care
 and the 
economy
.
"
66,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. Let...
"
67,"
MR. STEELE:
So I agree, the 
transparency
 should be there. But the law is what the law is right now. And if people are that bothered by it, then the 
Congress
 needs to change it.
"
68,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let me ask you about another 
hot button issue
 this week, the firing of 
Juan Williams
, the analyst at 
NPR
 and 
Fox News Channel
. It has become a point of 
debate
 in, in the course of the 
campaign
.
"
69,"
MR. STEELE:
Yeah.
"
70,"
MR. GREGORY:

Eric Cantor
, the Republican whip, issued a statement on Friday saying the
"
71,"
following:
""Over-reaching 
political correctness
 is chipping away at the fundamental American freedoms of speech and expression. 
NPR
's decision to fire 
Williams
 not only undermines that, it shows an ignorance of the fact that 
radical Islam
 and the terrorists who murder in its name scare people of all faiths, religions, and beliefs. In light of their rash decision, we will include termination of 
federal funding
 for 
NPR
 as an option in the 
YouCut
 program so that 
Americans
 can 
let it be known
 whether they want their dollars going to that organization."" Is this a legitimate part of the 
campaign
?
"
72,"
MR. STEELE:
I don't know if it's a legitimate part of the 
campaign
. I think what 
NPR
 did was overreaching. I think it was a hyperextended overreaction to his comments. He was expressing a personal perspective, he wasn't giving a 
political analysis
. He wasn't, he wasn't being a pundit about the matter. He was expressing his own personal concerns that he had. I think that the more appropriate thing would have been to, as we've seen in other cases when, you know, a 
Tina Noten
, for instance, made outlandish comments about, you know, 
Strom Thurmond
 or others getting 
AIDS
 and, and all of this stuff. You take them aside, just sit them down and go, ""Wait a minute, that's a line you don't, you don't need to cross."" I think, you know, immediately jumping to firing 
Juan
 over this was a, was a overreaction. 
And I
 think you've seen the reaction, not just by 
Republicans
, but by a whole lot of folks out there around the 
country
, as they, you know, ""Really?"" The -- this is, this is not the appropriate way to, to really handle this. 
And I
 think that, you know, 
NPR
 is paying a 
little
 bit of a price for it.
"
73,"
MR. GREGORY:
Should, should 
federal funding
 for 
NPR
 be cut?
"
74,"
MR. STEELE:
That's not my decision. I'm sure the members of the 
Congress
 who, who've raised that as a concern will, will address that at the appropriate time. But I think right now my focus and the focus of those of us who are on the 
political
 side of this equation are much more interested in getting to the 
elections
 on 
November 2
 so we can win and put in place a new 
Congress
 to look at questions like that.
"
75,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, let's end with just a couple of points about politics. What does the midterm result, in your mind, say about 
2012
?
"
76,"
MR. STEELE:
Ah, good question. I think, I think it's a transitional pattern. I think, you know, puts us all at a point where, you know, you kind of look down the road to 
2012
 and say what -- for the 
Republicans
, what kind of leader is going to emerge to deal more precisely with the 
economy
, with our relations overseas, with, you know, those concerns that people have about jobs here in the 
country
? I think it may be a harbinger of a very exciting, you know, 
campaign
 in '12. Particularly if we do not take the 
Senate
 this time, the 
Senate
 would, would be in full play in 
2012
. You would still have the addition of additional 
House
 seats that would be out there, as well as some 
state legislative
races
 so -- and 
governors
races
. So I think this 
election
cycle
 in 
2010
 really lays an interesting foundation for how we go forward. Because you -- you're looking at two very different philosophical views of the 
country
.
"
77,"
MR. GREGORY:
Do you, do you think that 
President Obama
's a one-term president?
"
78,"
MR. STEELE:
I don't know that. Again, you know, my job is to make sure he is, but, you know, because I -- we philosophically disagree with the 
direction
 the president is going. 
And I
 think that, you know, the spending, the debt, the deficit, the burden that's been placed on the backs of future generations is unsustainable. And, and, you know, we've seen that the 
administration
, along with 
Nancy Pelosi
 and 
Harry Reid
, are kind of whistling past that graveyard, ignoring the hard facts that we cannot sustain nor afford the continued spending policies of this 
administration
. And there are other concerns out there as well with respect to, again, our relation with -- relationships with 
Israel
, our, our relationships with 
North Korea
. All of these concerns need to be addressed, and I think have pretty much not been, effectively, by the 
administration
. So you're going to see over the next two years, I think, the president try to, you know, step up his game a 
little
 bit. But we'll be there step for step on all of these issues, clearly delineating the difference between a 
government
 that wants to take and redistribute wealth, and a 
free people
 who are there to create that wealth and save it for the future.
"
79,"
MR. GREGORY:
And finally, Chairman, let me ask you about your own leadership. You say that you will be judged on...
"
80,"
MR. STEELE:
Mm-hmm.
"
81,"
MR. GREGORY:
...whether the 
party
 wins this fall and whether you can 
raise money
. Well, the hard truth is that the 
RNC
 has really fallen down in terms of raising 
money
. The committee is in debt, you've been really outraised by the 
Democrats
, and yet this is such a positive environment for 
Republicans
. And the criticism has been harsh. It's been summed up by 
Fred Barnes
 in a op-ed piece in 
The Wall Street Journal
.
"
82,"
MR. STEELE:
Yeah.
"
83,"
MR. GREGORY:
Here's a portion of what he said: ""Mr. 
Steele
 and the irrelevant 
RNC
. Many congressional 
Republicans
 and 
governors
 no longer trust Mr. 
Steele
 as their spokesman. They tend to work around the 
RNC
 rather than engage Mr. 
Steele
."" Are you irrelevant?
"
84,"
MR. STEELE:
No, I'm not irrelevant. And, and 
God bless
Fred Barnes
. If he'd only called me and talked to me, I would have shared with him some very interesting information. It's easy to write that without knowledge, and clearly he is without knowledge here because 
the fact of the matter
 is, 
number
 one, yeah, we have been outraised in recently, recently by the 
Democrats
 because they have the 
White House
, the 
Congress
, and the 
Senate
. We don't. But yet, in 
2009
 we, we outraised the 
Democrats
 in like seven out of 11 months where we took in more than they did. We're keeping pace with the 
Democrats
 right now. But the bottom line is this, and I, and I really appreciate the question because I said from the very beginning, I would be a different kind of chairman because this is a different time for us, for our 
party
. I wanted us to play on all 
50 states
. I wanted us to be out in the communities. I wanted a grassroots, bottom-up 
party
 that was focused on what the people want out there. And so we've put in place around this 
country
 a network now that you're going to see unleashed on 
November 2
...
"
85,"
MR. GREGORY:
So, so you'll run for re-
election
?
"
86,"
MR. STEELE:
...that's going to contribute to the win. So -- I don't know if -- we'll worry about my re-
election
 after I get through this re-
election
. But let me just share with you this point, that we have smashed the records in fundraising for, for a 
party
 out of 
power
, not having those, those 
White House
, 
Congress
 and 
Senate
. We have raised to date over $175 million in this 
cycle
, which is 34 percent more than the 
Democrats
 did in a very similar 
cycle
 in 
2006
. And, and, and furthermore, we have also, just to be clear about this, exceeded the amount that was raised by the D -- by the 
RNC
 in 
1994
 in, in, in today's dollars. So we have kept pace. And we have 360 victory centers around the 
country
. We have made 35 
million
 voter contacts since January this year because of the work that the 
RNC
 has done early. We spent the 
money
 early, we didn't stockpile the 
money
, 
David
, as the old 
RNCs
 would do...
"
87,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right.
"
88,"
MR. STEELE:
...so that they could have a good cash on hand at the end of the month. We wanted the 
money
 in the 
states
. That's where it is. And come 
November 2
 you're going to see the effect of that planning.
"
89,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, Chairman 
Steele
, we will leave it there. 
Thank you very much
, as always.
"
90,"
MR. STEELE:
You got it, friend. Take care.
"
91,"
MR. GREGORY:
And up next, a look at all the very latest polls and all the big 
races
, the 
2010
 landscape as we head into the final week of campaigning. Can 
Democrats
 turn out their voters? What role will the 
tea party
 play? Our roundtable puts it all into perspective: 
David Brooks
 of 
The New York Times
, 
E.J. Dionne
 of 
The Washington Post
, former Democratic Congressman 
Harold Ford Jr
., 
MSNBC
's 
Rachel Maddow
, and 
CNBC
's 
Rick Santelli
.
"
92,"

"
93,"
MR. GREGORY:
Coming up, will 
Election Day
2010
 bring a 
GOP
 wave to 
Washington
? Our roundtable breaks down the biggest 
races
 across the 
country
 and the keys to the final stretch of the 
campaign
, after this brief 
commercial break
.
"
94,"

"
95,"
MR. GREGORY:
We are back, and we want to go through some of the latest polls that are out just this week in some of the most high-profile 
Senate
races
, and I want to start with seats currently held by 
Democrats
. In 
California
, this is breaking information coming from the 
LA Times
, longtime senator 
Barbara Boxer
, she's now at 50 percent in this new 
LA Times
 poll over the Republican challenger, 
Carly Fiorina
, at 42 percent. It looked like it was a race that was tightening. 
Boxer
 at 50 percent, that's a 
big deal
. And in 
Colorado
, a new poll out also this morning from 
The Denver Post
. You saw them 
debate
 right here last Sunday, the race between Democratic Senator 
Michael Bennet
, Republican 
Ken Buck
. It is now a 
dead heat
, 47-47. The 
open seat
 in 
Connecticut
, 
Chris Dodd
 retiring there. An example here of 
Democrats
coming home
 a bit, 
state attorney general
Dick Blumenthal
 leading in the polls against former 
World Wrestling Entertainment
 CEO Republican 
Linda McMahon
. He's up at 57 percent over 39 percent, a widening spread there. 
President Obama
's 
Senate
 seat in 
Illinois
, the candidates both debated here. Well, that race between Republican Congressman 
Mark Kirk
 and the Democrat 
Alexi Giannoulias
, a poll out this week, 43 percent for 
Mark Kirk
. He's got a slight edge over 
Giannoulias
. The president certainly a benefactor in that race. The 
open seat
 in 
Pennsylvania
, where Democratic Congressman 
Joe Sestak
 has managed to surprise a lot of observers, tightened this race against the Republican former Congressman 
Pat Toomey
. Two new polls. One has 
Sestak
 with an edge, 44-41. On the left here shows 
Toomey
 with an edge at 48, 46 percent. All eyes on 
Philadelphia
 and turnout there. That's going to matter. To 
Wisconsin
, three-term Democratic Senator 
Russ Feingold
, in an unexpectedly tough race and ride, in danger of losing his seat to the Republican 
Ron Johnson
. And here's the latest. It's 
Johnson
 with the edge, 49-to-47 percent. And some recent polling in Republican-held seats now. The contest in 
Alaska
, this has been a wild one. Republican Senator 
Lisa Murkowski
, she's waging a write-in 
campaign
 against the 
tea party
 candidate 
Joe Miller
. He defeated her, of course, in the 
Republican primary
. Well, 
the two of them
 in a 
dead heat
 at 37 percent. You have the Democrat 
Scott McAdams
 at 23 percent. And in 
Florida
, another three-way contest. Republican nominee 
Marco Rubio
 leading independent Governor 
Charlie Crist
 and Democratic nominee Congressman 
Kendrick Meek
. 
Rubio
 at 41 percent, 
Crist
 at 26, 
Kendrick Meek
 at 20 percent. And then finally 
Kentucky
. A Republican 
open seat
, 
tea party
 candidate 
Rand Paul
 is locked in a close and an increasingly nasty race against 
state attorney general
Jack Conway
. New poll out this morning indicating 
Rand Paul
 at 48 percent, a five-point spread over 
Jack Conway
. So those are some of the latest polls. 
Let's talk
, overall, about the landscape, and I'll do it with my roundtable here, as I make my way over to them. Joining me to break it all down, 
E.J. Dionne
 of 
The Washington Post
, 
The New York Times
' 
David Brooks
, 
MSNBC
's 
Rachel Maddow
, 
CNBC
's 
Rick Santelli
, and former Democratic Congressman, author of ""More Davids
"
96,"
than Goliaths:
A Politic Education,"" 
Harold Ford Jr
. Welcome to all of you. That was a mouthful, I have to say.
"
97,"
FMR. REP. HAROLD FORD JR. (D-TN):
Nice walk, by the way.
"
98,"
MR. GREGORY:
As we look through the polls -- 
thank you very much
. Thank you. I made it over there safely, which is, which is important to know. 
David Brooks
, again, a snapshot of where we are, what's the 
big picture
 landscape of what's going on here?
"
99,"
MR. DAVID BROOKS:
There's sort of two big pictures. The first one is if you ask generically on the 
national
 level, 
Republicans
 still doing quite well, huge leads among independents. They've got a 59-31 percent lead. So nationally, if you look at those numbers, 
Republicans
 still actually building momentum. In these individual 
Senate
races
, you're seeing a bit of a mixed picture, a lot of tightening. I think, I'm a 
little
 dubious about that 
LA Times
 poll which showed 
Fiorina
 so far down.
"
100,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mm-hmm.
"
101,"
MR. BROOKS:
I think is you average them, she's like down 2 percent. but generally you see tightening in most -- in both 
races
 in opposite directions. So 
Pennsylvania
 got a lot more tight in the Democratic 
direction
. 
Illinois
 moving a 
little
 Republican. But, basically, I think you have a situation where it's candidate-driven, people are disgusted by the candidates in both parties, and they're -- so they're basically flipping a coin.
"
102,"
MR. GREGORY:
And 
Rachel Maddow
, you look at the, the 
national
 overhang here, 
President Obama
's 
approval rating
, we had a new poll out this week. He's still upside down, disapproval at 49 percent to approval 47 percent. If you listen to the 
White House
 and talking to advisers there this week, they say, ""Look, there's a possibility of something that's more of a 
split decision
."" 
Senate
states
 with the 
Democrats
. You heard 
Michael Steele
 say the 
House
 is going to go to 
Republicans
, in his view. And some key 
governors
races
 showing some tightening and some good news for 
Democrats
. What do we see?
"
103,"
MS. RACHEL MADDOW:
I think that the initial diagnosis that 
Democrats
 don't care and were going to be -- weren't going to be able to turn out, that they weren't going to be able to get off their hands and actually get out to the polls this year has turned out to be a 
little
 bit of -- a 
little
 bit wrong. We're seeing the high Democratic numbers in terms of early voting, for example. But, you know, it was less than two years ago that this 
country
 turned out and elected 
Barack Obama
 by seven points, by 
10 million
 votes, and it was -- for the second straight 
election
, elected a hugely greater 
number
 of 
Democrats
 to 
Congress
 and the 
Senate
 than they did 
Republicans
, and that was less than two years ago. I don't think the 
country
 has changed that much. We, at that time, in 
2008
, saw people screaming about the president's birth certificate and imagining everybody was a Muslim and fainting at the sight of 
Sarah Palin
. I mean, those people existed in 
2008
, as well, but they lost. And so I think that the narrative has been very exciting on the 
Republican side
, but I don't think the 
country
 has changed as much since 
2008
 as the narrative would suggest.
"
104,"
MR. GREGORY:

Rick Santelli
, the president has been out there campaigning, campaigning hard, and he's made some, some statements that have certainly gotten people's backs up certainly on the right, and this was one of them. Campaigning in 
Boston
, he said this at a
"
105,"
fundraising dinner:
""Part of the reason that our politics seems so tough right now, and facts and science and argument does not seem to be winning the day all the time, is because we're hard- wired not to always think clearly when we are scared. And the 
country
 is scared, and they have good reason to be."" Is that's what's driving a lot of this mood?
"
106,"
MR. RICK SANTELLI:
I don't the president appears that fearful, actually. I think that comment's a 
little
 overrated with regard to the politicians being afraid. I think, if you look at the 
fear factor
, the anomaly was that the last 
election
cycle
 there was fear. There was fear over the credit crisis. There was fear over the big hiccup in globalization. I think that there is a certain amount of level-headed thinking that's coming in, back into the electorate, and I think they're going to vote out the incumbents. So I think the fear 
cycle
 was the last 
election
. I think the fear 
cycle
 at this point is in the politicians that are trying to hold on to what was the anomaly of a changing regime in the '08 
cycle
.
"
107,"
MR. GREGORY:
E.J. and, and 
Harold
, both, what about the messaging from the president and 
Democrats
? 
Bill Clinton
 has been all over the 
country
, he's got another 22 stops planned in the last nine days, 
E.J. There
's been reporting that he's been baffled that there isn't a tighter 
message
 on the Democratic side about jobs, jobs, jobs. The president's talked about 
Boehner
 and 
Karl Rove
, and now he's talking about, you know, clear thinking not winning out. Is this a right way to 
campaign
?
"
108,"
MR. E.J. DIONNE:
I think a lot of 
Democrats
 out there are struck by the fact that there was not a clear overriding 
message
 from the beginning, whereas the 
Republicans
 have had this list. And it doesn't really answer any problems, but they talk about debt, taxes, unemployment and the like. The candidates I've seen out there that are actually coming up -- I think 
Joe Sestak
 in 
Pennsylvania
's a good example, I was up there yesterday -- are the ones saying, ""Yes, I voted for the stimulus, and here's why, and here's the good it did. Yes, I voted for 
health care
, and here's why, and here's what good it did."" 
And I
 think that 
Democrats
 would be better served sort of embracing what they've done, explaining it, and even bragging about it a 
little
 bit. But on the overall race, I, I walked into a 
Sestak
 headquarters in 
Harrisburg
, and this lovely man at a 
call center
 was making calls for 
Sestak
 and he said, ""Look, we 
Democrats
 are procrastinators. We engage late."" 
And I
 think the best hope 
Democrats
 have for closing these gaps is that that gentleman is right there, that procrastination will 
turn into
 engagement at the very end. And that's the 
fight
 right now.
"
109,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, but, 
Harold
, you know, the big driver of the big change 
elections
 -- 
2006
, 
1994
 -- is whether people think the 
country
's headed in the right 
direction
 or the wrong 
direction
. This is what it was for 
October 20
 -- 
2006
 and 
October 1994
, people feeling the 
country
's on the wrong track, 61 percent and 55 percent respectively in terms of being on the wrong track. Where are we today? Our new polling out this week, October of 
2010
, 59 percent of 
Americans
 think the 
country
's off on the wrong track. Very difficult.
"
110,"
REP. FORD:
The question is -- there's no doubt, and that 
number
 doesn't bode well. The question is whether or not people believe 
Republicans
 can lead us in a different and better 
direction
. I think the president -- there's a lot to be said about what they didn't have and how they could have had a tighter 
message
, and I'm in that camp. Yet, I think one of the things he's been able to achieve is to get out and remind 
Democrats
 why they elected him, what he represents, and that he's still president, and that he needs the help of some 
Democrats
, not tea partiers, not those way outside of the mainstream on the 
Republican side
. Now, the bigger question is, what happens after this 
election
? 
Assume Democrats
 hold narrow majorities in both, and there's a chance we absolutely could. The likelihood is we won't, but the chance is we could. I think the president and 
Democrats
 are going to have to take a very, very different approach than they have up to this point. They're going to have to be willing for more reconciliation with the other side. They're going to have to be more focused on growth and jobs, and there might even have to be some admissions about mistakes that were made.
"
111,"
Because one thing is clear:
Even if we hold, the approach has not been the right approach over the last two years. The goals have been laudable and the right ones, but the approach certainly deserves some tinkering, if not major reshaping.
"
112,"
MR. GREGORY:
Look, let me dig in on some issues here. This 
debate
 about 
outside money
, 
David
, I just asked Chairman 
Steele
 about it, and he seemed to be dismissive of this as a 
problem
, as a real factor in the race, says he's for 
transparency
 but doesn't see a 
problem
 that you've had such big donations coming from outside groups where we don't know where they're coming from and who they are. 
Mike Isikoff
, who I referenced in that interview, has done some reporting on this, and he talked to us about some of what his reporting shows him. Take a look.
"
113,"

"
114,"
MR. MIKE ISIKOFF:
Not since the days of 
Watergate
 have we seen 
special interest
money
 pouring into 
political campaigns
 with no 
transparency
, no disclosure about 
where the money is
 coming from. You've got groups being set up around the 
country
 with names that voters have never heard of bombarding the airwaves with 
campaign ads
. 
And I
 think what this is doing is confusing voters more than enlightening them because they have no idea who's behind these ads or what the 
agenda
 is of the people who are running them.
"
115,"

"
116,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yet, you wrote, 
David
, this week, you don't think this is a 
big deal
. You think this is more hype than real.
"
117,"
MR. BROOKS:
I think it's tremendously corrupting in 
Washington
. The question is, does it affect the electorate?
"
118,"
MR. GREGORY:
Hm.
"
119,"
MR. BROOKS:

And I
 guess, does it affect voters? A couple things. First, it's important to remember the 
outside money
 is only 10 percent of the total 
money
. Most, most 
money
 is still candidates-driven and it's 
party
-driven. The second thing is the 
money
 is flowing in on both sides. 
AFSCME
, the 
public sector
 worker, $87 
million
; the 
NEA
, $40 
million
. So there's a ton of 
money
. Though that is...
"
120,"
MR. GREGORY:
But you do know where they're coming from.
"
121,"
MR. BROOKS:
Right. That's, that's exactly right. The untransparent 
money
 is a genuine 
problem
. But then this third thing, and the final thing, is does it affect voters? We've got $3.5 billion being spent on this 
election
. Some of these outside funds like 
Karl Rove
's 
American Crossroads
, they're spending $12 
million
. Do we really think that's affecting? And then if you've got a race like in 
Colorado
, where the Democrat and the Republican are each throwing 5,000 ads at each other, do we really think if one candidate throws 7,000 as opposed to 5,000, it's going to make a big difference? I really don't think so.
"
122,"
MR. GREGORY:
E.J., you do.
"
123,"
MR. DIONNE:
Yeah, I think it makes -- first of all, 
Karl Rove
's group is spending a lot more than $12 
million
, by their own account. There's a lot more 
money
 coming in.
"
124,"
MR. BROOKS:
Maybe a quarter of what 
AFSCME
 is.
"
125,"
MR. DIONNE:
In total...
"
126,"
MS. MADDOW:
That's not true, actually.
"
127,"
MR. DIONNE:
...these secret conservative groups are going to spend about $200, $220 million according to the current estimates. The 
money
 matters. And secret 
money
 is corrupting, secret 
money
 is dangerous, secret 
money
, as 
Mike Isikoff
 said, leads to scandal. And the 
Watergate
 -- we forget that a lot of, of -- a big piece of the 
Watergate scandal
 was secret 
money
. And to say this 
money
 doesn't matter is to say that 
Karl Rove
, who really cares a lot about politics, is wasting his time trying to raise all this 
money
; 
Ed Gillespie
, who knows a lot about politics, is wasting his time. And for voters -- you know, people will know about this 
money
. The congressmen are going to know who helped them get elected. The only people 
kept in the dark
 are the voters. This is a huge deal, and it's historic and it's dangerous.
"
128,"
MS. MADDOW:
Yeah.
"
129,"
MR. GREGORY:

Rachel
, go.
"
130,"
MS. MADDOW:
I mean, the, the 
Rove
money
 -- I mean, I, I don't know where you're getting the $12 
million
money
 -- 
number
.
"
131,"
MR. BROOKS:
That's from the 
Center for Responsive Politics
.
"
132,"
MS. MADDOW:
They're bragging on raising and spending $52 
million
. They said that was their initial goal, and now they say they're going to blow past that and spend significantly more. So the numbers -- we 
fight
 over the numbers. One of the issues, though, is that they're not disclosed. 
Seventy-two
 percent of people in the last 
NBC
/
Wall Street Journal
 poll said it concerns them that they do not know who is funding these 
political
 ads. 
And I
 think part of the issue is not just that there's these big 
PACs
, but it's the individual people. The, the owner of the 
Chicago Cubs
 could legally contribute $2,400 to 
Sharron Angle
, who's his chosen candidate.
"
133,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
134,"
MS. MADDOW:
He doesn't live in 
Nevada
, that's his -- but he's spending $600,000 personally for 
Sharron Angle
 in 
Nevada
. That is of concern.
"
135,"
MR. GREGORY:
But here, but here's the issue. But, but, 
Rick Santelli
, the -- part of the issue here is that 
this is the law
 of the land, OK? Now, is there the 
political
 will, and 
Democrats
 are in 
control
, to actually change the law? Because 
Michael Steele
 was right, 
this is the law
. You want to change all of this, 
Democrats
 and 
Republicans
 have to agree to change the law because this is what the 
Supreme Court
 has passed.
"
136,"
MS. MADDOW:

Democrats
 tried, 
Republicans
 blocked it.
"
137,"
MR. SANTELLI:
You know, the pendulum of 
money
 swings both ways, and depending on the year, the 
state
 of the incumbency, the outcome of the 
elections
, different sides cry foul louder than other sides. But, in the end, there is a process. I personally think 
money
 in politics on any level is horrible. I'd like to see a set amount and have every candidate spend it. Have it be completely transparent. But actually getting to that spot, as we have learned through all the legislation over the decades, is very difficult. But, yes, whether it's the 
Supreme Court
 or some of these issues regarding 
transparency
, there is a process. I am a firm believer in process.
"
138,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, well, I'm going to -- we're going to take a break here. 
Harold
's going to start us off in the next segment, we're going to talk about some of the, the key issues going on in some of these 
races
, as well as the controversy over 
Juan Williams
. More from our roundtable after this brief 
station break
. Don't go away.
"
139,"

"
140,"
MR. GREGORY:
We're back with more of our 
political
 roundtable, where the conversation hasn't stopped even during the break. I want to talk inside some of these 
races
, some other trends, the vulnerability and the strength of the 
tea party
 in this race. 
Rick Santelli
, of -- everyone knows, of course, you are, though you're, you're a mild-mannered man, but 
you are the father
 of the 
tea party
, as you sit there. Look at some of the impact, the 
Delaware Senate
 race, 
Chris Coons
, 
Christine O'Donnell
, she was supported by the 
tea party
, 
Sarah Palin
 -- by the way, this is not a close race. She's way behind. You wouldn't know that by all the attention it's getting. And some of her statements in the course of this 
campaign
, beyond having to say that she was not a witch in a 
campaign ad
, she's gotten a lot of attention for. This 
debate
 about the 
First Amendment
, whether she understood really what was in the 
First Amendment
, 
separation of church and state
. Does she hurt the Republican brand as someone who a lot of people feel is not qualified to be a Senator?
"
141,"
MR. SANTELLI:
I think that there's been a lot of people in 
Congress
 that didn't know all the ins and outs of the 
Constitution
. I think we have a whole roomful of people that have record legislation in terms of quantity of pages that didn't read it. Who am I to say or, or put words in the mouth of the electorate in 
Delaware
? I think that the 
tea party
 movement is terrific. It's created discourse that might not have otherwise occurred. It's happened in breakneck speed against all odds. Neither of the medias, left or right, I think, really were very happy that they showed up on the doorstep. And as far as 
O'Donnell
, you know, she's a lot more normal, less elite, and I think she's going to make mistakes. Whether she has or not, is not for me to say, but the 
tea party
's going to be -- the movement's going to be messy...
"
142,"
MR. GREGORY:
But, 
Harold
...
"
143,"
MR. SANTELLI:
...because you're bringing in outsiders.
"
144,"
MR. GREGORY:

Harold
, if you look at the impact she may have had on the 
Pennsylvania
 race, if you're sitting in 
Philadelphia
, you watch 
TV
 from 
Delaware
, and do -- are there a lot of 
Democrats
, independents who say, ""If that's the Republican brand this year, maybe I want to go with a 
Sestak
""?
"
145,"
REP. FORD:
If 
Christine O'Donnell
 had answered the question like 
Rick Santelli
 did when asked about 
separation of church and state
 or other things she may not know about and say, ""Look, I don't know the full answer to that. Let me tell you why I'm running."" She almost celebrated the fact that she didn't know it and even went further and suggested that what clearly is in the 
Constitution
 is not in the 
Constitution
. 
Look
, 
at the end of the day
, the fact that she won that 
primary
, I thought 
Michael Steele
's answer was a pretty good one on it when asked whether or not she was qualified. Voters in 
Delaware
, like a lot of voters around the 
country
, saying, ""If the guys in 
Washington
 are so smart today, how come we're in the mess we're in today? Maybe we ought to send some people there that are not as smart or not as smart as people in 
Washington
 may think."" Now, I happen to think 
Christine O'Donnell
 is just -- is not qualified for a 
number
 of other reasons. I disagree with her on a 
number
 of fronts, and I think 
Chris Coons
 has done a phenomenal job at pointing out where she's weak. The big issue for 
Democrats
 heading into this last week or so, I think is what 
President Clinton
 has tried to say and what 
President Obama
 is trying to do, which is, ""Look at where we've come. Look at the mess we've gotten out of. We've got a 
long way to go
, give us two more years here, and if we don't get this right, then you have the right to remove us from, from 
power
. Until then, give us a chance to stay on path, because if you push us the other way, we're going to go back to the mess that got us into this 
problem
 that we're facing today.""
"
146,"
MR. GREGORY:
Look at, 
Rachel
, look at what's happening in 
Nevada
, where you've got 
Harry Reid
, the majority leader, 
Sharron Angle
, a 
tea party
 candidate, who didn't appear to be in this race, she's come back. Both are really disliked in this race, quite frankly...
"
147,"
MS. MADDOW:
Mm-hmm.
"
148,"
MR. GREGORY:
...and yet it's a close race. She's running an ad that is reminiscent of what was done to Majority Leader 
Tom Daschle
, you know, really capturing that anti-
establishment
 sentiment out there. This is an ad she's running against 
Reid
.
"
149,"

"
150,"
Narrator:

Harry
 lives at the 
Ritz-Carlton
 while thousands are losing their homes. The nation needs a new 
direction
 and 
Nevada
 needs jobs. Say no to 
Harry Reid
.
"
151,"

"
152,"
MS. MADDOW:
Say no to 
Harry Reid
 because of where he lives is remarkable. I mean, the 
Sharron Angle
campaign
, I think, is instructive. Once the Republican 
establishment
 got over their discomfort with her winning that 
primary
, the 
money
 has just poured, poured, poured into that race. She also ran an ad in that race that I think is the most overtly racist ad of this 
campaign
 season, showing a group of 
white
 college students being menaced by some tough looking 
Latinos
. The 
Sharron Angle
 race, I think, is, is, is important -- it's the highest profile race in the 
country
 -- because for a lot of 
Democrats
, there is no 
national
message
. That's absolutely true. 
Democrats
 decided they didn't want a 
national
message
. But in almost every race, the Democratic 
message
 to get out the base is three words, ""
Google
 my opponent."" Look at this guy I'm running against. 
Sharron Angle
 says conservatives should be expected to use guns to try to get what they want if they don't get what they want from the 
election
, the 
Second Amendment
 remedies thing; wants people -- a woman who's raped and gets pregnant as the result of rape, to be forced to bear that child. To be able to say, ""Lookit, you may not like me, but look what you're being asked to choose instead of me,"" is the most powerful 
message
 a lot of 
Democrats
 have to share.
"
153,"
MR. GREGORY:
Can I just add...
"
154,"
REP. FORD:
Here's the 
problem
.
"
155,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah.
"
156,"
REP. FORD:
A week away, 
Sharron Angle
 was thought to be so far out of this race, people have characterized her views as so far out of the mainstream. 
At the end of the day
, the only thing on voters' minds is -- are jobs and the 
economy
. What would help in the last week...
"
157,"
MR. SANTELLI:

Google
 the unemployment rate.
"
158,"
REP. FORD:
Right. Exactly. What would help at the end of the, at the end of this last week, in addition to 
Obama
 and 
Clinton
 who -- 
Clinton
, I think, has a great 
message
 on this, is to talk about what we're going to do to create jobs. 
Stay away
 from attacking these guys personally, 
stay away
 from talking about foreign 
money
.
"
159,"
MR. SANTELLI:
Yeah...
"
160,"
REP. FORD:

Money
 is in politics, it's been there. I was in politics for 10 years, I had some of the worst ads run against me ever. I had some of the most 
money
 spent by a guy in my 
state
 running against me. That's not the issue. The issue is getting out and making the case for what we're going to do to create jobs and to make the economic situation for individual families better.
"
161,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, to that point...
"
162,"
MR. BROOKS:

"
163,"
MR. GREGORY:
Hold on, 
David Brooks
. To that point, 
Fortune magazine
, I think, has an interesting piece about how difficult it is for the 
government
 really to move something on the 
economy
, and here's a portion, I'll put it up on the screen. And this is really something for 
Republicans
 to deal with. ""The latest tax-cut screed, the 
Republican party
's 
Pledge
 to 
America
, is economically incoherent. It has no meaningful numbers, proposes no changes in programs like 
Social Security
, 
Medicare
, and defense, and asks no sacrifices of anyone, yet says it can balance the budget. Good luck with that."" Where are the sacrifices that 
Republicans
 are asking voters to make to put them back into 
power
, if they're in 
power
?
"
164,"
MR. BROOKS:
They're not. I mean, I mean, to talk -- first on the issues...
"
165,"
MR. GREGORY:
And a question for 
Democrats
, too, by the way.
"
166,"
MR. BROOKS:
Right. I mean, it might be offensive to talk about the issues, but the reason the 
Democrats
 are in a mess here is that, first, the 
economy
's bad; second, their, their -- the policies are unpopular. 
Health care
 has like 38 percent approval. So, but going back to those core issues, voters are not insane, they're going to vote on those core issues. The 
problem
 is that the 
country
 -- 
and I
 think the polls are pretty clear about this -- the 
country
 right now is not willing to make the sacrifices the way the 
British people
 are that is necessary to get us back in some sort of fiscal situation that's stable. We know it has to be done. We have to means tests entitlements, that means take away some of the 
middle class
 tax subsidies. We have to raise taxes. We probably need to raise taxes on consumption. We're going to probably have to repeal all of the 
Bush tax cuts
, the 
middle class
 and the rich, at some point. 
That's what
 has to be done. The American people sort of don't accept that yet, and the polls show that. And, as a result, neither 
party
 is willing to face that.
"
167,"
MR. GREGORY:

E.J. Dionne
, I have to switch quickly because we only have a couple of minutes left in this segment. Something that you wanted to talk about and has been a big issue this week, 
Juan Williams
 being fired as analyst at 
NPR
. 
The Republicans
, you heard 
Michael Steele
 talk about it, they're making it a 
campaign
 issue saying 
NPR
's 
money
 should be cut. Did 
NPR
 do the wrong thing here?
"
168,"
MR. DIONNE:
See, I think there are two issues here. The first issue is, 
NPR
 is quite simply 
one of the best
 news organizations in the world, and anybody who thinks that they are liberal biased, I challenge them to do what a student of mine once did at 
Georgetown
, take a week of transcripts, take a month of transcripts and examine it for 
political
 bias. You're not going to find it. 
Fox News
, 
on the other hand
, is a Republican propaganda network that put into circulation the false idea that 
Obama
 went to -- 
President Obama
 went to a madrassa, and they stoked the 
tea party
. They stoked, not the 
tea party
 movement, but the death panels. That's on the one side. 
On the other side
, I think 
NPR
 made a mistake in the way they handled this. I was a member of a union for a long time. I think employees, contract employees included, deserve some respect. What they should've said is sat 
Juan Williams
 down, he's done a lot of good work for them, and say, ""Look, you have a choice here. Look at the context you were on with 
O'Reilly
. You could barely get your points out in the middle of the propaganda. 
Do you want to
 work for 
Fox
, that's OK, but -- or you want to work for us, that's OK. But you've got to decide,"" if I may use 
Fox's
 slogan. They should have handled it that way. But this should not be used to run a 
smear campaign
 against 
NPR
.
"
169,"
MR. GREGORY:

Rick
, does this belong in the 
campaign
?
"
170,"
MR. SANTELLI:
I think that a company can make any choice from a management-employee standpoint that they wish. I think the one issue I see in here is the funding from the 
federal government
. It's not an issue to me. I think the funding could be an issue, but it's not going to alter the 
election
 results in any way. I think what 
Mr. Brooks
 is talking about is the issue austerity. We need leadership. You don't sell belt-tightening in fancy commercials. You don't knock your opponent. What you need to do is you need to tell 
America
 that you can get behind us, we'll 
do the right thing
, it's going to be a bit painful. The reason 
Americans
 aren't buying into it is because they don't trust 
Congress
, and that's the whole epicenter of this 
election
. Maybe we can put some people we trust in. And maybe they're not going to fit the normal mold. That's a good thing. And maybe if we trust them, we'll actually pay higher taxes, and we won't feel bad about it because the outcome will be a better 
country
 and we won't be saying, ""Opa!"" in five years.
"
171,"
MR. GREGORY:

Rachel
, I, I -- address the 
Juan Williams
 issue, too. I want to get your views on that.
"
172,"
MS. MADDOW:
On the 
Juan Williams
 issue, I think it may be an 
election
 issue if 
Jim DeMint
 leads the 
Republicans
 on this, and the 
Republicans
, like they did with 
Newt Gingrich
 in 
power
, decide that they're going to go after 
Big Bird
 and they're going to try to make public -- they're going to go after him like they went after the 
NEA
 and wage 
culture war
 again. On this issue that the 
American people
 just need to be told that belt tightening is the right thing, we just need the right politicians, it makes a lot of sense here at 
MEET THE PRESS
. But 
in the real world
, when you talk about the real politicians and what they're actually putting out there...
"
173,"
MR. SANTELLI:
Because we haven't had any leaders that can sell the idea.
"
174,"
MS. MADDOW:
...the, the prototypical 
tea party
fiscal conservative
 candidate, right, is probably 
Marco Rubio
. 
Marco Rubio
's economic plan right now is to add $3.5 trillion to the deficit. 
That's what
 he's proposing. And he's, he's being marketed as the 
fiscal conservative
 outsider to do that.
"
175,"
MR. BROOKS:
Well, we should mention 
Chris Christie
, the governor of 
New Jersey
, is actually doing it...
"
176,"
MR. SANTELLI:
Exactly.
"
177,"
MR. BROOKS:
...and his 
approval rating
 has gone up.
"
178,"
REP. FORD:
And 
Ed Rendell
...
"
179,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah. Go ahead.
"
180,"
REP. FORD:
...the governor of 
Pennsylvania

NPR
 should not have fired 
Juan Williams
.
"
181,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
182,"
REP. FORD:
If they were going to do it, they should have did it like, like 
E.J.
 said.
"
183,"
MR. DIONNE:
Should I just say, 
David
 and I argue politics on 
NPR
 all the time. So I should disclose that. 
And I
 would note, I'm a liberal. I'm always countered by 
David
 or somebody more conservative than 
David
.
"
184,"
REP. FORD:
Is that possible?
"
185,"
MR. DIONNE:

Thank God
 it is.
"
186,"
MR. GREGORY:
We're going to leave it there for just a moment, but we're going to come back. We're going to get some 
Election Day
 predictions here from the roundtable on the keys to the last couple of weeks. Don't go away. We have one more 
commercial break
.
"
187,"

"
188,"
MR. GREGORY:
We're back. Just a couple of minutes left. 
Harold
, what do you see on 
Election Day
?
"
189,"
REP. FORD:
I think 
Democrats
 can hold both the 
House
 and the 
Senate
 very narrowly if, in this last week, it's all about the 
economy
 and jobs and the president promises to push the reset button with 
Republicans
 and particularly with the 
business community
.
"
190,"
MR. GREGORY:
You're not ready, you're not ready to pronounce the 
House
 is gone?
"
191,"
REP. FORD:
No. No.
"
192,"
MR. GREGORY:
Rick Santelli.
"
193,"
MR. SANTELLI:
I think we're going to send a 
record number
 of incumbents to 
Disney World
 on 
November 3
.
"
194,"
MR. GREGORY:

Rachel
, 
break it down
. Does the 
House
 go?
"
195,"
MS. MADDOW:
I don't know. I'm on -- I'm a bad predictor, I have to say. I think that it's going to be closer than people think. I do not think it's going to be a Republican landslide, but I do think we're going to get a lot more red. I do also think that 
Christine O'Donnell
's new show on 
Fox
 is going to be awesome.
"
196,"
MR. GREGORY:
You'll be a viewer.
"
197,"
MS. MADDOW:
Yeah.
"
198,"
MR. BROOKS:

Democrats
 actually go to the 
Vineyard
, not 
Disney World
, when they lose, so I'm guessing it'll be, it's a guess, 52 seats the 
Republicans
 pick up, but not as many in the 
Senate
 as they think.
"
199,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right. So they, you think 
Democrats
 hold on to the 
Senate
.
"
200,"
MR. BROOKS:
Yeah.
"
201,"
MR. GREGORY:
And, and some of those key governorships, the 
White House
 looking at 
California
, looking at 
Florida
, looking at 
Ohio
, saying that'd be good for 
2012
.
"
202,"
MR. BROOKS:
Yeah. 
Ohio
 is probably Republican, 
California
 probably Democratic, but 
nobody knows
 who's going to show up. That's the big mystery.
"
203,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah. What do you see, 
E.J.
?
"
204,"
MR. DIONNE:
Right now 
Republicans
 would take the 
House
, the 
Democrats
 would hold the 
Senate
. But if the far right in the 
Republican Party
 wakes 
Democrats
 up and they find a coherent economic 
message
, I still think they have a chance of holding on to both, narrowly.
"
205,"
MR. GREGORY:
The, the -- 
Sarah Palin
 was out this week and saying, ""We can see 
2012
 from my 
house
,"" a play on her slipup from 
2008
. 
Harold
, what is the relationship between this midterm race and 
Barack Obama
's run for re-
election
 in 
2012
?
"
206,"
REP. FORD:
Again, I think after the race, the president's got to push the resent button on a 
number
 of fronts. If he does not do that, if we think by holding narrow majorities that we've won somehow or another in this 
election
, we've completely misread the public. They want answers on the debt, they want answers on taxes, and most importantly want answers on growth. If we don't answer that, then it's going to be a -- it's going to be a worse year for, in 
2012
. But he's a 
smart guy
, and the 
White House
 is even smarter.
"
207,"
MR. GREGORY:
Ten seconds, 
Rachel
.
"
208,"
MS. MADDOW:
I think that the 
Goldwaterization
 of the 
Republican Party
 is a, is a possibility. If they do very, very well in these 
elections
, I think that we're seeing a very 
Jesse Helms
culture war
 kind of vibe from Republican candidates, and that may push the 
2012
 candidates way to the right in the Republican...
"
209,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. We have...
"
210,"
REP. FORD:

Chris Christie
 is not that way. He's formidable. He's not a 
culture war
 guy.
"
211,"
MR. GREGORY:
That's true. All right. We're going to leave it there. Thank you all very much. Before we go, a few quick programming notes. Watch 
MSNBC
 tomorrow night at 
9 PM
 Eastern for the documentary ""The 
Assassination

220,(Videotape)
221,MR. MICHAEL STEELE:  You ready to win?  You ready to fire Pelosi?  You ready to take down Harry Reid?
222,(End videotape)
223,"MR. GREGORY:  Can a Republican send Majority Leader Harry Reid back home and remove Democrats from power in the House?  And how will their embrace of the tea party play out on Election Day and beyond?  With us exclusively this morning, the man at the center of it all, the leader of the Republican Party, Chairman Michael Steele.  Plus, we'll look at the latest polls.  Who's up, who's down and who's pulling out all the stops?  As the president spends the week trying to rally the Democratic base out West, the right declares war on National Public Radio after the abrupt firing of news analyst and commentator Juan Williams.  We'll look at it all with our expanded roundtable:  David Brooks of The New York Times, E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post, former Democratic Congressman Harold Ford Jr., MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, and CNBC's Rick Santelli."
224,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
225,"MR. GREGORY:  And good morning.  Well, here we are.  The final countdown to election day 2010.  With us exclusively this morning, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele."
226,Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
227,"MR. STEELE:  It's great to be back with you, David."
228,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's get right to it.  It's final argument time and the president is on the campaign trail.  He's been out West, he was in the Midwest.  And on Friday he leveled probably his most potent charge against Republican leaders in Washington, saying that they made a cold political calculation when he came into office, basically not to work with the Obama White House, that they could've cooperated, decided to obstruct.  This is part of what he said."
229,"(Videotape, Friday)"
230,"PRES. OBAMA:  The Republican leaders in Washington, they made a different calculation.  They, they looked around at the mess that they had made, at the mess that they had left me, and they said, ""Boy, this is a really big mess."" And they said, ""It's going to take a long time to fix, so maybe if we just sit on the sidelines, say no to everything, and then point our fingers at Obama and say he's to blame,"" they figure that maybe y'all would forget that they caused the mess in the first place, and they'd be able to ride anger all the way to election time."
231,(End videotape)
232,"MR. GREGORY:  Chairman, what's your answer to that, your vision of what the story of the last two years has been?"
233,"MR. STEELE:  Well, it actually sounded more like a pity party than a rally. I mean, I can't believe the president's sitting there with, with hindsight saying that we didn't cooperate, that Republican leaders did not cooperate with the president.  I think from health care to the environment to the economy, Republicans in the House and the Senate had made, made very clear, ""This is what we'd like to do, let's talk about healthcare reform that includes tort reform, that includes other types of mechanisms that will keep sacrosanct the doctor-patient relationship and not put government in the middle of that.  Let's talk about job creation by stimulating small businesses and not the federal government."" And so the ideas that were put on the table, a lot of them propounded by folks like Mr. Boehner and Eric Cantor and, and Paul Ryan were summarily rejected.  In fact, as you recall, David, Republican leaders, particularly specific members, couldn't even get a meeting with the president.  They tried, after sending letters and requests, to sit down and go through the president's agenda to see how we could help.  We're hoping for a better relationship between the White House and the Republican Congress come January."
234,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, let me ask you about the landscape right now.  What do you see out there?  What are we looking at on Election Day?  Is this a huge GOP wave that takes the House and the Senate?  What are your views at this point?"
235,"MR. STEELE:  David, there is, there is a vibration out here that is unlike anything I've ever seen before.  I've been on my ""Fire Pelosi"" bus since September 15th.  We get off the bus on October 30th, and in that time, what I've seen is a consistent groundswell of, of excitement and energy towards this election.  The voters are tired of the fact that the federal government has not listened to them over the past two years, has moved in its own direction at its own rhythm, and they want to pull back on that.  And I think you're going to see a wave, an unprecedented wave, on Election Day that's going to surprise a lot of people."
236,MR. GREGORY:  What does that mean?
237,MR. STEELE:  And now--both the House and the Senate...
238,MR. GREGORY:  What does that mean in terms of the balance of power?
239,MR. STEELE:  ...and state legislatures.
240,MR. GREGORY:  What does it mean to the balance of power?
241,"MR. STEELE:  Well, I think the--oh, I absolutely believe in the House the balance of power will shift, as I like to say, with 38 seats, and we need to get to 39 to, to, to get control, but I think we're more than there."
242,MR. GREGORY:  You say the House will go to the Republicans.  What about the Senate?
243,"MR. STEELE:  The Senate's a little bit tougher, but I think we're going to be there.  If this wave continues the way it's going, it has been over the last few weeks, especially, I think you could see the Senate, as well, go to the Republicans."
244,"MR. GREGORY:  There's been, there's been a lot of negative attention towards some tea party-backed candidates in some of the statements that they've made, whether it's Sharron Angle speaking to a group of Latinos in Nevada, or Ken Buck's statements about gays on this program last week, or Christine O'Donnell..."
245,MR. STEELE:  Mm-hmm.
246,"MR. GREGORY:  ...who's gotten so much attention, except for the fact that she's very far behind in that Senate race, she's had some both misstatements or gaffs in the course of her debate with Chris Coons."
247,MR. STEELE:  Sure.
248,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you think she's actually undermining the Republican brand, specifically?"
249,"MR. STEELE:  No, I don't.  I mean, Chris, you know, folks make mistakes. Lord knows I'm familiar with, you know, foot in mouth disease.  I understand how that is sometimes when you get in the heat of a battle, you've got the passion and the fire in your belly, and you really want to get out there and, and speak to the issues and speak to the people, you say things that don't come out correctly.  You make missteps, you make--you create misperceptions. And I think that happens a lot in campaigns.  It happens on both sides."
250,"What really matters is how the voters receive that, how the voters look at those candidates.  And despite those, those foibles and those flaws, if you will, of, of the misspoken word, people understand where their heart is. People understand these folks are going to go out there and fight for them. And, as I said a little bit earlier, David, this, this, this reality right now for people is, is that we want a leadership that's going to listen to us.  We want someone who's going to take the fight to Congress and not fight against us.  And, you know, whether it's Christine O'Donnell or Sharron Angle, whomever it happens to be, who's got this groundswell of energy behind them, I think that that's what really matters to the people right now."
251,MR. GREGORY:  Is she qualified to be a U.S. senator?  Would she be a good senator?
252,"MR. STEELE:  I think she would be.  You know, again, I don't get to make that judgment.  The people in her state get to make that judgment.  They're the ones who vote for her.  They're the ones who nominated her.  And so, for the establishment in Washington or anywhere else to sit back and sit in judgment of her abilities to be a senator, to be effective in the Senate is misplaced. What--all that matters is the people have decided, ""This is, this is the standard-bearer we want."" And the, and the real push and the fight now is the general election.  And the, and the broader population of voters in the state of Delaware, California, Florida, around the country are going to make the decision about the Republican standard-bearers that we have."
253,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you, Chairman..."
254,MR. STEELE:  And I think at the end of the day we're going to do very well.
255,"MR. GREGORY:  Chairman, let me ask you about the role of outside money in this campaign.  It is a big area of debate."
256,MR. STEELE:  Sure.
257,"MR. GREGORY:  And the Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, appeared on MSNBC's ""Countdown with Keith Olbermann"" this week, and she, like the president, described it as a real threat to the country's democracy.  This is a part of what she had to say."
258,"(Videotape, Thursday)"
259,SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI:  This election is also about our democracy.
260,MR. KEITH OLBERMANN:  Mm-hmm.
261,"SPEAKER PELOSI:  If they win, which I fully intend to stop them from doing, but if they were to win, it would mean that we are now a plutocracy and an oligarchy, whatever these few wealthy, secret, unlimited sources of money are can control our entire agenda."
262,(End videotape)
263,"MR. GREGORY:  Our investigative correspondent, Mike Skiff, has said that ""Not since Watergate have we seen this kind of special interest money without transparency washing into an election cycle."" Are you worried about this?"
264,"MR. STEELE:  No.  I don't know what they're talking about.  No one's produced one shred of evidence that any of that is happening.  And, you know, I--look, you know, when President, then candidate, Obama was asked to disclose some of his donors because there was suspicion of their being, you know, the foreign source of money into his campaign, they refused to do it.  So don't give me this high and mighty, you know, holier than thou attitude about, about special interests flooding, flooding the political marketplace.  The Democrats have been dabbling in those areas and clearly disclose it.  If you, if you think that there's something out there, disclose it, Nancy.  Disclose it, you know, anyone else who's got that evidence.  Don't just make the charge and sit back and say, ""Oh gee, see."" Give, give the evidence.  Put the evidence out there and then let's have that discussion about whether or not they are, in fact, foreign..."
265,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Chairman, are you denying, are you denying that there is special interest money, that there's outside money that's coming into the campaign that is not being disclosed?"
266,MR. STEELE:  I...
267,"MR. GREGORY:  We don't know who the individuals are in these, some of these groups that are sponsored?"
268,"MR. STEELE:  I--Dave, how would, how would I, how, how would I know that?  I don't run those organizations, number one.  I'm prohibited by law from engaging such--in such activity, number two.  So I know we don't take it, and I suspect that those organizations out there, those 527s and others know what the law is and are complying with the law.  So if you have evidence to the contrary, produce it.  Otherwise, put up or shut up."
269,"MR. GREGORY:  OK, but..."
270,MR. STEELE:  It's just that--that's it.  Put up or shut up.
271,"MR. GREGORY:  Chairman, I, I'm putting up with this question, which is are you concerned that because, as you know, there are laws that you do not have to disclose.  That's the question.  Is that a problem in our politics..."
272,MR. STEELE:  Right.
273,MR. GREGORY:  ...when you can put a great deal of money into a campaign without disclosing your agenda or who you are?
274,"MR. STEELE:  Well, OK, David, that's a fair question.  Well, that's a fair question."
275,"MR. GREGORY:  You said put up or shut up, that's the issue."
276,"MR. STEELE:  Then the Congress needs to--then, then the, then, then the put up part by the Congress would be to change the law.  But the law is what it is right now, and everybody's compliant with the law.  And if the law does not require disclosure of certain individuals or information, then..."
277,"MR. GREGORY:  I'm asking you, is that a problem?"
278,"MR. STEELE:  I don't, I don't know that it is so far.  I mean, I haven't seen any evidence that it is.  Why, why are you saying it's a problem?"
279,MR. GREGORY:  I'm asking whether you think--there are certainly candidates running who are Republicans who think there ought to be more transparency. Ken Buck from Colorado thinks that you should definitely say where the money comes from if you're getting it in a campaign.
280,"MR. STEELE:  Absolute--I--David, absolutely.  I'm always--I'm--at the end of the day, I agree with--I am absolutely all for transparency.  It's--I think it's an appropriate part of the system.  It instills the trust that people have in the system, and it also avoids questions like this because that, that information is out there.  And it's absolutely will avoid the, the allegations and the charges just thrown out there in the middle of a, of a, of a, of a discussion about health care and the economy."
281,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Let...
282,"MR. STEELE:  So I agree, the transparency should be there.  But the law is what the law is right now.  And if people are that bothered by it, then the Congress needs to change it."
283,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about another hot button issue this week, the firing of Juan Williams, the analyst at NPR and Fox News Channel.  It has become a point of debate in, in the course of the campaign."
284,MR. STEELE:  Yeah.
285,"MR. GREGORY:  Eric Cantor, the Republican whip, issued a statement on Friday saying the following:  ""Over-reaching political correctness is chipping away at the fundamental American freedoms of speech and expression.  NPR's decision to fire Williams not only undermines that, it shows an ignorance of the fact that radical Islam and the terrorists who murder in its name scare people of all faiths, religions, and beliefs.  In light of their rash decision, we will include termination of federal funding for NPR as an option in the YouCut program so that Americans can let it be known whether they want their dollars going to that organization."" Is this a legitimate part of the campaign?"
286,"MR. STEELE:  I don't know if it's a legitimate part of the campaign.  I think what NPR did was overreaching.  I think it was a hyperextended overreaction to his comments.  He was expressing a personal perspective, he wasn't giving a political analysis.  He wasn't, he wasn't being a pundit about the matter.  He was expressing his own personal concerns that he had.  I think that the more appropriate thing would have been to, as we've seen in other cases when, you know, a Tina Noten, for instance, made outlandish comments about, you know, Strom Thurmond or others getting AIDS and, and all of this stuff.  You take them aside, just sit them down and go, ""Wait a minute, that's a line you don't, you don't need to cross."" I think, you know, immediately jumping to firing Juan over this was a, was a overreaction.  And I think you've seen the reaction, not just by Republicans, but by a whole lot of folks out there around the country, as they, you know, ""Really?"" The--this is, this is not the appropriate way to, to really handle this.  And I think that, you know, NPR is paying a little bit of a price for it."
287,"MR. GREGORY:  Should, should federal funding for NPR be cut?"
288,"MR. STEELE:  That's not my decision.  I'm sure the members of the Congress who, who've raised that as a concern will, will address that at the appropriate time.  But I think right now my focus and the focus of those of us who are on the political side of this equation are much more interested in getting to the elections on November 2 so we can win and put in place a new Congress to look at questions like that."
289,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let's end with just a couple of points about politics. What does the midterm result, in your mind, say about 2012?"
290,"MR. STEELE:  Ah, good question.  I think, I think it's a transitional pattern.  I think, you know, puts us all at a point where, you know, you kind of look down the road to 2012 and say what--for the Republicans, what kind of leader is going to emerge to deal more precisely with the economy, with our relations overseas, with, you know, those concerns that people have about jobs here in the country?  I think it may be a harbinger of a very exciting, you know, campaign in '12.  Particularly if we do not take the Senate this time, the Senate would, would be in full play in 2012.  You would still have the addition of additional House seats that would be out there, as well as some state legislative races so--and governors races.  So I think this election cycle in 2010 really lays an interesting foundation for how we go forward. Because you--you're looking at two very different philosophical views of the country."
291,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you, do you think that President Obama's a one-term president?"
292,"MR. STEELE:  I don't know that.  Again, you know, my job is to make sure he is, but, you know, because I--we philosophically disagree with the direction the president is going.  And I think that, you know, the spending, the debt, the deficit, the burden that's been placed on the backs of future generations is unsustainable.  And, and, you know, we've seen that the administration, along with Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, are kind of whistling past that graveyard, ignoring the hard facts that we cannot sustain nor afford the continued spending policies of this administration."
293,"And there are other concerns out there as well with respect to, again, our relation with--relationships with Israel, our, our relationships with North Korea.  All of these concerns need to be addressed, and I think have pretty much not been, effectively, by the administration.  So you're going to see over the next two years, I think, the president try to, you know, step up his game a little bit.  But we'll be there step for step on all of these issues, clearly delineating the difference between a government that wants to take and redistribute wealth, and a free people who are there to create that wealth and save it for the future."
294,"MR. GREGORY:  And finally, Chairman, let me ask you about your own leadership.  You say that you will be judged on..."
295,MR. STEELE:  Mm-hmm.
296,"MR. GREGORY:  ...whether the party wins this fall and whether you can raise money.  Well, the hard truth is that the RNC has really fallen down in terms of raising money.  The committee is in debt, you've been really outraised by the Democrats, and yet this is such a positive environment for Republicans. And the criticism has been harsh.  It's been summed up by Fred Barnes in a op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal."
297,MR. STEELE:  Yeah.
298,"MR. GREGORY:  Here's a portion of what he said:  ""Mr. Steele and the irrelevant RNC.  Many congressional Republicans and governors no longer trust Mr. Steele as their spokesman.  They tend to work around the RNC rather than engage Mr. Steele."" Are you irrelevant?"
299,"MR. STEELE:  No, I'm not irrelevant.  And, and God bless Fred Barnes.  If he'd only called me and talked to me, I would have shared with him some very interesting information.  It's easy to write that without knowledge, and clearly he is without knowledge here because the fact of the matter is, number one, yeah, we have been outraised in recently, recently by the Democrats because they have the White House, the Congress, and the Senate.  We don't. But yet, in 2009 we, we outraised the Democrats in like seven out of 11 months where we took in more than they did.  We're keeping pace with the Democrats right now.  But the bottom line is this, and I, and I really appreciate the question because I said from the very beginning, I would be a different kind of chairman because this is a different time for us, for our party.  I wanted us to play on all 50 states.  I wanted us to be out in the communities.  I wanted a grassroots, bottom-up party that was focused on what the people want out there.  And so we've put in place around this country a network now that you're going to see unleashed on November 2..."
300,"MR. GREGORY:  So, so you'll run for re-election?"
301,"MR. STEELE:  ...that's going to contribute to the win.  So--I don't know if--we'll worry about my re-election after I get through this re-election. But let me just share with you this point, that we have smashed the records in fundraising for, for a party out of power, not having those, those White House, Congress and Senate.  We have raised to date over $175 million in this cycle, which is 34 percent more than the Democrats did in a very similar cycle in 2006.  And, and, and furthermore, we have also, just to be clear about this, exceeded the amount that was raised by the D--by the RNC in 1994 in, in, in today's dollars.  So we have kept pace.  And we have 360 victory centers around the country.  We have made 35 million voter contacts since January this year because of the work that the RNC has done early.  We spent the money early, we didn't stockpile the money, David, as the old RNCs would do..."
302,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
303,MR. STEELE:  ...so that they could have a good cash on hand at the end of the month.  We wanted the money in the states.  That's where it is.  And come November 2 you're going to see the effect of that planning.
304,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, Chairman Steele, we will leave it there.  Thank you very much, as always."
305,"MR. STEELE:  You got it, friend.  Take care."
306,"MR. GREGORY:  And up next, a look at all the very latest polls and all the big races, the 2010 landscape as we head into the final week of campaigning. Can Democrats turn out their voters?  What role will the tea party play?  Our roundtable puts it all into perspective:  David Brooks of The New York Times, E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post, former Democratic Congressman Harold Ford Jr., MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, and CNBC's Rick Santelli."
307,                               (Announcements)
308,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up, will Election Day 2010 bring a GOP wave to Washington?  Our roundtable breaks down the biggest races across the country and the keys to the final stretch of the campaign, after this brief commercial break."
309,                               (Announcements)
310,"MR. GREGORY:  We are back, and we want to go through some of the latest polls that are out just this week in some of the most high-profile Senate races, and I want to start with seats currently held by Democrats.  In California, this is breaking information coming from the LA Times, longtime senator Barbara Boxer, she's now at 50 percent in this new LA Times poll over the Republican challenger, Carly Fiorina, at 42 percent.  It looked like it was a race that was tightening.  Boxer at 50 percent, that's a big deal."
311,"And in Colorado, a new poll out also this morning from The Denver Post.  You saw them debate right here last Sunday, the race between Democratic Senator Michael Bennet, Republican Ken Buck.  It is now a dead heat, 47-47."
312,"The open seat in Connecticut, Chris Dodd retiring there.  An example here of Democrats coming home a bit, state attorney general Dick Blumenthal leading in the polls against former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Republican Linda McMahon.  He's up at 57 percent over 39 percent, a widening spread there."
313,"President Obama's Senate seat in Illinois, the candidates both debated here. Well, that race between Republican Congressman Mark Kirk and the Democrat Alexi Giannoulias, a poll out this week, 43 percent for Mark Kirk.  He's got a slight edge over Giannoulias.  The president certainly a benefactor in that race."
314,"The open seat in Pennsylvania, where Democratic Congressman Joe Sestak has managed to surprise a lot of observers, tightened this race against the Republican former Congressman Pat Toomey.  Two new polls.  One has Sestak with an edge, 44-41.  On the left here shows Toomey with an edge at 48, 46 percent. All eyes on Philadelphia and turnout there.  That's going to matter."
315,"To Wisconsin, three-term Democratic Senator Russ Feingold, in an unexpectedly tough race and ride, in danger of losing his seat to the Republican Ron Johnson.  And here's the latest.  It's Johnson with the edge, 49-to-47 percent."
316,"And some recent polling in Republican-held seats now.  The contest in Alaska, this has been a wild one.  Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, she's waging a write-in campaign against the tea party candidate Joe Miller.  He defeated her, of course, in the Republican primary.  Well, the two of them in a dead heat at 37 percent.  You have the Democrat Scott McAdams at 23 percent."
317,"And in Florida, another three-way contest.  Republican nominee Marco Rubio leading independent Governor Charlie Crist and Democratic nominee Congressman Kendrick Meek.  Rubio at 41 percent, Crist at 26, Kendrick Meek at 20 percent."
318,"And then finally Kentucky.  A Republican open seat, tea party candidate Rand Paul is locked in a close and an increasingly nasty race against state attorney general Jack Conway.  New poll out this morning indicating Rand Paul at 48 percent, a five-point spread over Jack Conway."
319,"So those are some of the latest polls.  Let's talk, overall, about the landscape, and I'll do it with my roundtable here, as I make my way over to them.  Joining me to break it all down, E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post, The New York Times' David Brooks, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, CNBC's Rick Santelli, and former Democratic Congressman, author of ""More Davids than Goliaths:  A Politic Education,"" Harold Ford Jr."
320,"Welcome to all of you.  That was a mouthful, I have to say."
321,"FMR. REP. HAROLD FORD JR.  (D-TN):  Nice walk, by the way."
322,"MR. GREGORY:  As we look through the polls--thank you very much.  Thank you. I made it over there safely, which is, which is important to know."
323,"David Brooks, again, a snapshot of where we are, what's the big picture landscape of what's going on here?"
324,"MR. DAVID BROOKS:  There's sort of two big pictures.  The first one is if you ask generically on the national level, Republicans still doing quite well, huge leads among independents.  They've got a 59-31 percent lead.  So nationally, if you look at those numbers, Republicans still actually building momentum.  In these individual Senate races, you're seeing a bit of a mixed picture, a lot of tightening.  I think, I'm a little dubious about that LA Times poll which showed Fiorina so far down."
325,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
326,"MR. BROOKS:  I think is you average them, she's like down 2 percent.  but generally you see tightening in most--in both races in opposite directions. So Pennsylvania got a lot more tight in the Democratic direction.  Illinois moving a little Republican.  But, basically, I think you have a situation where it's candidate-driven, people are disgusted by the candidates in both parties, and they're--so they're basically flipping a coin."
327,"MR. GREGORY:  And Rachel Maddow, you look at the, the national overhang here, President Obama's approval rating, we had a new poll out this week.  He's still upside down, disapproval at 49 percent to approval 47 percent.  If you listen to the White House and talking to advisers there this week, they say, ""Look, there's a possibility of something that's more of a split decision."" Senate states with the Democrats.  You heard Michael Steele say the House is going to go to Republicans, in his view.  And some key governors races showing some tightening and some good news for Democrats.  What do we see?"
328,"MS. RACHEL MADDOW:  I think that the initial diagnosis that Democrats don't care and were going to be--weren't going to be able to turn out, that they weren't going to be able to get off their hands and actually get out to the polls this year has turned out to be a little bit of--a little bit wrong. We're seeing the high Democratic numbers in terms of early voting, for example.  But, you know, it was less than two years ago that this country turned out and elected Barack Obama by seven points, by 10 million votes, and it was--for the second straight election, elected a hugely greater number of Democrats to Congress and the Senate than they did Republicans, and that was less than two years ago.  I don't think the country has changed that much. We, at that time, in 2008, saw people screaming about the president's birth certificate and imagining everybody was a Muslim and fainting at the sight of Sarah Palin.  I mean, those people existed in 2008, as well, but they lost. And so I think that the narrative has been very exciting on the Republican side, but I don't think the country has changed as much since 2008 as the narrative would suggest."
329,"MR. GREGORY:  Rick Santelli, the president has been out there campaigning, campaigning hard, and he's made some, some statements that have certainly gotten people's backs up certainly on the right, and this was one of them. Campaigning in Boston, he said this at a fundraising dinner:  ""Part of the reason that our politics seems so tough right now, and facts and science and argument does not seem to be winning the day all the time, is because we're hard-wired not to always think clearly when we are scared.  And the country is scared, and they have good reason to be."" Is that's what's driving a lot of this mood?"
330,"MR. RICK SANTELLI:  I don't the president appears that fearful, actually.  I think that comment's a little overrated with regard to the politicians being afraid.  I think, if you look at the fear factor, the anomaly was that the last election cycle there was fear.  There was fear over the credit crisis. There was fear over the big hiccup in globalization.  I think that there is a certain amount of level-headed thinking that's coming in, back into the electorate, and I think they're going to vote out the incumbents.  So I think the fear cycle was the last election.  I think the fear cycle at this point is in the politicians that are trying to hold on to what was the anomaly of a changing regime in the '08 cycle."
331,"MR. GREGORY:  E.J. and, and Harold, both, what about the messaging from the president and Democrats?  Bill Clinton has been all over the country, he's got another 22 stops planned in the last nine days, E.J.  There's been reporting that he's been baffled that there isn't a tighter message on the Democratic side about jobs, jobs, jobs.  The president's talked about Boehner and Karl Rove, and now he's talking about, you know, clear thinking not winning out. Is this a right way to campaign?"
332,"MR. E.J. DIONNE:  I think a lot of Democrats out there are struck by the fact that there was not a clear overriding message from the beginning, whereas the Republicans have had this list.  And it doesn't really answer any problems, but they talk about debt, taxes, unemployment and the like.  The candidates I've seen out there that are actually coming up--I think Joe Sestak in Pennsylvania's a good example, I was up there yesterday--are the ones saying, ""Yes, I voted for the stimulus, and here's why, and here's the good it did.  Yes, I voted for health care, and here's why, and here's what good it did."" And I think that Democrats would be better served sort of embracing what they've done, explaining it, and even bragging about it a little bit.  But on the overall race, I, I walked into a Sestak headquarters in Harrisburg, and this lovely man at a call center was making calls for Sestak and he said, ""Look, we Democrats are procrastinators.  We engage late."" And I think the best hope Democrats have for closing these gaps is that that gentleman is right there, that procrastination will turn into engagement at the very end. And that's the fight right now."
333,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, but, Harold, you know, the big driver of the big change elections--2006, 1994--is whether people think the country's headed in the right direction or the wrong direction.  This is what it was for October 20--2006 and October 1994, people feeling the country's on the wrong track, 61 percent and 55 percent respectively in terms of being on the wrong track. Where are we today?  Our new polling out this week, October of 2010, 59 percent of Americans think the country's off on the wrong track.  Very difficult."
334,"REP. FORD:  The question is--there's no doubt, and that number doesn't bode well.  The question is whether or not people believe Republicans can lead us in a different and better direction.  I think the president--there's a lot to be said about what they didn't have and how they could have had a tighter message, and I'm in that camp.  Yet, I think one of the things he's been able to achieve is to get out and remind Democrats why they elected him, what he represents, and that he's still president, and that he needs the help of some Democrats, not tea partiers, not those way outside of the mainstream on the Republican side."
335,"Now, the bigger question is, what happens after this election?  Assume Democrats hold narrow majorities in both, and there's a chance we absolutely could.  The likelihood is we won't, but the chance is we could.  I think the president and Democrats are going to have to take a very, very different approach than they have up to this point.  They're going to have to be willing for more reconciliation with the other side.  They're going to have to be more focused on growth and jobs, and there might even have to be some admissions about mistakes that were made.  Because one thing is clear:  Even if we hold, the approach has not been the right approach over the last two years.  The goals have been laudable and the right ones, but the approach certainly deserves some tinkering, if not major reshaping."
336,"MR. GREGORY:  Look, let me dig in on some issues here.  This debate about outside money, David, I just asked Chairman Steele about it, and he seemed to be dismissive of this as a problem, as a real factor in the race, says he's for transparency but doesn't see a problem that you've had such big donations coming from outside groups where we don't know where they're coming from and who they are.  Mike Isikoff, who I referenced in that interview, has done some reporting on this, and he talked to us about some of what his reporting shows him.  Take a look."
337,(Videotape)
338,"MR. MIKE ISIKOFF:  Not since the days of Watergate have we seen special interest money pouring into political campaigns with no transparency, no disclosure about where the money is coming from.  You've got groups being set up around the country with names that voters have never heard of bombarding the airwaves with campaign ads.  And I think what this is doing is confusing voters more than enlightening them because they have no idea who's behind these ads or what the agenda is of the people who are running them."
339,(End videotape)
340,"MR. GREGORY:  Yet, you wrote, David, this week, you don't think this is a big deal.  You think this is more hype than real."
341,"MR. BROOKS:  I think it's tremendously corrupting in Washington.  The question is, does it affect the electorate?"
342,MR. GREGORY:  Hm.
343,"MR. BROOKS:  And I guess, does it affect voters?  A couple things.  First, it's important to remember the outside money is only 10 percent of the total money.  Most, most money is still candidates-driven and it's party-driven. The second thing is the money is flowing in on both sides.  AFSCME, the public sector worker, $87 million; the NEA, $40 million.  So there's a ton of money. Though that is..."
344,MR. GREGORY:  But you do know where they're coming from.
345,"MR. BROOKS:  Right.  That's, that's exactly right.  The untransparent money is a genuine problem.  But then this third thing, and the final thing, is does it affect voters?  We've got $3.5 billion being spent on this election.  Some of these outside funds like Karl Rove's American Crossroads, they're spending $12 million.  Do we really think that's affecting?  And then if you've got a race like in Colorado, where the Democrat and the Republican are each throwing 5,000 ads at each other, do we really think if one candidate throws 7,000 as opposed to 5,000, it's going to make a big difference?  I really don't think so."
346,"MR. GREGORY:  E.J., you do."
347,"MR. DIONNE:  Yeah, I think it makes--first of all, Karl Rove's group is spending a lot more than $12 million, by their own account.  There's a lot more money coming in."
348,MR. BROOKS:  Maybe a quarter of what AFSCME is.
349,MR. DIONNE:  In total...
350,"MS. MADDOW:  That's not true, actually."
351,"MR. DIONNE:  ...these secret conservative groups are going to spend about $200, $220 million according to the current estimates.  The money matters. And secret money is corrupting, secret money is dangerous, secret money, as Mike Isikoff said, leads to scandal.  And the Watergate--we forget that a lot of, of--a big piece of the Watergate scandal was secret money.  And to say this money doesn't matter is to say that Karl Rove, who really cares a lot about politics, is wasting his time trying to raise all this money; Ed Gillespie, who knows a lot about politics, is wasting his time.  And for voters--you know, people will know about this money.  The congressmen are going to know who helped them get elected.  The only people kept in the dark are the voters.  This is a huge deal, and it's historic and it's dangerous."
352,MS. MADDOW:  Yeah.
353,"MR. GREGORY:  Rachel, go."
354,"MS. MADDOW:  I mean, the, the Rove money--I mean, I, I don't know where you're getting the $12 million money--number."
355,MR. BROOKS:  That's from the Center for Responsive Politics.
356,"MS. MADDOW:  They're bragging on raising and spending $52 million.  They said that was their initial goal, and now they say they're going to blow past that and spend significantly more.  So the numbers--we fight over the numbers.  One of the issues, though, is that they're not disclosed.  Seventy-two percent of people in the last NBC/Wall Street Journal poll said it concerns them that they do not know who is funding these political ads.  And I think part of the issue is not just that there's these big PACs, but it's the individual people. The, the owner of the Chicago Cubs could legally contribute $2,400 to Sharron Angle, who's his chosen candidate."
357,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
358,"MS. MADDOW:  He doesn't live in Nevada, that's his--but he's spending $600,000 personally for Sharron Angle in Nevada.  That is of concern."
359,"MR. GREGORY:  But here, but here's the issue.  But, but, Rick Santelli, the--part of the issue here is that this is the law of the land, OK?  Now, is there the political will, and Democrats are in control, to actually change the law?  Because Michael Steele was right, this is the law.  You want to change all of this, Democrats and Republicans have to agree to change the law because this is what the Supreme Court has passed."
360,"MS. MADDOW:  Democrats tried, Republicans blocked it."
361,"MR. SANTELLI:  You know, the pendulum of money swings both ways, and depending on the year, the state of the incumbency, the outcome of the elections, different sides cry foul louder than other sides.  But, in the end, there is a process.  I personally think money in politics on any level is horrible.  I'd like to see a set amount and have every candidate spend it. Have it be completely transparent.  But actually getting to that spot, as we have learned through all the legislation over the decades, is very difficult. But, yes, whether it's the Supreme Court or some of these issues regarding transparency, there is a process.  I am a firm believer in process."
362,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, well, I'm going to--we're going to take a break here.  Harold's going to start us off in the next segment, we're going to talk about some of the, the key issues going on in some of these races, as well as the controversy over Juan Williams.  More from our roundtable after this brief station break.  Don't go away."
363,                               (Announcements)
364,"MR. GREGORY:  We're back with more of our political roundtable, where the conversation hasn't stopped even during the break.  I want to talk inside some of these races, some other trends, the vulnerability and the strength of the tea party in this race."
365,"Rick Santelli, of--everyone knows, of course, you are, though you're, you're a mild-mannered man, but you are the father of the tea party, as you sit there. Look at some of the impact, the Delaware Senate race, Chris Coons, Christine O'Donnell, she was supported by the tea party, Sarah Palin--by the way, this is not a close race.  She's way behind.  You wouldn't know that by all the attention it's getting.  And some of her statements in the course of this campaign, beyond having to say that she was not a witch in a campaign ad, she's gotten a lot of attention for.  This debate about the First Amendment, whether she understood really what was in the First Amendment, separation of church and state.  Does she hurt the Republican brand as someone who a lot of people feel is not qualified to be a Senator?"
366,"MR. SANTELLI:  I think that there's been a lot of people in Congress that didn't know all the ins and outs of the Constitution.  I think we have a whole roomful of people that have record legislation in terms of quantity of pages that didn't read it.  Who am I to say or, or put words in the mouth of the electorate in Delaware?  I think that the tea party movement is terrific. It's created discourse that might not have otherwise occurred.  It's happened in breakneck speed against all odds.  Neither of the medias, left or right, I think, really were very happy that they showed up on the doorstep.  And as far as O'Donnell, you know, she's a lot more normal, less elite, and I think she's going to make mistakes.  Whether she has or not, is not for me to say, but the tea party's going to be--the movement's going to be messy..."
367,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Harold..."
368,MR. SANTELLI:  ...because you're bringing in outsiders.
369,"MR. GREGORY:  Harold, if you look at the impact she may have had on the Pennsylvania race, if you're sitting in Philadelphia, you watch TV from Delaware, and do--are there a lot of Democrats, independents who say, ""If that's the Republican brand this year, maybe I want to go with a Sestak""?"
370,"REP. FORD:  If Christine O'Donnell had answered the question like Rick Santelli did when asked about separation of church and state or other things she may not know about and say, ""Look, I don't know the full answer to that. Let me tell you why I'm running."" She almost celebrated the fact that she didn't know it and even went further and suggested that what clearly is in the Constitution is not in the Constitution."
371,"Look, at the end of the day, the fact that she won that primary, I thought Michael Steele's answer was a pretty good one on it when asked whether or not she was qualified.  Voters in Delaware, like a lot of voters around the country, saying, ""If the guys in Washington are so smart today, how come we're in the mess we're in today?  Maybe we ought to send some people there that are not as smart or not as smart as people in Washington may think."""
372,"Now, I happen to think Christine O'Donnell is just--is not qualified for a number of other reasons.  I disagree with her on a number of fronts, and I think Chris Coons has done a phenomenal job at pointing out where she's weak. The big issue for Democrats heading into this last week or so, I think is what President Clinton has tried to say and what President Obama is trying to do, which is, ""Look at where we've come.  Look at the mess we've gotten out of. We've got a long way to go, give us two more years here, and if we don't get this right, then you have the right to remove us from, from power.  Until then, give us a chance to stay on path, because if you push us the other way, we're going to go back to the mess that got us into this problem that we're facing today."""
373,"MR. GREGORY:  Look at, Rachel, look at what's happening in Nevada, where you've got Harry Reid, the majority leader, Sharron Angle, a tea party candidate, who didn't appear to be in this race, she's come back.  Both are really disliked in this race, quite frankly..."
374,MS. MADDOW:  Mm-hmm.
375,"MR. GREGORY:  ...and yet it's a close race.  She's running an ad that is reminiscent of what was done to Majority Leader Tom Daschle, you know, really capturing that anti-establishment sentiment out there.  This is an ad she's running against Reid."
376,"(Videotape, political ad)"
377,Narrator:  Harry lives at the Ritz-Carlton while thousands are losing their homes.  The nation needs a new direction and Nevada needs jobs.  Say no to Harry Reid.
378,(End videotape)
379,"MS. MADDOW:  Say no to Harry Reid because of where he lives is remarkable.  I mean, the Sharron Angle campaign, I think, is instructive.  Once the Republican establishment got over their discomfort with her winning that primary, the money has just poured, poured, poured into that race.  She also ran an ad in that race that I think is the most overtly racist ad of this campaign season, showing a group of white college students being menaced by some tough looking Latinos.  The Sharron Angle race, I think, is, is, is important--it's the highest profile race in the country--because for a lot of Democrats, there is no national message.  That's absolutely true.  Democrats decided they didn't want a national message.  But in almost every race, the Democratic message to get out the base is three words, ""Google my opponent."" Look at this guy I'm running against.  Sharron Angle says conservatives should be expected to use guns to try to get what they want if they don't get what they want from the election, the Second Amendment remedies thing; wants people--a woman who's raped and gets pregnant as the result of rape, to be forced to bear that child.  To be able to say, ""Lookit, you may not like me, but look what you're being asked to choose instead of me,"" is the most powerful message a lot of Democrats have to share."
380,MR. GREGORY:  Can I just add...
381,REP. FORD:  Here's the problem.
382,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
383,"REP. FORD:  A week away, Sharron Angle was thought to be so far out of this race, people have characterized her views as so far out of the mainstream.  At the end of the day, the only thing on voters? minds is--are jobs and the economy.  What would help in the last week..."
384,MR. SANTELLI:  Google the unemployment rate.
385,"REP. FORD:  Right.  Exactly.  What would help at the end of the, at the end of this last week, in addition to Obama and Clinton who--Clinton, I think, has a great message on this, is to talk about what we're going to do to create jobs.  Stay away from attacking these guys personally, stay away from talking about foreign money."
386,MR. SANTELLI:  Yeah...
387,"REP. FORD:  Money is in politics, it's been there.  I was in politics for 10 years, I had some of the worst ads run against me ever.  I had some of the most money spent by a guy in my state running against me.  That's not the issue.  The issue is getting out and making the case for what we're going to do to create jobs and to make the economic situation for individual families better."
388,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, to that point..."
389,MR. BROOKS:  (Unintelligible)
390,"MR. GREGORY:  Hold on, David Brooks.  To that point, Fortune magazine, I think, has an interesting piece about how difficult it is for the government really to move something on the economy, and here's a portion, I'll put it up on the screen.  And this is really something for Republicans to deal with. ""The latest tax-cut screed, the Republican party's Pledge to America, is economically incoherent.  It has no meaningful numbers, proposes no changes in programs like Social Security, Medicare, and defense, and asks no sacrifices of anyone, yet says it can balance the budget.  Good luck with that."" Where are the sacrifices that Republicans are asking voters to make to put them back into power, if they're in power?"
391,"MR. BROOKS:  They're not.  I mean, I mean, to talk--first on the issues..."
392,"MR. GREGORY:  And a question for Democrats, too, by the way."
393,"MR. BROOKS:  Right.  I mean, it might be offensive to talk about the issues, but the reason the Democrats are in a mess here is that, first, the economy's bad; second, their, their--the policies are unpopular.  Health care has like 38 percent approval.  So, but going back to those core issues, voters are not insane, they're going to vote on those core issues.  The problem is that the country--and I think the polls are pretty clear about this--the country right now is not willing to make the sacrifices the way the British people are that is necessary to get us back in some sort of fiscal situation that's stable. We know it has to be done.  We have to means tests entitlements, that means take away some of the middle class tax subsidies.  We have to raise taxes.  We probably need to raise taxes on consumption.  We're going to probably have to repeal all of the Bush tax cuts, the middle class and the rich, at some point. That's what has to be done.  The American people sort of don't accept that yet, and the polls show that.  And, as a result, neither party is willing to face that."
394,"MR. GREGORY:  E.J. Dionne, I have to switch quickly because we only have a couple of minutes left in this segment.  Something that you wanted to talk about and has been a big issue this week, Juan Williams being fired as analyst at NPR.  The Republicans, you heard Michael Steele talk about it, they're making it a campaign issue saying NPR's money should be cut.  Did NPR do the wrong thing here?"
395,"MR. DIONNE:  See, I think there are two issues here.  The first issue is, NPR is quite simply one of the best news organizations in the world, and anybody who thinks that they are liberal biased, I challenge them to do what a student of mine once did at Georgetown, take a week of transcripts, take a month of transcripts and examine it for political bias.  You're not going to find it. Fox News, on the other hand, is a Republican propaganda network that put into circulation the false idea that Obama went to--President Obama went to a madrassa, and they stoked the tea party.  They stoked, not the tea party movement, but the death panels.  That's on the one side.  On the other side, I think NPR made a mistake in the way they handled this.  I was a member of a union for a long time.  I think employees, contract employees included, deserve some respect.  What they should've said is sat Juan Williams down, he's done a lot of good work for them, and say, ""Look, you have a choice here. Look at the context you were on with O'Reilly.  You could barely get your points out in the middle of the propaganda.  Do you want to work for Fox, that's OK, but--or you want to work for us, that's OK.  But you've got to decide,"" if I may use Fox's slogan.  They should have handled it that way. But this should not be used to run a smear campaign against NPR."
396,"MR. GREGORY:  Rick, does this belong in the campaign?"
397,"MR. SANTELLI:  I think that a company can make any choice from a management-employee standpoint that they wish.  I think the one issue I see in here is the funding from the federal government.  It's not an issue to me.  I think the funding could be an issue, but it's not going to alter the election results in any way.  I think what Mr. Brooks is talking about is the issue austerity.  We need leadership.  You don't sell belt-tightening in fancy commercials.  You don't knock your opponent.  What you need to do is you need to tell America that you can get behind us, we'll do the right thing, it's going to be a bit painful.  The reason Americans aren't buying into it is because they don't trust Congress, and that's the whole epicenter of this election.  Maybe we can put some people we trust in.  And maybe they're not going to fit the normal mold.  That's a good thing.  And maybe if we trust them, we'll actually pay higher taxes, and we won't feel bad about it because the outcome will be a better country and we won't be saying, ""Opa!"" in five years."
398,"MR. GREGORY:  Rachel, I, I--address the Juan Williams issue, too.  I want to get your views on that."
399,"MS. MADDOW:  On the Juan Williams issue, I think it may be an election issue if Jim DeMint leads the Republicans on this, and the Republicans, like they did with Newt Gingrich in power, decide that they're going to go after Big Bird and they're going to try to make public--they're going to go after him like they went after the NEA and wage culture war again.  On this issue that the American people just need to be told that belt tightening is the right thing, we just need the right politicians, it makes a lot of sense here at MEET THE PRESS.  But in the real world, when you talk about the real politicians and what they're actually putting out there..."
400,MR. SANTELLI:  Because we haven't had any leaders that can sell the idea.
401,"MS. MADDOW:  ...the, the prototypical tea party fiscal conservative candidate, right, is probably Marco Rubio.  Marco Rubio's economic plan right now is to add $3.5 trillion to the deficit.  That's what he's proposing.  And he's, he's being marketed as the fiscal conservative outsider to do that."
402,"MR. BROOKS:  Well, we should mention Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, is actually doing it..."
403,MR. SANTELLI:  Exactly.
404,MR. BROOKS:  ...and his approval rating has gone up.
405,REP. FORD:  And Ed Rendell...
406,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.  Go ahead.
407,"REP. FORD:  ...the governor of Pennsylvania.  And no, I'll answer succinctly, no, NPR should not have fired Juan Williams."
408,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
409,"REP. FORD:  If they were going to do it, they should have did it like, like E.J. said."
410,"MR. DIONNE:  Should I just say, David and I argue politics on NPR all the time.  So I should disclose that.  And I would note, I'm a liberal.  I'm always countered by David or somebody more conservative than David."
411,REP. FORD:  Is that possible?
412,MR. DIONNE:  Thank God it is.
413,"MR. GREGORY:  We're going to leave it there for just a moment, but we're going to come back.  We're going to get some Election Day predictions here from the roundtable on the keys to the last couple of weeks.  Don't go away. We have one more commercial break."
414,                               (Announcements)
415,MR. GREGORY:  We're back.  Just a couple of minutes left.
416,"Harold, what do you see on Election Day?"
417,"REP. FORD:  I think Democrats can hold both the House and the Senate very narrowly if, in this last week, it's all about the economy and jobs and the president promises to push the reset button with Republicans and particularly with the business community."
418,"MR. GREGORY:  You're not ready, you're not ready to pronounce the House is gone?"
419,REP. FORD:  No.  No.
420,MR. GREGORY:  Rick Santelli.
421,MR. SANTELLI:  I think we're going to send a record number of incumbents to Disney World on November 3.
422,"MR. GREGORY:  Rachel, break it down.  Does the House go?"
423,"MS. MADDOW:  I don't know.  I'm on--I'm a bad predictor, I have to say.  I think that it's going to be closer than people think.  I do not think it's going to be a Republican landslide, but I do think we're going to get a lot more red.  I do also think that Christine O'Donnell's new show on Fox is going to be awesome."
424,MR. GREGORY:  You'll be a viewer.
425,MS. MADDOW:  Yeah.
426,"MR. BROOKS:  Democrats actually go to the Vineyard, not Disney World, when they lose, so I'm guessing it'll be, it's a guess, 52 seats the Republicans pick up, but not as many in the Senate as they think."
427,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  So they, you think Democrats hold on to the Senate."
428,MR. BROOKS:  Yeah.
429,"MR. GREGORY:  And, and some of those key governorships, the White House looking at California, looking at Florida, looking at Ohio, saying that'd be good for 2012."
430,"MR. BROOKS:  Yeah.  Ohio is probably Republican, California probably Democratic, but nobody knows who's going to show up.  That's the big mystery."
431,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.  What do you see, E.J.?"
432,"MR. DIONNE:  Right now Republicans would take the House, the Democrats would hold the Senate.  But if the far right in the Republican Party wakes Democrats up and they find a coherent economic message, I still think they have a chance of holding on to both, narrowly."
433,"MR. GREGORY:  The, the--Sarah Palin was out this week and saying, ""We can see 2012 from my house,"" a play on her slipup from 2008.  Harold, what is the relationship between this midterm race and Barack Obama's run for re-election in 2012?"
434,"REP. FORD:  Again, I think after the race, the president's got to push the resent button on a number of fronts.  If he does not do that, if we think by holding narrow majorities that we've won somehow or another in this election, we've completely misread the public.  They want answers on the debt, they want answers on taxes, and most importantly want answers on growth.  If we don't answer that, then it's going to be a--it's going to be a worse year for, in 2012.  But he's a smart guy, and the White House is even smarter."
435,"MR. GREGORY:  Ten seconds, Rachel."
436,"MS. MADDOW:  I think that the Goldwaterization of the Republican Party is a, is a possibility.  If they do very, very well in these elections, I think that we're seeing a very Jesse Helms culture war kind of vibe from Republican candidates, and that may push the 2012 candidates way to the right in the Republican..."
437,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We have...
438,REP. FORD:  Chris Christie is not that way.  He's formidable.  He's not a culture war guy.
439,MR. GREGORY:  That's true.  All right.  We're going to leave it there.  Thank you all very much.
440,"Before we go, a few quick programming notes.  Watch MSNBC tomorrow night at 9 PM Eastern for the documentary ""The Assassination of Dr. Tiller,"" reported by Rachel Maddow.  Also this Tuesday evening, I'll be moderating a debate between the three candidates vying to become the next U.S. senator from Florida. Viewers in Florida can tune in at 7 PM to their local NBC affiliate.  The rest of us can watch, around the country, can watch live on WESH, weshtv.com.  And that's how you can see it."
441,"That is all for today.  We'll be back next week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

With the president's handling of the

From 
NBC News

Washington

MEET THE PRESS
 with 
David Gregory
.
"
14,"
MR. GREGORY:
But first this morning, breaking news over the weekend as authorities in 
Yemen
 arrest a 
young woman
 there on suspicion of mailing explosives concealed inside cargo 
packages
 destined for 
Chicago
-area synagogues, bombs powerful enough, according to 
U.S.
 officials, to take down airplanes. The president calling this plot a credible threat as investigators continue to search for more suspects inside 
Yemen
, and officials here are looking closely at the suspected involvement of 
al-Qaeda
's Yemeni branch, 
AQAP
, 
al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
. Here with us this morning with the very latest, the president's counterterrorism chief deputy, National Security Adviser 
John Brennan
. Welcome back to 
MEET THE PRESS
.
"
15,"
MR. JOHN BRENNAN:
Thank you, 
David
.
"
16,"
MR. GREGORY:
What more is known about the plot this morning?
"
17,"
MR. BRENNAN:
Well, we're still working very closely with 
British authorities
, 
Emirati
 authorities, as well as the 
Yemenis
 and other services. We're trying to get a better handle on exactly what might else be out there. That's why we've taken exceptionally prudent measures, in my mind, as far as preventing 
packages
 coming into the 
United States
 from 
Yemen
. The Yemeni authorities have been very cooperative in this effort, as have other governments and services. So we're still trying to understand better exactly what we might be facing.
"
18,"
MR. GREGORY:
Is it your fear that there are additional devices out there, additional bombs out there in the mail somewhere?
"
19,"
MR. BRENNAN:
I think we have to presume that there might be, and therefore we have to take these measures. But right now we do not have, you know, indications that there are others that are out there. In fact, 
FedEx
 and 
UPS
 have stopped all the 
packages
 that are coming into the 
United States
 that were being mailed from 
Yemen
. So I think we feel as though the appropriate steps have been taken, so we feel good about where we are right now. But we need to continue to do this investigation and get to the bottom of it.
"
20,"
MR. GREGORY:
So additional active threats right now, is it, is it anything beyond the prospect of additional 
packages
?
"
21,"
MR. BRENNAN:
Well, 
al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
 has been quite vocal in terms of threatening attacks against the 
United States
, against Western interests, against the 
Yemenis
. They are a determined group, they are a dangerous group. We are determined to stop their plans and to thwart their attempts, so we need to keep the pressure on them.
"
22,"
MR. GREGORY:
And this is 
al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
 in 
Yemen
 that is behind this, in your mind? A reminder, of course, this was the same group that tried to launch the 
Christmas Day plot
 as well.
"
23,"
MR. BRENNAN:
It certainly bears the hallmarks of 
al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
. And since these 
packages
 originated from 
Yemen
, that is who I'm looking at very closely.
"
24,"
MR. GREGORY:
Who is -- who or what was the ultimate 
target
, in your mind?
"
25,"
MR. BRENNAN:
Well, the British have come out and Prime Minister 
Cameron
's came out and said that they -- he believes that the intention was to detonate this 
IED
 on the plane. But the, the terrorist wouldn't have known where that plane was going to be. It was a viable device, it was self-contained, so it could have been detonated and activated. It was addressed to some locations in 
Chicago
 that have been associated with synagogues. So, therefore, what we're trying to do is determine whether or not the 
target
 was the aircraft itself or the ultimate destination.
"
26,"
MR. GREGORY:
So was it passengers? Did they try to get this on passenger planes? Or were they trying to exploit the 
cargo system
?
"
27,"
MR. BRENNAN:
I don't know exactly the extent of their knowledge of how these cargo 
packages
 are moved and whether or not they're on 
cargo aircraft
 or 
passenger aircraft
. We just know that there was an intention to try to carry out some type of attack with these 
IEDs
 that were going to be transshipped on aircraft to the 
United States
.
"
28,"
MR. GREGORY:
My understanding is that the bomb maker behind this is sophisticated, somebody that you may think you know. I mean, this was not an amateur hour.
"
29,"
MR. BRENNAN:
No, it's a very sophisticated device in terms of how it was constructed, how it was concealed. We know that 
al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
 has carried out similar types of attempts in the past. 
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab
, the 
Detroit
 bomber 
Christmas Day
 last year, as well as the attempt against Saudi Prince 
Mohammed
bin Nayef
, they bear very similar types of traits and characteristics. The bomb maker in 
Yemen
 who is putting these together is a very dangerous individual that we need to find and bring to justice.
"
30,"
MR. GREGORY:
And are the 
Yemenis
 seeking him out as we speak?
"
31,"
MR. BRENNAN:
Yes, we are, and we're doing it very aggressively.
"
32,"
MR. GREGORY:
What about the exploitation of cargo and that screening? Is this an area that is vulnerable?
"
33,"
MR. BRENNAN:
Well, this is something that the 
United States
 has taken very seriously, particularly since 9/11, making sure that we're able to understand the cargo that's coming into the 
United States
, apply different types of measures, security measures, screening, trying to identify high-threat cargo that is given a particular attention and scrutiny. So we are working very closely with our partners. A lot of 
packages
 that are mailed from overseas will have several transshipment 
points
 en route, so we have to work very closely with those partners.
"
34,"
MR. GREGORY:
Finally, the evolution of 
al-Qaeda
. You look at a branch like this, these are small bore attacks. There seems to be an attitude of, ""Hey, pull off what you can pull off here one at a time, one hit at a time, one person at a time. Send 
packages
, if you can do that."" You know, an individual can try to take down a plane. What does this say about how the, the group is evolving?
"
35,"
MR. BRENNAN:
I think they still are at war with us, and we are very much at war with them. And so they're going to try to identify vulnerabilities that might exist in the system. They continue to go after aviation targets. We need to stay one step ahead of them. We've been very fortunate that we've been able to thwart some of these attacks, again, working very closely with our partners overseas. So we feel as though this is something that we need to maintain our vigilance every day for the foreseeable future.
"
36,"
MR. GREGORY:
Mr. 
Brennan
, 
thank you very much
.

MR. BRENNAN:

Election Day
 just 
48 hours

Philadelphia
, 
Connecticut
 and 
Chicago

election
 the stakes are high.

PRES. OBAMA:
Unless each and every one of you turn out and get your friends to turn out and get your families to turn out, then we could fall short, and all the 
progress
 that we've made over the last couple years can be rolled back.
"
41,"

"

MR. GREGORY:
Joining me now, two men trying to lead their respective parties to victory Tuesday, the chairman of the 
Democratic National Committee
, former 
Virginia
 Governor 
Tim Kaine
; and the current chair of the Republican Governor's 
Association
, former 
RNC
 chair, Governor 
Haley Barbour
 of 
Mississippi
. Welcome, both of you. Here we go.
"
43,"
FMR. GOV. TIM KAINE (D-VA):
Great 
to be with you
, 
David
.
"
44,"
MR. GREGORY:
We are on the eve of the 
election
. Governor 
Barbour
, let me start with you. Is that what 
Americans
 should expect? You heard the president say there a rollback of Democratic accomplishments, a rollback of the 
Obama
agenda
.
"
45,"
GOV. HALEY BARBOUR (R-MS):
Well, there's no question that this 
midterm election
 is a referendum on 
Obama
's 
policies
. He talks about it, the public talks about it. The dominant issues in 
America
 are all of this spending, outrageous spending, sense of debt, skyrocketing deficits, joblessness. And what the 
American people
 are looking at and they're saying, ""The 
Obama
policies
 aren't working. They -- we need new 
policies
. We need a, we need an economic growth 
agenda
."" So it's very clearly a referendum...
"
46,"
MR. GREGORY:
But are they voting for rollback? Are they voting for a rollback and a repudiation?
"
47,"
GOV. BARBOUR:
They're voting to, they're voting to -- they will vote, in my opinion, to repudiate these 
policies
. If 
Republicans
 win, that's what it will be, a repudiation of 
Obama
's 
policies
.
"
48,"
MR. GREGORY:
Governor 
Kaine
, are we looking at a realignment here politically in 
Washington
, or something of a split decision on Tuesday?
"
49,"
GOV. KAINE:
Well, 
David
, I think the 
Republicans
 are saying they're going to take both houses. We believe we're going to hold onto both houses. And we're going to see. I'm not going to predict. I, I, I believe that we'll hold onto both houses. But the margins'll get narrower because the American public isn't a 59-41 
nation
. The margins will get narrower. I think this is a choice, a clear choice, not a referendum. It's a choice between a 
Democratic Party
 that is doing heavy lifting to turn a shrinking 
economy
 that the 
Republicans
 left us into a growing 
economy
, stopping combat operations on 
Iraq
, and so many other key achievements. And what you have on the 
Republican side
 was crystallized by Senator 
McConnell
 this week. He was asked, what is the number one Republican priority if you take over either 
house
? He didn't talk about jobs, didn't talk about deficits. He said, ""We want 
President Obama
 to be a one-term president."" They have a 
political
 and partisan 
agenda
, which they've had from day one. We're the problem solvers trying to get this 
nation
 going after a 
lost decade
 that they've created.
"
50,"
MR. GREGORY:
Governor 
Barbour
, do you see realignment? Do you, you see the 
House
 going -- most 
political
 analysts believe the 
Republicans
 retake the 
House
.
"
51,"
GOV. BARBOUR:
Well, what I see is that we've just gone through, in the last nearly two years, the biggest lurch to the left in American 
political history
. And if you mean a realignment, the 
American people
 want to yank 
America
 back away from that, yeah, they do. Do I see a realignment in the sense of that one party is going to win some 
total control
? No, I don't. I think 
Tim
 is right, that we're a 
center
-right 
nation
. 
And I
 think that this 
election
 will push us back toward the 
center
. But it's because people know that the 
Obama-Pelosi-Reid
policies
 have been 
far left
.
"
52,"
MR. GREGORY:

House
 vs. 
Senate
, what goes Republican?
"
53,"
GOV. BARBOUR:
Well, I -- I'll be surprised if the 
House
 doesn't have a Republican 
majority
. I think it's harder in the 
Senate
. I think 
Republicans
'll make big gains in the 
Senate
. And, of course, for my particular line of work, I think we'll have at least 30 Republican governors.
"
54,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right. A reminder it's 39 needed in the 
House
, 10 in the 
Senate
 for Republican 
control
. 
Let's talk
 about some of the issues, Governor 
Kaine
, 
health care
, for one. You said this week that 
Democrats
 would be nuts if they try to create distance between themselves and the 
Democratic Party
 generally.
"
55,"
GOV. KAINE:
Actually...
"
56,"
MR. GREGORY:
Democratic leaders and 
President Obama
. In fact, back in March on this program, I had asked you what would be the fallout from passing 
health care
, and this is what you said.
"
57,"

"
58,"
MR. GREGORY:
Governor, at what cost will victory be achieved?
"
59,"
GOV. KAINE:

David
, this is going to be great for 
Democrats
. You know, I've been on a ballot seven times and won seven 
races
. I would love to be running on this. This is going to be a big win for the American public, and every Democrat everywhere will get a tailwind because it will solve the big issue and done it well.
"
60,"
MR. GREGORY:
But, Governor 
Kaine
, you, you...
"
61,"

"
62,"
MR. GREGORY:
You said the 
Democrats
 would get a tailwind.
"
63,"
GOV. KAINE:
Mm-hmm. 
Mm
-hmm.
"
64,"
MR. GREGORY:

Democrats
 do not agree. They are not running on 
health care
...
"
65,"
GOV. KAINE:
A lot of them are, 
David
.
"
66,"
MR. GREGORY:
...in your -- 
hold on
 -- in your -- a lot of them are not. In your own 
state
...
"
67,"
GOV. KAINE:
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
"
68,"
MR. GREGORY:
...there's only one Democrat in a tight -- toss-up race who's actually defending his healthcare vote. The president was stumping for 
Tom Perriello
.
"
69,"
GOV. KAINE:
Gerry Connolly.
"
70,"
MR. GREGORY:
Is he actually defending his vote?
"
71,"
GOV. KAINE:
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
"
72,"
MR. GREGORY:
In those toss-up 
races
 around the 
country
, they are not actually standing up for 
health care
.
"
73,"
GOV. KAINE:

David
...
"
74,"
MR. GREGORY:
They don't see it as a tailwind.
"
75,"
GOV. KAINE:

David
, I've been in 40-plus 
states
 as 
DNC
 chair, and you can pick out 
Democrats
 who are, who are not running on 
health care
. But the overwhelming 
majority
 of candidates that I'm standing up with, they're proud of the party, proud of the president, proud of the accomplishments.
"
76,"
MR. GREGORY:

Mm
-hmm.
"
77,"
GOV. KAINE:
And they're thrilled that they have reformed a 
healthcare system
 to stop insurance company abuses, make sure that 
young people
 can stay on family 
policies
 until age 26, help seniors and help 
small business
. So, sure, if somebody stands up, a Democrat, and says they're against it, that's going to be newsworthy. But all the 
Democrats
 who are out there campaigning for it, that's not so newsworthy, but I can assure you...
"
78,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right. Governor, you're sitting here saying...
"
79,"
GOV. KAINE:
...the overwhelming 
majority
...
"
80,"
MR. GREGORY:
...that there are a 
majority
 of 
Democrats
 around the 
country
 who are actually campaigning...
"
81,"
GOV. KAINE:
Absolutely.
"
82,"
MR. GREGORY:
...on their healthcare vote.
"
83,"
GOV. KAINE:
And the last poll I saw, 
The New York Times
 poll, had a 49-41 we would, we would approve 
health care
 rather than we would want to roll it back or change it. And that's only going to get stronger as we go along.
"
84,"
MR. GREGORY:
Actually the polling shows that most are against it. But 52 percent say...
"
85,"
GOV. KAINE:
Well, not this is the most...
"
86,"
MR. GREGORY:
...that they -- that you should give it a chance to, to work.
"
87,"
GOV. BARBOUR:
Look, 
Democrats
 are running from 
Barack Obama
 on 
healthcare reform
 like scalded dogs. I mean, he comes to the 
state of Texas
...
"
88,"
GOV. KAINE:
That's not why he's getting 35,000 folks at rallies.
"
89,"
GOV. BARBOUR:
...he comes to -- he comes to the 
state of Texas
 and the Democratic governor for 
Texas
 goes all the 
way across
Texas
 to get 
somewhere else
. The same thing in 
Georgia
. Has a fundraiser for the Democratic candidate for governor of 
Florida
 and they won't let the press in.
"
90,"
GOV. KAINE:
Well, 
David
, you've seen the rallies, too. The president has done, I guess, 10 to 12 rallies with now 250,000 people. I'm going to 
Cleveland
 later today, showing up for this president. And that's what we're seeing all across the 
country
. Despite Republican's assertions, ""Oh, there's an enthusiasm gap,"" we're seeing strong Democratic performance in 
early voting
 and we're seeing significant turnout all over the 
country
. And then the field efforts are kicking in, and we're seeing polls -- the poll today that I saw shows that if you just ask registered, 
Democrats
 have an edge over Republican this time. Likelies, they still have an edge by about 4 
points
. 
That's what
 we've got to do between now and Tuesday.
"
91,"
MR. GREGORY:
Governor...
"
92,"
GOV. KAINE:
If our voters turn out we win.
"
93,"
MR. GREGORY:
Governor 
Barbour
, let me ask you about what happens after 
Election Day
.
"
94,"
You have a Republican Party that's making pretty rash promises:
a repeal of 
health care
, a promise to cut $100 billion out of 
government spending
 without being specific in this contract with 
America
, this promise to 
America
, and a blueprint for how to govern that doesn't talk about 
Social Security
 or 
Medicare
. How are they really going to lead?
"
95,"
GOV. BARBOUR:
Well, I can tell you how Republican governors are going to lead. In my 
state
, we're spending this year 13.3 percent less in 
state
 appropriations than two years ago. Same thing in 
Tim
's 
state
. In 
Tim
's 
state
...
"
96,"
GOV. KAINE:
Yeah, I was spending less than when I started.
"
97,"
GOV. BARBOUR:
...they're spending more than 10 percent less. The 
federal government
 is going to have to learn that you can spend less money and provide the services that the 
country
 needs. So the first thing I think 
Republicans
 are going to do is make sure that we cut spending, and that's going to be a very serious thing, and it's got to be done. Whether it's $100 billion...
"
98,"
MR. GREGORY:
But we don't have specifics.
"
99,"
GOV. BARBOUR:
But what is $100 billion? It's three percent.
"
100,"
MR. GREGORY:
They don't say the way they're going to do it.
"
101,"
GOV. BARBOUR:
It's, it's 3 percent of the 
federal budget
.
"
102,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
103,"
GOV. BARBOUR:
I've cut my 
budget
 13 percent, so it can be done. More importantly, it's got to be done. We've saddled -- in the 
Obama
administration
, first three budgets more than $4 trillion of new debt that we're putting on our children and grandchildren.
"
104,"
MR. GREGORY:
Can 
Republicans
 really pull off a repeal of 
health care
? You think that's what the 
country
 wants?
"
105,"
GOV. BARBOUR:
I think if they don't fully repeal it and replace it, they will make such big changes in it over the next three years that you won't recognize it.
"
106,"
MR. GREGORY:
And, and, Governor, the president talks about building some consensus with 
Republicans
.
"
107,"
GOV. KAINE:
Right. Mm-hmm.
"
108,"
MR. GREGORY:
Where will that consensus come? Will it be harder after Tuesday? Will we see more gridlock, not less?
"
109,"
GOV. KAINE:
Well, well, 
David
, it can't be harder because the 
Republicans
 decided from the day this president was sworn in they weren't going to cooperate with him on anything. If these margins narrow, the 
Republicans
 will be forced to govern. So, for example, on the deficit issue, let's talk about that. The president went to 
Congress
 last year in the 
State of the Union
 and said, ""Join me in a bipartisan deficit commission to get 
control
 of 
federal
 spending."" 
The Republicans
 in the 
Senate
 blocked that bill, they wouldn't vote for it. They voted against it even though they were sponsors. Thank goodness the president has, by executive order, appointed a deficit commission that's going to report out soon. You know, we're going to put the 
Republicans
 to their word and see if they are willing to reject what they did in the 
Bush administration
 and actually get serious about spending and deficits.
"
110,"
MR. GREGORY:
See that, Governor 
Barbour
, you talked about the 
tea party
. You told the 
National Journal
 that they're basically part of the 
Republican Party
 and they'll be OK with 
Republicans
 if they get their shot in the batters box. What's that going to look like if you get these 
tea party
 candidates coming in to 
Congress
?
"
111,"
GOV. BARBOUR:
I think the 
tea party
 voters, Republican voters, most independents in the 
United States
, they're concerned about outrageous spending, skyrocketing debt, deficits, and they way that it has not produced jobs. So what I think we're going to -- you're going to see 
Republicans
 do that's going to be joined in, we're going to attack spending. Spending is the problem. We're not going to raise taxes when we're trying to recover from a recession, and there's certainly no recovery going on on 
Main Street
. They may think it is in some economist's office, but on 
Main Street
 we, we need an economic growth plan and it sure can't have big tax increases in it.
"
112,"
MR. GREGORY:
With 30 seconds left I want to ask you what 
2010
 means to 
2012
. Do you think the president faces a 
challenge
 from the left, left a 
primary challenge
 in 
2012
?
"
113,"
GOV. KAINE:
I don't. No, I think the president has got solid support among 
Democrats
 that I see, because, look, they understand. We were in a loss decade. We've taken a shrinking 
economy
 and turned it into a growing one, stopped combat operations in 
Iraq
, 
equal pay for women
, saved the auto industry. The president is going to be the Democratic nominee in 
2012
, and we feel like the 
progress
 that he's been able to achieve is going to put him in very, very good shape.
"
114,"
MR. GREGORY:
Governor 
Barbour
, you said you'd wait till the end of the year to judge the mood about your own potential run for the presidency. Will you 
challenge
 the president in 
2012
?
"
115,"
GOV. BARBOUR:
We were going to decide after 
November 2
, but I was thinking about the president having a 
challenge
 from the left. Who is there to the left of him?
"
116,"
MR. GREGORY:
But you haven't decided about a run for the presidency?
"
117,"
GOV. BARBOUR:
I haven't given it any thought. After this 
election
's over, we'll sit down and see if there's anything to think about.
"
118,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, we're going to leave it there. Thanks to you both. Up next, the 
final countdown
 to 
Decision
2010
, all the latest polls, 
Election Day
 projections,

political analysis from our roundtable:

"
121,"
MR. GREGORY:
Coming up, we break down the very latest polls from Tuesday's biggest 
races
. Plus, 
Election Day
 projections and 
political analysis
 from our expanded roundtable. It's right after this brief 
commercial break
.
"
122,"

"
123,"
MR. GREGORY:
We are back. We want to look through some of the latest polls out this week in some of the most high profile 
races
. And let's start with those 
Senate
seats
 currently held by the 
Democrats
. 
Key
, of course, for 
Republicans
 to win if they're going to pick up 10 needed to 
control
 the 
Senate
. Ten is the 
magic number
. We start in 
California
, and look at 
Barbara Boxer
. She's widened that lead. She's now at 49-41. It's an 8-point race. 
Fiorina
 was in the hospital a couple days this week. She appears to be losing ground. To 
Colorado
. last week, remember, dead even. This week we see the Republican, 
Ken Buck
, pulling ahead of the Democrat, 
Michael Bennet
, just a bit now. In two of the polls, it's a 4-point race or maybe even tighter than that. 
President Obama
's former 
Senate
 seat in 
Illinois
, very tight race. Still showing Republican Congressman 
Mark Kirk
 a slight edge against 
Alexi Giannoulias
. The president out for 
Giannoulias
 this weekend. A look at the percentages, only 44 percent, they're well below 50 there. To 
Nevada
. No race more significant symbolically, with Majority Leader 
Harry Reid
 in the 
fight
 of his 
political
 career against 
tea party
 candidate 
Sharron Angle
, who, in two polls, has that edge. Four 
points
 for 
Angle
 over 
Reid
. They are still below 50 percent there. The 
open seat
 in 
Pennsylvania
, where Democrat Congressman 
Joe Sestak
 in a tight race against Republican former Congressman 
Pat Toomey
. A new poll out this morning showing again it's 
Toomey
 with the edge, a 2-point lead. Turnout is so important here. 
Washington state
 now, this is the Democratic firewall. Senator 
Patty Murray
 and Republican 
Dino Rossi
 still battling. It's one of the toughest 
races
 this cycle. Two polls this week showing her, 
Murray
, up slightly. She's personally popular. The real enemy there is 
Washington
, and that's what she's up against. To 
Wisconsin
. Three-term Democratic Senator 
Russ Feingold
 slipping away from the Republican 
Ron Johnson
. This is now a 7-point race in 
Johnson
's favor. And some recently polling in the much talked about Republican-held seat of 
Florida
. What a crazy week. This week we mentioned earlier, we'll 
talk about it
 some more, the fact that 
President Clinton
 was trying to get the Democrat, 
Kendrick Meek
, out of the race by suggesting he get out. It is a three-way race. You can see why. It's 
Rubio
, the Republican, at 45 percent, 
Crist
 at 28 percent in the latest poll, and 
Meek
 down to 21 percent. If that support for 
Meek
 went away, what could that mean for the race? He's still in the race, but what about the 
African- American
 turnout? That's a, a real fear now among Democratic professionals. Those are the latest 
numbers
. We want to bring in 
Chuck Todd
, our 
political
 director and our chief White House correspondent, to go inside the 
numbers
 a little bit, 
Chuck
, and let's talk -- we talked about the 
House
 some with our first two guests. Go inside the 
fight
 for the 
Senate
; the 
magic number
 is 10 for the 
Republicans
.
"
124,"
MR. CHUCK TODD:
Well, let's look at the path to 10 here, and we start with the four that 
Republicans
 believe they have in the bank. These are four Democratic-held 
seats
 that look like 
Republicans
 have them, 
North Dakota
, 
Indiana
, 
Arkansas
 and 
Wisconsin
. So the question is, where do they get six more? Let's move along. They believe the Republican wave, these ones in yellow -- you talked about all three 
races
 -- that these ones in yellow, that the Republican wind will get them these three 
seats
, 
Pennsylvania
, 
Illinois
 and 
Colorado
. That gets them to seven. How do they find three more? Well, these are the four toughest hills to climb for the 
Republicans
, these four in red, 
West Virginia
, 
Nevada
, 
California
 and 
Washington
. 
Republicans
 think they're going to get 
Nevada
, but it's a real coin flip as far as turnout's concerned. 
Washington
 is their next best shot. The problem they have is they have to win one of 
West Virginia
 and 
California
. In this week, both Republican candidates have faded.
"
125,"
MR. GREGORY:

Let's talk
 about the 
House
 here. And inside the 
numbers
, the key number is 39.
"
126,"
MR. TODD:
Yes.
"
127,"
MR. GREGORY:
That's what 
Republicans
 need. But you're looking at some additional 
numbers
 that are going to be a real key to 
election night
.
"
128,"
MR. TODD:
I am, because, you know, we talk about the 39 
seats
. But there really is an 
easy way
 to figure out why everybody thinks 
Republicans
 have the 
House
control
 in the bag, and that is the 
number 49
. Forty-nine 
Democrats
 hold districts that 
John McCain
 carried in 
2008
. So, essentially, 
Democrats
 are playing an 
away game
, if you will. These are a lot of 
seats
 that they won in 
2006
 and 
2008
. They're going to get a -- their 
majority
 pretty much basically on these 49 
seats
. In addition, I'm also following the 14 
Democrats
, and there are a few more than these 14, but there are 14 
Democrats
 who are marginal 
seats
, very close, ones that 
Obama
 narrowly carried, who voted for 
health care
, who voted for cap and trade. This is why, when you see these predictions of 50 to 55, they're right here. This is where you get the 
numbers
. Anything above that will tell you that it was an even bigger wave than anticipated.
"
129,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, very interesting. We'll invite you back to join our roundtable. And we want to turn to the rest of our roundtable this morning. Joining me, the 
National Journal
's 
Charlie Cook
 is here; 
Time magazine
's 
Mark Halperin
, author of ""Game Change""; our own 
Tom Brokaw
 of 
NBC News
; and the author of ""
Grace
 of 
Silence
: A Memoir,"" NPR's 
Michele Norris
. Welcome to all of you. We've gone through the 
numbers
. 
Tom Brokaw
, as you look at a little bigger picture, what are voters preparing to say on Tuesday?
"
130,"
MR. TOM BROKAW:
I, I think they're preparing to say that we, we're not happy with anything that's going on in this 
country
, that the recession turns out to be more systemic and deeper than
"
131,"
they were told earlier. I kind of divide the country up this way:
They don't believe anything that they're hearing from the traditional institutions on 
Wall Street
 and in 
Congress
, and they believe everything that they read on the 
Internet
. And that's a prescription for a lot of turmoil, and that's what we're going to see here. There's a real attempt, I think, to try to get the attention of 
Washington
 on the traditional 
political
 establishment to say, ""Hey, we're in charge 
from the ground up
. It's no longer a top-down game."" You've got a 
political
 landscape now of traditional 
Republicans
, traditional 
Democrats
, the populous represented by the 
tea party
, and then the moveable mass of the independents who are really driving these 
elections
 more with every 
election
 cycle.
"
132,"
MR. GREGORY:

Charlie Cook
, you heard Governor 
Kaine
 say, ""Oh, we're still going to hang on to both here."" What's the real math telling you about how it looks?
"
133,"
MR. CHARLIE COOK:
Well, I think we have two different 
elections
 going on. On the 
House
 level, this has become a nationalized, almost parliamentary, 
election
 where the candidates don't matter so much. It's red/blue. I mean, it's, it's really dissolved into almost a straight party vote. But in the 
Senate
, there, there's a separation that's occurred, and maybe it's because of all the money that's in there. But where 
Democrats
 are actually hanging on a lot better in the 
Senate
races
 than in the 
House
races
, where I don't think it's really very plausible that they could get -- that 
Republicans
 could get a 
majority
 in the 
Senate
 right now. But in the 
House
, I think this thing's just going to be explosive.
"
134,"
MR. GREGORY:
You made a -- an interesting point. Talking about the 
Senate
, the tightest 
races
 are in 
states
 that are not particularly hostile to the 
Democrats
.
"
135,"
MR. COOK:
Well, I think, I think 
Chuck
's point was very well taken that it, it is a home turf 
election
 for 
Democrats
 in those last few 
elections
 -- last few 
states
. I mean, 
California
, the president's job 
approval rating
's 53 percent in 
California
. That's 10 
points
 higher than it is in the rest of the 
country
. And 
Washington state
's not a bad 
state
. I think 
Democrats
 are sort of hanging in there. I, I think they'll end up losing 
Pennsylvania
 and 
Illinois
, but boy, those are awfully, awfully close. And then 
Colorado
, that's -- one strategist said they -- that was his nominee for the most likely recount in the 
country
 was 
Colorado
, it's so close.
"
136,"
MR. GREGORY:

Michele Norris
, you've been around the 
country
 talking about your book but also talking to voters. And the mind-set of the voter's so interesting. 
The Economist
magazine
 has a provocative cover this week that features 
Barack Obama
 sort of surrounded here. And the headline is the angry voter. We can put it up on the screen for the audience to see. ""Angry 
America
,"" the angry voter. And yet we've also seen kind of the mosaic of this 
election
 year. You had 
Glenn Beck
 and 
Sarah Palin
 rallying supporters on 
The Mall
. And then yesterday, the, the 
Restore Sanity Tour
 of 
Jon Stewart
 and 
Stephen Colbert
 of the -- of 
Comedy Central
, estimates of 200,000 people, it wasn't an official metric. And 
Jon Stewart
 speaking, not so much as a liberal or a conservative, but kind of, you know, arguing for the middle. Here's part of what he said.
"
137,"

"
138,"
MR. JON STEWART:
We hear every damn day about how fragile our 
country
 is, on the brink of catastrophe, torn by polarizing hate, and how it's a shame that we can't work together to get things done. But the truth is, we do. We work together to get things done every damn day! ...
"
139,"
The only place we don't is here or on 
cable TV
.
"
140,"

"
141,"
MR. GREGORY:

Michele
, on the left or on the right, there's a message of ""We're the ones who can't get it right,"" in the media or in 
Washington
.
"
142,"
MS. MICHELE NORRIS:
Yeah. You know, it was interesting, the, the 
Rally
 to 
Restore Sanity
 or 
Fear
, there are a lot of 
Democrats
 who looked at that and said, ""Boy, you know, if these were voters that might be in our camp, wouldn't it have been interesting if those people we're out canvassing or actually doing something on the weekend before the 
election
?"" But I've been in 20 cities in 
30 days
, and it's an interesting time to be listening to 
Americans
 right now. 
Tom
, you're right, they're angry. They're not just angry at 
Barack Obama
, though, they're angry at everybody in 
Washington
.
"
143,"
MR. BROKAW:

Mm
-hmm.
"
144,"
MS. NORRIS:
This, this word that we throw around in 
Washington
, ""recovery,"" it seems like a mirage out in 
America
. People don't feel like this is something that's temporary. The pinch feels permanent. Even people who have jobs, who are not in foreclosure, they say, ""I'm OK, but you know what, OK is the new great."" And for a lot of voters, that's not good enough. One thing we don't catch here, though, is that there's a certain degree of pragmatism among voters. They -- they're very results-oriented right now. They want someone who's going to go to 
Washington
 and get something done. And part of the frustration is they're hearing candidates that are tearing each other down, and they're not talking enough about what they're actually going to do.
"
145,"
MR. GREGORY:
But, Mark...
"
146,"
MS. NORRIS:
That could swing around to both parties, because even if the 
GOP
 takes over the 
House
, they're going to come in with great expectations. The voters want to see results.
"
147,"
MR. GREGORY:

Mark Halperin
, what does a rally like yesterday say about the mood of the voter that they can attract that kind of crowd?
"
148,"
MR. MARK HALPERIN:
Well, I think it says a lot about the 
star power
 of 
Jon
, 
Jon Stewart
 and 
Stephen Colbert
. I think that 
Michele
's right, that a lot of 
Democrats
 look at that and say, ""This is not rallying us for the 
election
48 hours
 away, it's simply showing that some people on the left are angry at the media, just as some people on, on the right are."" You know, anger and fear are dominant now, and that's propelling what's going to happen on Tuesday. The 
challenge
 is going to be for the president and for the 
Republicans
, ascending and -- in the 
majority
, perhaps, to then take the anger and fear and actually do what the 
election
's supposed to do, absorb the message and actually try to do something about it. It's going to be really tough, and the pressure's going to be, not just on the president, which everybody focuses on, but also on those new Republican leaders.
"
149,"
MR. TODD:
You know, I'll just say this, though. You know, this is two different 
Washington
 environments. If the 
Republicans
control
 the 
Senate
 or if they do not -- or if the 
Democrats
control
 the 
Senate
. Because it almost frees the 
House
 to be more polarizing, potentially, the Republican leadership, if there is no 
Republican Senate
. And then it becomes this odd game of the 
White House
 and the 
Senate
 against the 
House
. And that's just going to -- it -- I -- you know, we don't know yet the tone out of the 
House
 Republicans until we know who controls the 
Senate
. 
And I
 just -- and, and that's going to be, potentially, I think, a problem for the 
White House
. It would be easier if it were a clean break, in an odd way, of being the 
White House
 vs. congressional 
Republicans
. But you're going to have this weird dynamic between the 
Senate
 and the 
House
 before this stuff ever even makes its way to the president.
"
150,"
MR. GREGORY:

Charlie Cook
, I want to stay in kind of inside the 
races
 a little bit in terms of what you're looking for on 
Election Day
. We've talked some about the 
Senate
; I want to talk about the 
House
 and look at a few 
races
 that you'll look on early in the evening to get a sense of magnitude. It's not so much a question in a lot of people's minds that the 
Republicans
 take the 
House
, but it's a question of magnitude. And we'll put it up on the screen. 
Virginia
 5, 
Tom Perriello
, the freshman Democrat, trying to hold off 
Robert Hurt
. 
The House
 race in 
Indiana 2
 is Representative 
Joe Donnelly
, the Democrat, and 
Walorski
 is the Republican there. And 
Kentucky
 6, the Democrat 
Ben Chandler
 trying to hold off 
Andy Barr
. Why do those matter?
"
151,"
MR. COOK:
There's no -- -- excuse me. There's no one -- -- excuse me. There's no one bellwether. You got to look at a basket of them. And those are 
states
 -- it's early, early 
states
. We'll get -- if you see three, four, five of those going Republican, you'll know that they're having a pretty good 
night
. If 
Democrats
 are surviving -- or maybe four or five of them. If you see 
Democrats
 surviving in half of these, then it means it's not going to be such a bad 
night
. But, but we're going to be watching. By 10 o'clock we'll have a really good idea of whether this is sort of a large, grande, or venti 
election
. I mean...
"
152,"
MR. GREGORY:
And, 
Chuck
, you looked at the polling from that 
district
 because the president was just there Friday 
night
.
"
153,"
MR. TODD:
We did. Our, our Republican partnership on the 
NBC
/
Wall Street Journal
 poll, 
Public Opinion Strategies
, did some overnight polling. The president went to 
Virginia
 5, 
Charlottesville
, that 
district
 down there in 
central Virginia
, and they found that the Republican is leading with 45, 
Perriello
's at 42, and the third party candidate is, is at 6. And more people said they were less likely to support 
Perriello
 because the president was there than more likely, so they believe it didn't have a huge effect. But the president was going down there -- and this gets at the odd math of the 
night
 and what's going to make this difficult, because 
Perriello
's one of about a dozen, dozen and a half 
Democrats
 who 
Democrats
 believe can win without 50 percent because of third party, and they're -- a third party conservative challenger. 
Perriello
 is sort of the, the outsized example of this because he actually is advertising on behalf of this conservative candidate. And that's why the president went there, to try to boost up the imprint there.
"
154,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, let's talk 
a little bit more
 about the president. The, the best-selling book ""Game Change,"" 
Mark Halperin
, that you wrote with 
John Heilemann
, you've written a new afterword, and you talk a bit about 
Obama
 -- and, 
Tom
, I'll have you comment on this first. Let
"
155,"
me put a portion of it up on the screen, from the book:
""[
Obama
 has failed] to put forward what
"
156,"
might be called a 'theory of the case':
a sustained, compelling distillation of his vision of the role of 
government
 in -- at this moment in history, the connective tissue between his inspirational rhetoric and concrete policy proposals. ... ""The absence of a theory of the case has persisted since 
Obama
 arrived at the 
White House
. And it has left him a worryingly indistinct figure, even among his supporters with many on the left seeing him as a temporizing, compromising moderate, while many of those in the 
center
 perceive him as having pitched to the left."" Does that sum up how we got here?
"
157,"
MR. BROKAW:
Well, I -- one of the things that you never want to have happen to you in 
American politics
 or in politics anywhere is let the opposition define you. And the 
White House
 was way too slow to the challenges that began to emerge with the 
tea party
 movement and then within the 
Republican Party
 establishment. I hear from Democratic supporters of 
President Obama
 words like he's been too passive; one of them even saying, a very enthusiastic supporter when he got elected, ""The guy comes off as arrogant to me. He doesn't seem to be in touch."" And there was not passion about the two fundamental issues in the 
economy
. The economists and, and 
think tank
 people can say this recession is over, but if you're in danger of losing your 
house
 and you don't have a job, or you think you're going to lose your job, it doesn't get any worse than that. And the 
White House
 was slow to respond to that in a passionate, kind of proactive fashion, and so I think that they lost not just a beat, but a couple of beats going into this.
"
158,"
MR. GREGORY:
And, 
Mark Halperin
, I'm going to invoke 
Jon Stewart
 again because the president appeared on ""
The Daily Show
"" this week. And kind of to 
Tom's
 point, this was one of the exchanges that people thought was a little unsteady by the president.
"
159,"

"
160,"
MR. STEWART:
So you wouldn't, you wouldn't say you'd run this time as a pragmatist. You would not -- it wouldn't be, ""Yes, we can, given certain conditions""...
"
161,"
PRES. OBAMA:
No. No, I, I, I think -- I, I think what I would say is...
"
162,"
MR. STEWART:
Yeah.
"
163,"
PRES. OBAMA:
...yes, we can, but it is not -- but it is not going to...
"
164,"
MR. STEWART:
Yeah.
"
165,"
PRES. OBAMA:
...it's not going to happen overnight.
"
166,"

"
167,"
MR. GREGORY:
Doesn't sound like the fighter in 
2008
 who says, you know, ""We're not going to stop trying. We're going to keep fighting, we're really going to change this place.""
"
168,"
MR. HALPERIN:
You hit the exact right word, it's 
fight
. He is not seen as someone who gets up every day fighting for the 
American people
. And what's going to be on the line starting Tuesday 
night
 for him is if he doesn't -- if he's not seen very quickly as fighting for the 
American people
, for jobs and for their future, he's going to not win the 
fight
 to get re-elected or to be a successful second half of this -- have a successful second half of this term.
"
169,"
MS. NORRIS:
You know, there's something else he said that 
night
 in that interview with 
Jon Stewart
. He said there's a lot of things that the 
White House
 has accomplished that 
America
 does not know about...
"
170,"
MR. BROKAW:
Right.
"
171,"
MS. NORRIS:
...which was also a damning statement in that he has not made his own case. 
Americans
, in some ways, are adverse to complexity when it comes to politics. They want things that are easy to understand, and the 
White House
 has not always done a good enough job of explaining even their accomplishments that they should be able to stand on.
"
172,"
MR. GREGORY:
And, and, 
Tom
, despite what Governor 
Kaine
 says, there are really precious few 
Democrats
 who are out there campaigning on the president's 
agenda
. I mean, we have looked at this, we've studied this. And there are a fair amount of 
Democrats
 who are saying -- 
Jean Taylor
 in 
Mississippi
, ""I voted, I voted for 
McCain
.""
"
173,"
MR. BROKAW:
Yeah.
"
174,"
MR. GREGORY:
Others saying, ""I'd vote against 
Pelosi
 as speaker."" Others kind of apologizing for their votes.
"
175,"
MR. BROKAW:
Yeah, they're running from him. And the other thing is that if you look at the 
Internet
, where -- which is a game changer in 
American politics
. We have never seen the 
impact
 that it has like it does this year. If you go onto almost -- I was checking the weather in 
Livingstone
, 
Montana
, the other day, and they had a banner about ""This is your 
ticket
 to get rid of a liberal,"" and it was 
Nancy Pelosi
's picture up there. No, a lot of people are 
running away
 from them. And, and, and that has become a part of the, of the texture of this campaign, if you will, is it's a separation from the 
White House
 and what's going on out across the 
country
.
"
176,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, we're going to take a short break here. I want to come back and talk about the message that everyone takes away from Tuesday. 
Republicans
, 
Democrats
, the president, how will 
Washington
 change? More with our roundtable after this brief 
station break
.
"
177,"

"
178,"
MR. GREGORY:
We are back with our roundtable. I want to talk about how 
Washington
 changes after Tuesday. But, 
Michele Norris
, let's talk about the drama in 
Florida
, the three-way race. We learned this week that former 
President Clinton
 actually tried to urge 
Kendrick Meek
, who is 
far behind
, to get out of the race, seemingly to help Governor 
Crist
. This has all blown up because he's saying he's not going to do it. I was moderating the debate down there this week. 
Crist
 had said, ""No, I don't know who I'm going to caucus with. It'll depend."" Now he's even saying he would, he would have caucused with the 
Democrats
. And now 
Clinton
's going back there to try to make up with 
Meek
. What 
impact
 will this have? A lot of 
Democrats
 worry that 
African-American
 voters are not going to turn out in those other key 
races
 like the governor's race.
"
179,"
MS. NORRIS:
There's a worry that it won't just have an 
impact
 in 
Florida
, that it'll have an 
impact
 around the 
country
. 
The Democrats
 have put a lot of effort into trying to bring out 
young
 voters on Tuesday and to try to, to drive up the vote among 
African-Americans
. You talked about the 
impact
 of the 
Internet
, this is a story that has quickly become a 
national
 story beyond 
Florida
 because of the blogosphere. Bloggers were all over this, and even if 
Meek
, you know, didn't step out, the impression is that someone tried to muscle him out of the race, which doesn't set -- sit well with a lot of 
African-Americans
 voters.
"
180,"
MR. GREGORY:
Do you see an 
impact
, 
Charlie
?
"
181,"
MR. COOK:
Oh I don't think so, because I don't think 
Florida
 is, is on the radar screen for people outside of 
Florida
 the way a lot of these other 
races
 are. They're more -- there's a lot more of these that are, that are sort of engaged that -- I think more so.
"
182,"
MR. GREGORY:

Tom Brokaw
, what is the message that 
Republicans
 take away from 
election night
? As we were talking before, they're making some rash promises out there and, you know, even Governor 
Barbour
 wasn't able to fill in the blanks on where they're going to cut $100 billion and, and knowing that that's not going to get anywhere near to dealing with the deficit.
"
183,"
MR. BROKAW:
Well, some of the 
Republicans
 who are already here in 
Washington
 and are not running for re-
election
 are beginning to look askance at some of the people who are coming on their side. They anticipate some internessing warfare going on. 
Jim DeMint
 coming up from 
South Carolina
 is not going to just fall in line behind Senator 
McDonnell
, for example -- 
McConnell
, from, from 
Kentucky
. There have been some very rash promises. 
Michele Bachmann
, the kind of volatile congresswoman from 
Minnesota
, said, ""We'll cut spending by 23 percent and we'll have it -- the 
budget
 balanced. We're going to repeal the healthcare bill."" You're going to go to 30 million 
Americans
 and say, ""we're going to take your card away."" You're going to go to families and say, ""Your 26-year-old no longer can be on your policy""? And 
President Bush
 introduced the prescription drug benefit, which is now over $1 trillion. Are they going to pull that back in an effort to get -- so there are some big promises that are going to be made, they're going to be very hard to achieve. And there are, on the 
Hill
, on the 
Republican side
, there is already a lot of nervousness about how they get their act together and present a unified front.
"
184,"
MR. GREGORY:
And, 
Mark Halperin
, as you write in the book, how does the president 
change the game
 again? Because that's what he needs here. He's going to have a different looking 
Washington
, he's got to do something.
"
185,"
MR. HALPERIN:
He can't be passive, and he can't assume -- people said it's better for him politically if 
Republicans
 take back 
control
 of 
Congress
. He can't assume that will automatically be better for him. He is not focused on his re-
election
 as much as he is focused on getting things done. And getting things done with 
Republicans
 in 
control
 of the 
House
, 
almost certainly
, and having a 
working majority
 in the 
Senate
 is going to be difficult. He cannot just sit back. He has to, not only as you talked about before from, from ""Game Change,"" have a theory of the case, he's also got to think about expanding his circle. He must improve his relationship with the 
business community
 in this 
country
, and he must win back the independent voters who are going to vote in droves for 
Republicans
 on Tuesday.
"
186,"
MR. GREGORY:
You teed me up very nicely. Look at his margin over 
McCain
 among independent voters in 
2008
. He was very well ahead, 52 to 44 percent.
"
187,"
You look at it today, in our most recent poll, Chuck Todd, and he's completely upside down:
40 percent approval, 52 percent disapproval among independent voters. What's the road to recovery?
"
188,"
MR. TODD:
Well, it's going to be -- I think their hope is that this battle over the 
budget
, the first six months, what, what I've had some folks tell me, both in the 
White House
 and on 
Capitol Hill
, is what 
health care
 was in the summer of 
2009
, in the fall of 
2009
, is what the 
budget
fight
 of 
2011
 is going to be. And that is where their 
lines in the sand
 are going to be drawn. And the way the 
White House
 is hoping to look at this -- let's remember, if 
Republicans
 pick up 70 
House
seats
, which is sort of the very top of the ceiling, the Republican 
majority
 in the 
House
 will still be smaller than the current Democratic 
majority
. So what the 
White House
 sees as possible with this 
Republican House
majority
 is that they'll have -- they'll be pressured on two ends of this thing. You have the 
tea party
 guys that are going to pressure and not be falling in line with 
Boehner
 and they're going to want, they're going to want these votes on repealing 
health care
, they're going to want these big-
ticket
 votes. Then you're going to have the guys that realize 
2012
 is coming, and the president's going to be on the 
ticket
, and it's going to be much harder to win some of these 
states
. And they're hoping there are 15 to 25 moderates they'll always be able to potentially peel off, and in these 
budget
 fights, on specifics, on 
Social Security
, on 
Medicare
, on to the healthcare plan. And that's where they think they can start at least talking to independents again.
"
189,"
MR. GREGORY:

Mm
-hmm.
"
190,"
MR. BROKAW:
But you know, 
David
, a Republican, a key figure, kind of on all the traffic patters on the 
Republican side
 on the 
Hill
 said to me, ""You know, if 
Obama
 plays small ball for the next couple of years and let's us just 
fight
 among ourselves, if they have to increase the debt ceiling for example, and members of the 
tea party
 say, ""We're not going along with that,"" and then you get close to a 
government shutdown
, which is -- which undid 
Newt Gingrich
 after '94, you know, then it could work to his advantage. But it's going to take a very skilled 
political
 figure to pull all that off.
"
191,"
MR. GREGORY:
It's also interesting, 
Michele
, that, that, that the prospect here is for a more liberal caucus, actually, in the 
House
, a, a 
Senate
 that's even more difficult to 
control
...
"
192,"
MS. NORRIS:
Right.
"
193,"
MR. GREGORY:
...if it's more sharply divided, and a conservative -- a 
Republican Party
 and caucus that's even more conservative. Look at the 
Bloomberg
 poll that found what it is that 
Americans
 really want. We'll put it up on the screen. Sixteen percent indicated the priority would be to stick to principles, even if it means gridlock; 80 percent said they want 
Democrats
 and 
Republicans
 to get some things done and work together. Is that really possible now?
"
194,"
MS. NORRIS:
Well, it's going to be difficult because many of the moderates on the Democratic side, for instance, find themselves in the 
fight
 of their lives. I mean, this is where the recruiting effort in the last midterms comes back to bite them in that they recruited moderate candidates in Republican-leaning districts who have a very difficult time now. And if they leave, you're right, we're going to wind up with a smaller liberal 
Democratic caucus
 and a much more conservative larger 
Republican caucus
. And that does not lead to this kind of compromise that people seem to want.
"
195,"
MR. HALPERIN:
Candidate -- sorry -- candidate 
Obama
 in 
2008
 agree with that 80 percent and put himself forward as a person uniquely qualified, more qualified than 
Hillary Clinton
 and 
John McCain
, to get the parties to work together. He couldn't do it, and in some cases chose not to do it, with 
Republicans
 in, in the minority. Now that they're in the 
majority
, the conventional wisdom is it will be even harder, that they will have won an 
election
 with 
tea party
 support, they're looking to 
2012
 to beat him. He needs to, to do what is necessary, to 
fight
 for what is necessary to get that done.
"
196,"
MS. NORRIS:
You know, you talked about...
"
197,"
MR. GREGORY:
And, Tom -- yeah, go ahead.
"
198,"
MS. NORRIS:
...you talked about bipartisanship during the 
election
. But one of the things you got out of talking to people at the 
White House
 now is that they, they feel that bipartisanship is overrated. They don't talk about this in the same way that they did.
"
199,"
MR. GREGORY:

Tom
, you, you, you always counsel we got to keep our eye on some of the big issues here. One of the biggest ones that you wrote about in an op-ed in 
The New York Times
 is what's absent from the campaign debate, which is the war in 
Afghanistan
. In December, there's going to be a review. Next July, we're talking about pulling some of our troops out and talking to commanders on the ground. They're seeing some 
progress
, but we're not having this debate.
"
200,"
MR. BROKAW:
No, we're not having this debate. And, by the way, the weekend was a reminder of where we are in the war against Islamic rage, where people can put some detonation devices on 
UPS
 and 
FedEx
packages
 and ship them into this 
country
. We've spent more than $1 trillion on these two wars in 
Iraq
 and in 
Afghanistan
 so far. We've lost thousands of 
young Americans
. So many of them have come back gravely wounded. One percent of the American population is doing 100 percent of the fighting, and that's not only unjust, it's immoral in a way. And it ought to be a dialogue in an, in an 
election
 year of any kind, and especially in a year when the 
country
 says that it's paying attention to what is going on. And so I think that's a big missing component, and nobody is putting it on the table except to say, ""Well, we're going, we're going to support our veterans and support our 
defense budget
.""
"
201,"
MR. GREGORY:
It is interesting, 
Charlie Cook
, that the president has sort of taken off the table the, the issue for 
Republicans
 that somehow he has not done a good job protecting the 
country
. He's -- there's a lot continuity with the 
Bush
 years, and he's ramped up some of our efforts in the 
national security
 area, this is sort of a, a benign issue for him.
"
202,"
MR. COOK:
It is interesting that the area that people suspected would be his weakest -- 
national security
 -- at least as of this moment, isn't so much. And the biggest problem, when we, when we see polling saying that they -- that people think that 
Republicans
 would do a better job creating jobs, jobs for people than 
Democrats
, wow, historically, that's very, very unusual. 
And I
 think right now the 
Democrats
 are paying a price for a focus that wasn't on the 
economy
 for all of last year. When they were doing cap and trade, when they were doing 
health care
, they should have been focused on the 
economy
. But I tell my Republican friends, ""You should consider this an unearned win."" The 
Republican Party
 still has lousy 
numbers
. They are the beneficiaries of this 
election
, not the victors, and that they should not overread a mandate here. People are just more mad at 
Democrats
 than anything else.
"
203,"
MR. GREGORY:
Quick point, 
Chuck
, before a break.
"
204,"
MR. TODD:
On, on 
Afghanistan
, the 
Democratic caucus
 that will be left, you brought this up, is going to be a very liberal caucus, very anti-war caucus. This is going to be a 
political
challenge
 for him like no other. And by the way, a lot of these 
tea party
 conservatives have all talked about ""we don't want to be there forever"" in these debates. Tom's right, it's not in the campaign trail, but it does come up in debates, and I've monitored these 
tea party
 answers. They're all like, ""I don't want to be 
nation
 builders."" There may be a bipartisan 
majority
 on 
Afghanistan
 in 
Congress
...
"
205,"
MR. GREGORY:

Mm
-hmm.
"
206,"
MR. TODD:
...but it may be to start speeding up by the fall.
"
207,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. Got to take another quick break here. When we come back, some final thoughts. 
And I
 want to take up the important question, as well, of what do Tuesday's results mean for 
2012
? We'll be right back.
"
208,"

"
209,"
MR. GREGORY:
Just a couple of finals thoughts here. 
Chuck
, you're thinking about 
2012
 already.
"
210,"
MR. TODD:
Well, I am. Actually, the 
White House
 is thinking a little bit about 
2012
. 
David Plouffe

222,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, 48 hours to go, the final push to Election Day."
223,(Videotape)
224,REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH):  Your government is out of control.  Do you have to accept it?
225,Crowd:  (In unison) No!
226,REP. BOEHNER:  Do you have to take it?
227,Crowd:  (In unison) No!
228,"REP. BOEHNER:  Hell, no, you don't!"
229,(End videotape)
230,(Videotape)
231,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA:  Now, in this election, the other side is betting on amnesia.  They're betting that you forgot who caused this mess in the first place."
232,(End videotape)
233,"MR. GREGORY:  With the president's handling of the economy and distrust of government dominating the debate, will voters sweep Democrats from control of Congress?  And how will Republicans lead if they return to power?  With us exclusively this morning, two men at the center of it all, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, former Virginia
Governor Tim Kaine; and the current chair of the Republican Governor's Association and former RNC chair, Governor Haley Barbour of Mississippi. Kaine and Barbour debate what's at stake this Tuesday. "
234,"Then, the very latest polls, Election Day projections, and political analysis from Tom Brokaw of NBC News, National Journal's Charlie Cook, Time magazine's Mark Halperin, NPR's Michele Norris, and Chuck Todd of NBC News."
235,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
236,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  But first this morning, breaking news over the weekend as authorities in Yemen arrest a young woman there on suspicion of mailing explosives concealed inside cargo packages destined for Chicago-area synagogues.  Bombs powerful enough, according to U.S.
officials, to take down airplanes.  The president calling this plot a credible threat as investigators continue to search for more suspects inside Yemen, and officials here are looking closely at the suspected involvement of al-Qaeda's Yemeni branch, AQAP, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula."
237,"Here with us this morning with the very latest, the president's counterterrorism chief deputy, National Security Adviser John Brennan."
238,Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
239,"MR. JOHN BRENNAN:  Thank you, David."
240,MR. GREGORY:  What more is known about the plot this morning?
241,"MR. BRENNAN:  Well, we're still working very closely with British authorities, Emirati authorities, as well as the Yemenis and other services. We're trying to get a better handle on exactly what might else be out there. That's why we've taken exceptionally prudent measures, in my mind, as far as preventing packages coming into the United States from Yemen.  The Yemeni authorities have been very cooperative in this effort, as have other governments and services.  So we're still trying to understand better exactly what we might be facing."
242,"MR. GREGORY:  Is it your fear that there are additional devices out there, additional bombs out there in the mail somewhere?"
243,"MR. BRENNAN:  I think we have to presume that there might be, and therefore we have to take these measures.  But right now we do not have, you know, indications that there are others that are out there.  In fact, FedEx and UPS have stopped all the packages that are coming into the United States that were being mailed from Yemen.  So I think we feel as
though the appropriate steps have been taken, so we feel good about where we are right now.  But we need to continue to do this investigation and get to the bottom of it."
244,"MR. GREGORY:  So additional active threats right now, is it, is it anything beyond the prospect of additional packages?"
245,"MR. BRENNAN:  Well, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has been quite vocal in terms of threatening attacks against the United States, against Western interests, against the Yemenis.  They are a determined group, they are a dangerous group.  We are determined to stop their plans and to thwart their attempts, so we need to keep the pressure on them."
246,"MR. GREGORY:  And this is al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen that is behind this, in your mind?  A reminder, of course, this was the same group that tried to launch the Christmas Day plot as well."
247,"MR. BRENNAN:  It certainly bears the hallmarks of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  And since these packages originated from Yemen, that is who I'm looking at very closely."
248,"MR. GREGORY:  Who is--who or what was the ultimate target, in your mind?"
249,"MR. BRENNAN:  Well, the British have come out and Prime Minister Cameron's came out and said that they--he believes that the intention was to detonate this IED on the plane.  But the, the terrorist wouldn't have known where that plane was going to be.  It was a viable device, it was
self-contained, so it could have been detonated and activated.  It was addressed to some locations in Chicago that have been associated with synagogues.  So, therefore, what we're trying to do is determine whether or not the target was the aircraft itself or the ultimate destination."
250,MR. GREGORY:  So was it passengers?  Did they try to get this on passenger planes?  Or were they trying to exploit the cargo system? 
251,MR. BRENNAN:  I don't know exactly the extent of their knowledge of how these cargo packages are moved and whether or not they're on cargo aircraft or passenger aircraft.  We just know that there was an intention to try to carry out some type of attack with these IEDs that were going to be transshipped on aircraft to the United States.
252,"MR. GREGORY:  My understanding is that the bomb maker behind this is sophisticated, somebody that you may think you know.  I mean, this was not an amateur hour."
253,"MR. BRENNAN:  No, it's a very sophisticated device in terms of how it was constructed, how it was concealed.  We know that al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has carried out similar types of attempts in the past.  Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Detroit bomber Christmas Day last year, as well as the attempt against Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, they bear very
similar types of traits and characteristics.  The bomb maker in Yemen who is putting these together is a very dangerous individual that we need to find and bring to justice."
254,MR. GREGORY:  And are the Yemenis seeking him out as we speak?
255,"MR. BRENNAN:  Yes, we are, and we're doing it very aggressively."
256,MR. GREGORY:  What about the exploitation of cargo and that screening? Is this an area that is vulnerable?
257,"MR. BRENNAN:  Well, this is something that the United States has taken very seriously, particularly since 9/11, making sure that we're able to understand the cargo that's coming into the United States, apply different types of measures, security measures, screening, trying to
identify high-threat cargo that is given a particular attention and scrutiny.  So we are working very closely with our partners.  A lot of packages that are mailed from overseas will have several transshipment points en route, so we have to work very closely with those partners."
258,"MR. GREGORY:  Finally, the evolution of al-Qaeda.  You look at a branch like this, these are small bore attacks.  There seems to be an attitude of, ""Hey, pull off what you can pull off here one at a time, one hit at a time, one person at a time.  Send packages, if you can do that."" You know, an individual can try to take down a plane.  What does this sayabout how the, the group is evolving? "
259,"MR. BRENNAN:  I think they still are at war with us, and we are very much at war with them.  And so they're going to try to identify vulnerabilities that might exist in the system.  They continue to go after aviation targets.  We need to stay one step ahead of them.  We've
been very fortunate that we've been able to thwart some of these attacks, again, working very closely with our partners overseas.  So we feel as though this is something that we need to maintain our vigilance every day for the foreseeable future."
260,"MR. GREGORY:  Mr. Brennan, thank you very much."
261,"MR. BRENNAN:  Thank you, David."
262,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  And now we turn to Decision 2010.  Election Day just 48 hours away, the president yesterday stumping in Philadelphia, Connecticut and Chicago, arguing that in this election the stakes are high."
263,"(Videotape, October 30, 2010)"
264,"PRES. OBAMA:  Unless each and every one of you turn out and get your friends to turn out and get your families to turn out, then we could fall short, and all the progress that we've made over the last couple years can be rolled back."
265,(End videotape)
266,"MR. GREGORY:  Joining me now, two men trying to lead their respective parties to victory Tuesday, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, former Virginia Governor Tim Kaine; and the current chair of the Republican Governor's Association, former RNC chair, Governor Haley Barbour of Mississippi."
267,"Welcome, both of you.  Here we go."
268,"FMR. GOV. TIM KAINE (D-VA):  Great to be with you, David."
269,MR. GREGORY:  We are on the eve of the election.
270,"Governor Barbour, let me start with you.  Is that what Americans should expect?  You heard the president say there a rollback of Democratic accomplishments, a rollback of the Obama agenda. "
271,"GOV. HALEY BARBOUR (R-MS):  Well, there's no question that this midterm election is a referendum on Obama's policies.  He talks about it, the public talks about it.  The dominant issues in America are all of this spending, outrageous spending excessive debt, skyrocketing deficits, joblessness.  And what the American people are looking at and they're saying, ""The Obama policies aren't working.  They--we need new policies. We need a, we need an economic growth agenda."" So it's very clearly a referendum..."
272,MR. GREGORY:  But are they voting for rollback?  Are they voting for a rollback and a repudiation?
273,"GOV. BARBOUR:  They're voting to, they're voting to--they will vote, in my opinion, to repudiate these policies.  If Republicans win, that's what it will be, a repudiation of Obama's policies."
274,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor Kaine, are we looking at a realignment here politically in Washington, or something of a split decision on Tuesday? "
275,"GOV. KAINE:  Well, David, I think the Republicans are saying they're going to take both houses.  We believe we're going to hold onto both houses.  And we're going to see.  I'm not going to predict.  I, I, I believe that we'll hold onto both houses.  But the margins will get
narrower because the American public isn't a 59-41 nation.  The margins will get narrower.  I think this is a choice, a clear choice, not a referendum.  It's a choice between a Democratic Party that is doing heavy lifting to turn a shrinking economy that the Republicans left us into a
growing economy, stopping combat operations on Iraq, and so many other key achievements.  And what you have on the Republican side was crystallized by Senator McConnell this week.  He was asked, what is the number one Republican priority if you take over either house?  He didn't talk about jobs, didn't talk about deficits.  He said, ""We want President Obama to be a one-term president."" They have a political and partisan  agenda, which they've had from day one.  We're the problem solvers trying to get this nation going after a lost decade that they've created."
276,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor Barbour, do you see realignment?  Do you, you see the House going--most political analysts believe the Republicans retake the House."
277,"GOV. BARBOUR:  Well, what I see is that we've just gone through, in the last nearly two years, the biggest lurch to the left in American political history. And if you mean a realignment, the American people want to yank America back away from that, yeah, they do.  Do I see a
realignment in the sense of that one party is going to win some total control?  No, I don't.  I think Tim is right, that we're a center-right nation.  And I think that this election will push us back toward the center.  But it's because people know that the Obama-Pelosi-Reid policies
have been far left."
278,"MR. GREGORY:  House vs. Senate, what goes Republican?"
279,"GOV. BARBOUR:  Well, I--I'll be surprised if the House doesn't have a Republican majority.  I think it's harder in the Senate.  I think Republicans will make big gains in the Senate.  And, of course, for my particular line of work, I think we'll have at least 30 Republican
governors."
280,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  A reminder it's 39 needed in the House, 10 in the Senate for Republican control."
281,"Let's talk about some of the issues, Governor Kaine, health care, for one. You said this week that Democrats would be nuts if they try to create distance between themselves and the Democratic Party generally."
282,GOV. KAINE:  Absolutely
283,"MR. GREGORY:  Democratic leaders and President Obama.  In fact, back in March on this program, I had asked you what would be the fallout from passing health care, and this is what you said."
284,"(Videotape, March 21, 2010)"
285,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor, at what cost will victory be achieved?"
286,"GOV. KAINE:  David, this is going to be great for Democrats.  You know, I've been on a ballot seven times and won seven races.  I would love to be running on this.  This is going to be a big win for the American public, and every Democrat everywhere will get a tailwind because it will
solve the big issue and done it well."
287,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Governor Kaine, you, you..."
288,(End videotape)
289,MR. GREGORY:  You said the Democrats would get a tailwind.
290,GOV. KAINE:  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.
291,MR. GREGORY:  Democrats do not agree.  They are not running on health care...
292,"GOV. KAINE:  A lot of them are, David."
293,MR. GREGORY:  ...in your--hold on--in your--a lot of them are not.  In your own state...
294,GOV. KAINE:  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.
295,MR. GREGORY:  ...there's only one Democrat in a tight--toss-up race who's actually defending his healthcare vote.  The president was stumping for Tom Perriello.
296,GOV. KAINE:  Gerry Connolly.
297,MR. GREGORY:  Is he actually defending his vote?
298,"GOV. KAINE:  Yes, absolutely.  Absolutely."
299,"MR. GREGORY:  In those toss-up races around the country, they are not actually standing up for health care."
300,GOV. KAINE:  David...
301,MR. GREGORY:  They don't see it as a tailwind.
302,"GOV. KAINE:  David, I've been in 40-plus states as DNC chair, and you can pick out Democrats who are, who are not running on health care.  But the overwhelming majority of candidates that I'm standing up with, they're proud of the party, proud of the president, proud of the accomplishments."
303,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
304,"GOV. KAINE:  And they're thrilled that they have reformed a healthcare system to stop insurance company abuses, make sure that young people can stay on family policies until age 26, help seniors and help small business.  So, sure, if somebody stands up, a Democrat, and says they're against it, that's going to be newsworthy.  But all the Democrats who are
out there campaigning for it, that's not so newsworthy, but I can assure you..."
305,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  Governor, you're sitting here saying..."
306,GOV. KAINE:  ...the overwhelming majority...
307,MR. GREGORY:  ...that there are a majority of Democrats around the country who are actually campaigning...
308,GOV. KAINE:  Absolutely.
309,MR. GREGORY:  ...on their healthcare vote.
310,"GOV. KAINE:  And the last poll I saw, The New York Times poll, had a
49-41 we would, we would approve health care rather than we would want to
roll it back or change it.  And that's only going to get stronger as we
go along."
311,"MR. GREGORY:  Actually the polling shows that most are against it.  But
52 percent say..."
312,"GOV. KAINE:  Well, not this is the most..."
313,"MR. GREGORY:  ...that they--that you should give it a chance to, to work."
314,"GOV. BARBOUR:  Look, Democrats are running from Barack Obama on
healthcare reform like scalded dogs.  I mean, he comes to the state of
Texas..."
315,"GOV. KAINE:  That's not why he's getting 35,000 folks at rallies."
316,GOV. BARBOUR:  ...he comes to--he comes to the state of Texas and the Democratic governor for Texas goes all the way across Texas to get somewhere else.  The same thing in Georgia.  Has a fundraiser for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida and they won't let the press in.
317,"GOV. KAINE:  Well, David, you've seen the rallies, too.  The president has done, I guess, 10 to 12 rallies with now 250,000 people.  I'm going to Cleveland later today, showing up for this president.  And that's what we're seeing all across the country.  Despite Republican's assertions, ""Oh, there's an enthusiasm gap,"" we're seeing strong Democratic performance in early voting and we're seeing significant turnout all over the country.  And then the field efforts are kicking in, and we're seeing polls--the poll today that I saw shows that if you just ask registereds, Democrats have an edge over Republican this time.  Likelies, they still
have an edge by about 4 points.  That's what we've got to do between now and Tuesday."
318,MR. GREGORY:  Governor...
319,GOV. KAINE:  If our voters turn out we win.
320,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor Barbour, let me ask you about what happens after Election Day.  You have a Republican Party that's making pretty rash promises: a repeal of health care, a promise to cut $100 billion out of government spending without being specific in this contract with America, this promise to America, and a blueprint for how to govern that doesn't talk about Social Security or Medicare.  How are they really going to lead?"
321,"GOV. BARBOUR:  Well, I can tell you how Republican governors are going to lead.  In my state, we're spending this year 13.3 percent less in state appropriations than two years ago.  Same thing in Tim's state.  In Tim's state..."
322,"GOV. KAINE:  Yeah, I was spending less than when I started."
323,"GOV. BARBOUR:  ...they're spending more than 10 percent less.  The federal government is going to have to learn that you can spend less money and provide the services that the country needs.  So the first thing I think Republicans are going to do is make sure that we cut
spending, and that's going to be a very serious thing, and it's got to be done.  Whether it's $100 billion..."
324,MR. GREGORY:  But we don't have specifics.
325,GOV. BARBOUR:  But what is $100 billion?  It's three percent.
326,MR. GREGORY:  They don't say the way they're going to do it.
327,"GOV. BARBOUR:  It's, it's 3 percent of the federal budget."
328,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
329,"GOV. BARBOUR:  I've cut my budget 13 percent, so it can be done.  More importantly, it's got to be done.  We've saddled--in the Obama administration, first three budgets more than $4 trillion of new debt that we're putting on our children and grandchildren."
330,MR. GREGORY:  Can Republicans really pull off a repeal of health care? You think that's what the country wants?
331,"GOV. BARBOUR:  I think if they don't fully repeal it and replace it, they will make such big changes in it over the next three years that you won't recognize it."
332,"MR. GREGORY:  And, and, Governor, the president talks about building some consensus with Republicans."
333,GOV. KAINE:  Right.  Mm-hmm.
334,"MR. GREGORY:  Where will that consensus come?  Will it be harder after Tuesday?  Will we see more gridlock, not less?"
335,"GOV. KAINE:  Well, well, David, it can't be harder because the Republicans decided from the day this president was sworn in they weren't going to cooperate with him on anything.  If these margins narrow, the Republicans will be forced to govern.  So, for example, on the deficit
issue, let's talk about that.  The president went to Congress last year in the State of the Union and said, ""Join me in a bipartisan deficit commission to get control of federal spending."" The Republicans in the Senate blocked that bill, they wouldn't vote for it.  They voted against
it even though they were sponsors.  Thank goodness the president has, by executive order, appointed a deficit commission that's going to report out soon.  You know, we're going to put the Republicans to their word and see if they are willing to reject what they did in the Bush
administration and actually get serious about spending and deficits."
336,"MR. GREGORY:  See that, Governor Barbour, you talked about the tea party. You told the National Journal that they're basically part of the Republican Party and they'll be OK with Republicans if they get their shot in the batters box.  What's that going to look like if you get these tea party candidates coming in to Congress?"
337,"GOV. BARBOUR:  I think the tea party voters, Republican voters, most independents in the United States, they're concerned about outrageous spending, skyrocketing debt, deficits, and they way that it has not produced jobs.  So what I think we're going to--you're going to see
Republicans do that's going to be joined in, we're going to attack spending.  Spending is the problem.  We're not going to raise taxes when we're trying to recover from a recession, and there's certainly no recovery going on on Main Street.  They may think it is at some
economist's office, but on Main Street we, we need an economic growth plan and it sure can't have big tax increases in it. "
338,"MR. GREGORY:  With 30 seconds left I want to ask you what 2010 means to 2012. Do you think the president faces a challenge from the left, left a primary challenge in 2012?"
339,"GOV. KAINE:  I don't.  No, I think the president has got solid support among Democrats that I see, because, look, they understand.  We were in a lost decade.  We've taken a shrinking economy and turned it into a growing one, stopped combat operations in Iraq, equal pay for women, saved the auto industry.  The president is going to be the Democratic
nominee in 2012, and we feel like the progress that he's been able to achieve is going to put him in very, very good shape. "
340,"MR. GREGORY:  Governor Barbour, you said you'd wait till the end of the year to judge the mood about your own potential run for the presidency. Will you challenge the president in 2012? "
341,"GOV. BARBOUR:  We were going to decide after November 2, but I was thinking about the president having a challenge from the left.  Who is there to the left of him?"
342,MR. GREGORY:  But you haven't decided about a run for the presidency?
343,"GOV. BARBOUR:  I haven't given it any thought.  After this election's over, we'll sit down and see if there's anything to think about. "
344,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we're going to leave it there.  Thanks to you both."
345,"Up next, the final countdown to Decision 2010, all the latest polls, Election Day projections, political analysis from our roundtable:  Tom Brokaw of NBC News, National Journal's Charlie Cook, Time magazine's Mark Halperin, NPR's Michele Norris, and Chuck Todd of NBC News."
346,(Announcements)
347,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up, we break down the very latest polls from Tuesday's biggest races.  Plus, Election Day projections and political analysis from our expanded roundtable.  It's right after this brief commercial break."
348,(Announcements)
349,"MR.  DAVID GREGORY:  We are back.  We want to look through some of the latest polls out this week in some of the most high profile races.  And let's start with those Senate seats currently held by the Democrats. Key, of course, for Republicans to win if they're going to pick up 10
needed to control the Senate.  Ten is the magic number.  We start in California, and look at Barbara Boxer.  She's widened that lead.  She's now at 49-41.  It's an 8-point race. Fiorina was in the hospital a couple days this week.  She appears to be losing ground."
350,"To Colorado.  last week, remember, dead even.  This week we see the Republican, Ken Buck, pulling ahead of the Democrat, Michael Bennet, just a bit now.  In two of the polls, it's a 4-point race or maybe even tighter than that."
351,"President Obama's former Senate seat in Illinois, very tight race.  Still showing Republican Congressman Mark Kirk a slight edge against Alexi Giannoulias.  The president out for Giannoulias this weekend.  A look at the percentages, only 44 percent, they're well below 50 there."
352,"To Nevada.  No race more significant symbolically, with Majority Leader Harry Reid in the fight of his political career against tea party candidate Sharron Angle, who, in two polls, has that edge.  Four points for Angle over Reid. They are still below 50 percent there."
353,"The open seat in Pennsylvania, where Democratic Congressman Joe Sestak in a tight race against Republican former Congressman Pat Toomey.  A new poll out this morning showing again it's Toomey with the edge, a 2-point lead. Turnout is so important here."
354,"Washington state now, this is the Democratic firewall.  Senator Patty Murray and Republican Dino Rossi still battling.  It's one of the toughest races this cycle.  Two polls this week showing her, Murray, up slightly.  She's personally popular.  The real enemy there is Washington,
and that's what she's up against."
355,To Wisconsin.  Three-term Democratic Senator Russ Feingold slipping away from the Republican Ron Johnson.  This is now a 7-point race in Johnson's favor.
356,"And some recent polling in the much talked about Republican-held seat of Florida.  What a crazy week.  This week we mentioned earlier, we'll talk about it some more, the fact that President Clinton was trying to get the Democrat, Kendrick Meek, out of the race by suggesting he get out.  It is a three-way race.  You can see why.  It's Rubio, the
Republican, at 45 percent, Crist at 28 percent in the latest poll, and Meek down to 21 percent.  If that support for Meek went away, what could that mean for the race?  He's still in the race, but what about the African-American turnout?  That's a, a real fear now among Democratic professionals."
357,"Those are the latest numbers.  We want to bring in Chuck Todd, our political director and our chief White House correspondent, to go inside the numbers a little bit, Chuck, and let's talk--we talked about the House some with our first two guests.  Go inside the fight for the
Senate; the magic number is 10 for the Republicans."
358,"MR. CHUCK TODD:  Well, let's look at the path to 10 here, and we start with the four that Republicans believe they have in the bank.  These are four Democratic-held seats that look like Republicans have them, North Dakota, Indiana, Arkansas and Wisconsin.  So the question is, where do they get six more?  Let's move along.  They believe the Republican wave,
these ones in yellow--you talked about all three races--that these ones in yellow, that the Republican wind will get them these three seats, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Colorado.  That gets them to seven.  How do they find three more?  Well, these are the four toughest hills to climb
for the Republicans, these four in red, West Virginia, Nevada, California and Washington.  Republicans think they're going to get Nevada, but it's a real coin flip as far as turnout's concerned. Washington is their next best shot.  The problem they have is they have to win one of West Virginia and California.  In this week, both Republican candidates have faded."
359,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk about the House here.  And inside the numbers, the key number is 39."
360,MR. TODD:  Yes.
361,MR. GREGORY:  That's what Republicans need.  But you're looking at some additional numbers that are going to be a real key to election night.
362,"MR. TODD:  I am, because, you know, we talk about the 39 seats.  But there really is an easy way to figure out why everybody thinks Republicans have the House control in the bag, and that is the number 49. Forty-nine Democrats hold districts that John McCain carried in 2008. 
So, essentially, Democrats are playing an away game, if you will.  These are a lot of seats that they won in 2006 and 2008.  They're going to get a--their majority pretty much basically on these 49 seats.  In addition, I'm also following the 14 Democrats, and there are a few more than these 14, but there are 14 Democrats who are marginal seats, very close, ones
that Obama narrowly carried, who voted for health care, who voted for cap and trade.  This is why, when you see these predictions of 50 to 55, they're right here.  This is where you get the numbers.  Anything above that will tell you that it was an even bigger wave than anticipated."
363,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, very interesting.  We'll invite you back to join our roundtable.  And we want to turn to the rest of our roundtable this morning. Joining me, the National Journal's Charlie Cook is here; Time magazine's Mark Halperin, author of ""Game Change""; our own Tom Brokaw of NBC News; and the author of ""Grace of Silence:  A Memoir,"" NPR's Michele Norris.  Welcome to all of you. "
364,"We've gone through the numbers.  Tom Brokaw, as you look at a little bigger picture, what are voters preparing to say on Tuesday?"
365,"MR. TOM BROKAW:  I, I think they're preparing to say that we, we're not happy with anything that's going on in this country, that the recession turns out to be more systemic and deeper than they were told earlier.  I kind of divide the country up this way:  They don't believe anything that they're hearing from the traditional institutions on Wall Street and in
Congress, and they believe everything that they read on the Internet. And that's a prescription for a lot of turmoil, and that's what we're going to see here.  There's a real attempt, I think, to try to get the attention of Washington on the traditional political establishment to
say, ""Hey, we're in charge from the ground up. It's no longer a top-down game."" You've got a political landscape now of traditional Republicans, traditional Democrats, the populists represented by the tea party, and then the moveable mass of the independents who are really driving these elections more with every election cycle."
366,"MR. GREGORY:  Charlie Cook, you heard Governor Kaine say, ""Oh, we're still going to hang on to both here."" What's the real math telling you about how it looks?"
367,"MR. CHARLIE COOK:  Well, I think we have two different elections going on. On the House level, this has become a nationalized, almost parliamentary, election where the candidates don't matter so much.  It's red/blue.  I mean, it's, it's really dissolved into almost a straight
party vote.  But in the Senate, there, there's a separation that's occurred, and maybe it's because of all the money that's in there.  But where Democrats are actually hanging on a lot better in the Senate races than in the House races, where I don't think it's really very plausible
that they could get--that Republicans could get a majority in the Senate right now.  But in the House, I think this thing's just going to be explosive."
368,"MR. GREGORY:  You made a--an interesting point.  Talking about the Senate, the tightest races are in states that are not particularly hostile to the Democrats."
369,"MR. COOK:  Well, I think, I think Chuck's point was very well taken that it, it is a home turf election for Democrats in those last few elections--last few states.  I mean, California, the president's job approval rating's 53 percent in California.  That's 10 points higher than
it is in the rest of the country. And Washington state's not a bad state. I think Democrats are sort of hanging in there.  I, I think they'll end up losing Pennsylvania and Illinois, but boy, those are awfully, awfully close.  And then Colorado, that's--one strategist said they--that was his
nominee for the most likely recount in the country was Colorado, it's so close."
370,"MR. GREGORY:  Michele Norris, you've been around the country talking about your book but also talking to voters.  And the mind-set of the voter is so interesting.  The Economist magazine has a provocative cover this week that features Barack Obama sort of surrounded here.  And the headline is the angry voter.  We can put it up on the screen for the
audience to see.  ""Angry America,"" the angry voter.  And yet we've also seen kind of the mosaic of this election year.  You had Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin rallying supporters on The Mall.  And then yesterday, the, the Restore Sanity Tour of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert of the--of Comedy Central, estimates of 200,000 people, there wasn't an official metric.  And Jon Stewart speaking, not so much as a liberal or a conservative, but kind of, you know, arguing for the middle.  Here's part of what he said."
371,"(Videotape, Yesterday)"
372,"MR. JON STEWART:  We hear every damn day about how fragile our country is, on the brink of catastrophe, torn by polarizing hate, and how it's a shame that we can't work together to get things done.  But the truth is, we do.  We work together to get things done every damn day!  ...  The only place we don't is here (points to Capitol) or on cable TV."
373,(End videotape)
374,"MR. GREGORY:  Michele, on the left or on the right, there's a message of ""We're the ones who can't get it right,"" in the media or in Washington. "
375,"MS. MICHELE NORRIS:  Yeah.  You know, it was interesting, the, the Rally to Restore Sanity or Fear, there are a lot of Democrats who looked at that and said, ""Boy, you know, if these were voters that might be in our camp, wouldn't it have been interesting if those people we're out
canvassing or actually doing something on the weekend before the election?"" But I've been in 20 cities in 30 days, and it's an interesting time to be listening to Americans right now."
376,"Tom, you're right, they're angry.  They're not just angry at Barack Obama, though, they're angry at everybody in Washington. "
377,MR. BROKAW:  Mm-hmm.
378,"MS. NORRIS:  This, this word that we throw around in Washington, ""recovery,"" it seems like a mirage out in America.  People don't feel like this is something that's temporary.  The pinch feels permanent. Even people who have jobs, who are not in foreclosure, they say, ""I'm OK,
but you know what, OK is the new great."" And for a lot of voters, that's not good enough."
379,"One thing we don't catch here, though, is that there's a certain degree of pragmatism among voters.  They--they're very results-oriented right now.  They want someone who's going to go to Washington and get something done.  And part of the frustration is they're hearing candidates that are tearing each other down, and they're not talking enough about what they're actually going to do."
380,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Mark..."
381,"MS. NORRIS:  That could swing around to both parties, because even if the GOP takes over the House, they're going to come in with great expectations.  The voters want to see results."
382,"MR. GREGORY:  Mark Halperin, what does a rally like yesterday say about the mood of the voter that they can attract that kind of crowd?"
383,"MR. MARK HALPERIN:  Well, I think it says a lot about the star power of Jon, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert.  I think that Michele's right, that a lot of Democrats look at that and say, ""This is not rallying us for the election 48 hours away, it's simply showing that some people on the left are angry at the media, just as some people on, on the right are."" You know, anger and fear are dominant now, and that's propelling what's going to happen on Tuesday.  The challenge is going to be for the president and for the Republicans, ascending and--in the majority, perhaps, to then take the anger and fear and actually do what the election's supposed to do, absorb the message and actually try to do something about it.  It's
going to be really tough, and the pressure's going to be, not just on the president, which everybody focuses on, but also on those new Republican leaders."
384,"MR. TODD:  You know, I'll just say this, though.  You know, this is two different Washington environments.  If the Republicans control the Senate or if they do not--or if the Democrats control the Senate.  Because it almost frees the House to be more polarizing, potentially, the Republican leadership, if there is no Republican Senate.  And then it becomes this odd game of the White House and the Senate against the House.  And that's just going to--it--I--you know, we don't know yet the tone out of the House Republicans until we know who controls the Senate.  And I just--and, and that's going to be, potentially, I think, a problem for
the White House.  It would be easier if it were a clean break, in an odd way, of being the White House vs. congressional Republicans.  But you're going to have this weird dynamic between the Senate and the House before this stuff ever even makes its way to the president."
385,"MR. GREGORY:  Charlie Cook, I want to stay in kind of inside the races a little bit in terms of what you're looking for on Election Day.  We've talked some about the Senate; I want to talk about the House and look at a few races that you'll look on early in the evening to get a sense of magnitude.  It's not so much a question in a lot of people's minds that the Republicans take the House, but it's a question of magnitude.  And we'll put it up on the screen.  Virginia 5, Tom Perriello, the freshman Democrat, trying to hold off Robert Hurt.  The House race in Indiana 2 is
Representative Joe Donnelly, the Democrat, and Walorski is the Republican there.  And Kentucky 6, the Democrat Ben Chandler trying to hold off Andy Barr.  Why do those matter?"
386,"MR. COOK:  There's no--(clears throat)--excuse me.  There's no one--(clears throat)--excuse me.  There's no one bellwether.  You got to look at a basket of them.  And those are states--it's early, early states.  We'll get--if you see three, four, five of those going Republican, you'll know that they're having a pretty good night.  If Democrats are surviving--or maybe four or five of them.  If you see Democrats surviving in half of these, then it means it's not going to be
such a bad night.  But, but we're going to be watching.  By 10 o'clock we'll have a really good idea of whether this is sort of a large, grande, or venti election.  I mean..."
387,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Chuck, you looked at the polling from that district because the president was just there Friday night."
388,"MR. TODD:  We did.  Our, our Republican partnership on the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, Public Opinion Strategies, did some overnight polling.  The president went to Virginia 5, Charlottesville, that district down there in central Virginia, and they found that the
Republican is leading with 45, Perriello's at 42, and the third party candidate is, is at 6.  And more people said they were less likely to support Perriello because the president was there than more likely, so they believe it didn't have a huge effect.  But the president was going
down there--and this gets at the odd math of the night and what's going to make this difficult, because Perriello's one of about a dozen, dozen and a half Democrats who Democrats believe can win without 50 percent because of third party, and they're--a third party conservative
challenger. Perriello is sort o the, the outsized example of this because he actually is advertising on behalf of this conservative candidate.  And that's why the president went there, to try to boost up the imprint there."
389,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let's talk a little bit more about the president. The, the best-selling book ""Game Change,"" Mark Halperin, that you wrote with John Heilemann, you've written a new afterword, and you talk a bit about Obama--and, Tom, I'll have you comment on this first.  Let me put a portion of it up on the screen, from the book:  ""[Obama has failed] to put forward what might be called a `theory of the case':  a sustained, compelling distillation of his vision of the role of government in--at this moment in history, the connective tissue between his inspirational rhetoric and concrete policy proposals.  ..."
390,"""The absence of a theory of the case has persisted since Obama arrived at the White House.  And it has left him a worryingly indistinct figure, even among his supporters - with many on the left seeing him as a temporizing, compromising moderate, while many of those in the center
perceive him as having pitched to the left."" Does that sum up how we got here?"
391,"MR. BROKAW:  Well, I--one of the things that you never want to have happen to you in American politics or in politics anywhere is let the opposition define you.  And the White House was way too slow to the challenges that began to emerge with the tea party movement and then within the Republican Party establishment.  I hear from Democratic supporters of President Obama words like he's been too passive; one of them even saying, a very enthusiastic supporter when he got elected, ""The guy comes off as arrogant to me.  He doesn't seem to be in touch."" And there was not passion about the two fundamental issues in the economy. The economists and, and think tank people can say this recession is over,
but if you're in danger of losing your house and you don't have a job, or you think you're going to lose your job, it doesn't get any worse than that.  And the White House was slow to respond to that in a passionate, kind of proactive fashion, and so I think that they lost not just a beat, but a couple of beats going into this."
392,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Mark Halperin, I'm going to invoke Jon Stewart again because the president appeared on ""The Daily Show"" this week.  And kind of to Tom's point, this was one of the exchanges that people thought was a little unsteady by the president."
393,"(Videotape, Wednesday)"
394,"MR. STEWART:  So you wouldn't, you wouldn't say you'd run this time as a pragmatist.  You would not--it wouldn't be, ""Yes, we can, given certain conditions""..."
395,"PRES. OBAMA:  No.  No, I, I, I think--I, I think what I would say is..."
396,MR. STEWART:  Yeah.
397,"PRES. OBAMA:  ...yes, we can, but it is not--but it is not going to..."
398,MR. STEWART:  Yeah.
399,PRES. OBAMA:  ...it's not going to happen overnight.
400,(End videotape)
401,"MR. GREGORY:  Doesn't sound like the fighter in 2008 who says, you know, ""We're not going to stop trying.  We're going to keep fighting, we're really going to change this place."""
402,"MR. HALPERIN:  You hit the exact right word, it's fight.  He is not seen as someone who gets up every day fighting for the American people.  And what's going to be on the line starting Tuesday night for him is if he doesn't--if he's not seen very quickly as fighting for the American
people, for jobs and for their future, he's going to not win the fight to get re-elected or to be a successful second half of this--have a successful second half of this term."
403,"MS. NORRIS:  You know, there's something else he said that night in that interview with Jon Stewart.  He said there's a lot of things that the White House has accomplished that America does not know about..."
404,MR. BROKAW:  Right.
405,"MS. NORRIS:  ...which was also a damning statement in that he has not made his own case.  Americans, in some ways, are adverse to complexity when it comes to politics.  They want things that are easy to understand, and the White House has not always done a good enough job of explaining even their accomplishments that they should be able to stand on."
406,"MR. GREGORY:  And, and, Tom, despite what Governor Kaine says, there are really precious few Democrats who are out there campaigning on the president's agenda.  I mean, we have looked at this, we've studied this. And there are a fair amount of Democrats who are saying--Jean Taylor in Mississippi, ""I voted, I voted for McCain."""
407,MR. BROKAW:  Yeah.
408,"MR. GREGORY:  Others saying, ""I'd vote against Pelosi as speaker."" Others kind of apologizing for their votes."
409,"MR. BROKAW:  Yeah, they're running from him.  And the other thing is that if you look at the Internet, where--which is a game changer in American politics. We have never seen the impact that it has like it does this year.  If you go onto almost--I was checking the weather in Livingstone, Montana, the other day, and they had a banner about ""This is your ticket to get rid of a liberal,"" and it was Nancy Pelosi's picture up there. No, a lot of people are running away from them.  And, and, and that has become a part of the, of the texture of this campaign, if you will, is it's a separation from the White House and what's going on out across the
country."
410,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we're going to take a short break here.  I want to come back and talk about the message that everyone takes away from Tuesday. Republicans, Democrats, the president, how will Washington change?  More with our roundtable after this brief station break."
411,(Announcements)
412,MR. GREGORY:  We are back with our roundtable.  I want to talk about how Washington changes after Tuesday.
413,"But, Michele Norris, let's talk about the drama in Florida, the three-way race.  We learned this week that former President Clinton actually tried to urge Kendrick Meek, who is far behind, to get out of the race, seemingly to help Governor Crist.  This has all blown up because he's
saying he's not going to do it.  I was moderating the debate down there this week.  Crist had said, ""No, I don't know who I'm going to caucus with.  It'll depend."" Now he's even saying he would, he would have caucused with the Democrats.  And now Clinton's going back there to try to make up with Meek.  What impact will this have?  A lot of Democrats worry that African-American voters are not going to turn out in those other key races like the governor's race."
414,"MS. NORRIS:  There's a worry that it won't just have an impact in Florida, that it'll have an impact around the country.  The Democrats have put a lot of effort into trying to bring out young voters on Tuesday and to try to, to drive up the vote among African-Americans.  You talked about the impact of the Internet, this is a story that has quickly become a national story beyond Florida because of the blogosphere.  Black bloggers were all over this, and even if Meek, you know, didn't step out, the impression is that someone tried to muscle him out of the race, which doesn't set--sit well with a lot of African-Americans voters."
415,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you see an impact, Charlie?"
416,"MR. COOK:  Oh I don't think so, because I don't think Florida is, is on the radar screen for people outside of Florida the way a lot of these other races are.  They're more--there's a lot more of these that are, that are sort of engaged that--I think more so."
417,"MR. GREGORY:  Tom Brokaw, what is the message that Republicans take away from election night?  As we were talking before, they're making some rash promises out there and, you know, even Governor Barbour wasn't able to fill in the blanks on where they're going to cut $100 billion and, and knowing that that's not going to get anywhere near to dealing with the
deficit."
418,"MR. BROKAW:  Well, some of the Republicans who are already here in Washington and are not running for re-election are beginning to look askance at some of the people who are coming on their side.  They anticipate some internessing warfare going on.  Jim DeMint coming up from
South Carolina is not going to just fall in line behind Senator McDonnell, for example--McConnell, from, from Kentucky.  There have been some very rash promises.  Michele Bachmann, the kind of volatile congresswoman from Minnesota, said, ""We'll cut spending by 23 percent and we'll have it--the budget balanced.  We're going to repeal the healthcare
bill."" You're going to go to 30 million Americans and say, ""we're going to take your card away."" You're going to go to families and say, ""Your 26-year-old no longer can be on your policy""?  And President Bush introduced the prescription drug benefit, which is now over $1 trillion. Are they going to pull that back in an effort to get--so there are some big promises that are going to be made, they're going to be very hard to achieve.  And there are, on the Hill, on the Republican side, there is already a lot of nervousness about how they get their act together and present a unified front."
419,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Mark Halperin, as you write in the book, how does the president change the game again?  Because that's what he needs here. He's going to have a different looking Washington, he's got to do something."
420,"MR. HALPERIN:  He can't be passive, and he can't assume--people said it's better for him politically if Republicans take back control of Congress. He can't assume that will automatically be better for him.  He is not focused on his re-election as much as he is focused on getting things done.  And getting things done with Republicans in control of the House, almost certainly, and having a working majority in the Senate is going to be difficult.  He cannot just sit back.  He has to, not only as you talked about before from, from ""Game Change,"" have a theory of the case, he's also got to think about expanding his circle.  He must improve his
relationship with the business community in this country, and he must win back the independent voters who are going to vote in droves for Republicans on Tuesday."
421,"MR. GREGORY:  You teed me up very nicely.  Look at his margin over McCain among independent voters in 2008.  He was very well ahead, 52 to 44 percent."
422,"You look at it today, in our most recent poll, Chuck Todd, and he's completely upside down:  40 percent approval, 52 percent disapproval among independent voters.  What's the road to recovery?"
423,"MR. TODD:  Well, it's going to be--I think their hope is that this battle over the budget, the first six months, what, what I've had some folks tell me, both in the White House and on Capitol Hill, is what health care was in the summer of 2009, and the fall of 2009, is what the budget fight of 2011 is going to be.  And that is where their lines in the sand are going to be drawn.  And the way the White House is hoping to look at this--let's remember, if Republicans pick up 70 House seats, which is sort of the very top of the ceiling, the Republican majority in the House will still be smaller than the current Democratic majority.  So what the
White House sees as possible with this Republican House majority is that they'll have--they'll be pressured on two ends of this thing.  You have the tea party guys that are going to pressure and not be falling in line with Boehner and they're going to want, they're going to want these votes on repealing health care, they're going to want these big-ticket votes.
Then you're going to have the guys that realize 2012 is coming, and the president's going to be on the ticket, and it's going to be much harder to win some of these states.  And they're hoping there are 15 to 25 moderates they'll always be able to potentially peel off, and in these
budget fights, on specifics, on Social Security, on Medicare, on to the healthcare plan.  And that's where they think they can start at least talking to independents again."
424,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
425,"MR. BROKAW:  But you know, David, a Republican, a key figure, kind of on all the traffic patters on the Republican side on the Hill said to me, ""You know, if Obama plays small ball for the next couple of years and let's us just fight among ourselves, if they have to increase the debt
ceiling for example, and members of the tea party say, ""We're not going along with that,"" and then you get close to a government shutdown, which is--which undid Newt Gingrich after '94, you know, then it could work to his advantage.  But it's going to take a very skilled political figure to pull all that off."
426,"MR. GREGORY:  It's also interesting, Michele, that, that, that the prospect here is for a more liberal caucus, actually, in the House, a, a Senate that's even more difficult to control..."
427,MS. NORRIS:  Right.
428,"MR. GREGORY:  ...if it's more sharply divided, and a conservative--a Republican Party and caucus that's even more conservative.  Look at the Bloomberg poll that found what it is that Americans really want.  We'll put it up on the screen.  Sixteen percent indicated the priority would be to stick to principles, even if it means gridlock; 80 percent said they want Democrats and Republicans to get some things done and work together. Is that really possible now?"
429,"MS. NORRIS:  Well, it's going to be difficult because many of the moderates on the Democratic side, for instance, find themselves in the fight of their lives.  I mean, this is where the recruiting effort in the last midterms comes back to bite them in that they recruited moderate
candidates in Republican-leaning districts who have a very difficult time now.  And if they leave, you're right, we're going to wind up with a smaller liberal Democratic caucus and a much more conservative larger Republican caucus.  And that does not lead to this kind of compromise that people seem to want."
430,"MR. HALPERIN:  Candidate--sorry--candidate Obama in 2008 agreed with that 80 percent and put himself forward as a person uniquely qualified, more qualified than Hillary Clinton and John McCain, to get the parties to work together.  He couldn't do it, and in some cases chose not to do it, with Republicans in, in the minority.  Now that they're in the majority, the conventional wisdom is it will be even harder, that they will have won an election with tea party support, they're looking to 2012 to beat him.  He needs to, to do what is necessary, to fight for what is necessary to get that done."
431,"MS. NORRIS:  You know, you talked about..."
432,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Tom--yeah, go ahead."
433,"MS. NORRIS:  ...you talked about bipartisanship during the election.  But one of the things you got out of talking to people at the White House now is that they, they feel that bipartisanship is overrated.  They don't talk about this in the same way that they did."
434,"MR. GREGORY:  Tom, you, you, you always counsel we got to keep our eye on some of the big issues here.  One of the biggest ones that you wrote about in an op-ed in The New York Times is what's absent from the campaign debate, which is the war in Afghanistan.  In December, there's going to be a review. Next July, we're talking about pulling some of our troops out and talking to commanders on the ground.  They're seeing some progress, but we're not having this debate."
435,"MR. BROKAW:  No, we're not having this debate.  And, by the way, the weekend was a reminder of where we are in the war against Islamic rage, where people can put some detonation devices on UPS and FedEx packages and ship them into this country.  We've spent more than $1 trillion on these two wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan so far.  We've lost thousands
of young Americans.  So many of them have come back gravely wounded.  One percent of the American population is doing 100 percent of the fighting, and that's not only unjust, it's immoral in a way.  And it ought to be a dialogue in an, in an election year of any kind, and especially in a year when the country says that it's paying attention to what is going on. And so I think that's a big missing component, and nobody is putting it on the table except to say, ""Well, we're going, we're going to support our veterans and support our defense budget."""
436,"MR. GREGORY:  It is interesting, Charlie Cook, that the president has sort of taken off the table the, the issue for Republicans that somehow he has not done a good job protecting the country.  He's--there's a lot continuity with the Bush years, and he's ramped up some of our efforts in the national security area, this is sort of a, a benign issue for him."
437,"MR. COOK:  It is interesting that the area that people suspected would be his weakest--national security--at least as of this moment, isn't so much.  And the biggest problem, when we, when we see polling saying that they--that people think that Republicans would do a better job creating jobs, jobs for people than Democrats, wow, historically, that's very,
very unusual.  And I think right now the Democrats are paying a price for a focus that wasn't on the economy for all of last year.  When they were doing cap and trade, when they were doing health care, they should have been focused on the economy. But I tell my Republican friends, ""You should consider this an unearned win."" The Republican Party still has
lousy numbers.  They are the beneficiaries of this election, not the victors, and that they should not overread a mandate here.  People are just more mad at Democrats than anything else."
438,"MR. GREGORY:  Quick point, Chuck, before a break."
439,"MR. TODD:  On, on Afghanistan, the Democratic caucus that will be left, you brought this up, is going to be a very liberal caucus, very anti-war caucus. This is going to be a political challenge for him like no other. And by the way, a lot of these tea party conservatives have all talked about ""we don't want to be there forever"" in these debates.  Tom's right, it's not in the campaign trail, but it does come up in debates, and I've monitored these tea party answers.  They're all like, ""I don't want to be nation builders."" There may be a bipartisan majority on Afghanistan in Congress..."
440,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
441,MR. TODD:  ...but it may be to start speeding up by the fall.
442,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Got to take another quick break here.  When we come back, some final thoughts.  And I want to take up the important question, as well, of what do Tuesday's results mean for 2012?  We'll be right back."
443,(Announcements)
444,MR. GREGORY:  Just a couple of final thoughts here.
445,"Chuck, you're thinking about 2012 already."
446,"MR. TODD:  Well, I am.  Actually, the White House is thinking a little bit about 2012.  David Plouffe cares about three states; that's Florida, Colorado and Ohio.  But Republicans are very excited about the sweep that they are going to have in Wisconsin.  It's bigger--every other Midwestern state is explainable in a very state-specific way.  Wisconsin is a big comeback for Republicans.  They love the fact that they may really put it on the map in 2012."
447,"MR. GREGORY:  Tom Brokaw, final thought as we go into Tuesday?"
448,"MR. BROKAW:  Well, as Jon Stewart might call me, I'm the old dude at this table, so I remember a long time ago.  And at the end of the first two years of Ronald Reagan's administration, the unemployment numbers were higher than they are now, his approval ratings were lower than President Obama's are. President Clinton, at the end of his first two years, had Newt Gingrich sweep into office with the Contract With America.  Guess what?  Both of them were elected by wide margins when they ran for a second term, something to keep in mind."
449,"MR. GREGORY:  Charlie Cook, just 15 seconds, your final outlook for Tuesday is what?"
450,MR. COOK:  Explosive on the House and very impressive Republican gains on the Senate and gubernatorial level.
451,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We're going to leave it there.  Thank you all. 
452,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  Before we go, a programming note.  Visit our Web site tomorrow for our Web-only special, MEET THE PRESS 2010:  THE FINAL COUNTDOWN. Our special pre-election day roundtable with break down everything you want to know going into Tuesday.  I'll be joined again by The National Journal's Charlie Cook, plus Politico's Jonathan Martin, Washington Post's Chris Cillizza, and our own Kelly O'Donnell, our congressional correspondent.

5,"Announcer: From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
6,"MR. GREGORY: Good morning. President Obama will spend next week talking up his proposals to improve the economy and lower the 9.6 percent jobless rate. The New York Times reporting this morning that in his speech in Cleveland on Wednesday he will ask Congress to increase and permanently extend a corporate tax credit for research and development. With the election season officially under way now this Labor Day weekend, the president must convince voters that Democrats will offer the best prescription for turning the economy around and creating jobs."
7,"With us now from his home state of South Carolina, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.
Senator, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS."
8,SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you. Good morning.
9,"MR. GREGORY: I want to start on the economy. The president, reacting to the latest jobs
numbers..."
10,SEN. GRAHAM: Mm-hmm.
11,MR. GREGORY: ...in the Rose Garden on Friday offered this assessment of where things stand. Let's show that.
12,"(Videotape, Friday)"
13,"PRES. BARACK OBAMA: But the, the key point I'm making right now is that the economy is moving in a positive direction, jobs are being created, they're just not being created as fast as
they need to given the big hole that we experienced. And we're going to have to continue to
work with Republicans and Democrats to come up with ideas that can further accelerate that job growth."
14,(End videotape)
15,"MR. GREGORY: So, Senator, what more should be done, and would you support what the
president appears to be talking about, which is an extension of that R and D tax credit for corporations?"
16,"SEN. GRAHAM: Yes, I would. We need to extend all the tax cuts. Now's not the time to raise
taxes. The president has openly said that he wants to increase taxes to 39.6, the top rate, let
some of the Bush tax cuts expire. Let's look at the healthcare bill. The centerpiece of the
Democratic agenda for the first two years has been the healthcare bill. Not one candidate on the campaign trail is talking about it. The stimulus bill that was supposed to keep us at 8 percent or below unemployment has been an absolute disaster. It grew the government instead of creating private sector jobs. Let's go into the stimulus bill, cancel a lot of the big-spending government programs in the stimulus bill, look at health care, get it off the, the public's back, and extend all the tax cuts. "
17,"MR. GREGORY: Well, we'll talk about tax cuts in a moment. You talk about the healthcare bill. Should Republicans be out there talking about a repeal of health care in this campaign season?"
18,"SEN. GRAHAM: Yes, they should be talking about replacing the healthcare bill. It's going to lead to a government monopoly in health care. It's going to bend the cost curve up, not down. It's going to increase--it's going to make it harder for private sector people to offer health care to
the employees. I talked to Ron Wyden about an opt-out provision where states could opt out of this massive healthcare bill and have more flexibility. The key to this is that no Democrat is
talking about healthcare bill, no Democrat is talking about the stimulus bill. You know, President Obama ran in the center as a centrist, and he's governed from the left ditch. He turned his agenda over to the liberals in the House, and here we are a few months before the election
and it's all caught up with him. "
19,"MR. GREGORY: If Republicans are so concerned about the deficit and the overall spending
picture in Washington, as Republican leaders say they are, when you talk about extending the
Bush tax cuts, yes, it's existing tax policy, but is there a responsibility for Republicans to say, if
you want to extend all the cuts, that somehow you have to pay for what the impact will be going forward, beyond the expiration date, on the Treasury? "
20,"SEN. GRAHAM: Only if you believe that America taxes too little. I think America taxes too
much, and we certainly spend too much. So I would extend the tax cuts to create private sector jobs. If you increase taxes now on--at any level, it's going to make it harder to create jobs. And we've lost 2 1/2 million jobs since the stimulus package passed. We're at 9.6 unemployment. So I don't think we tax too little, I think we spend too much. "
21,"MR. GREGORY: Is there room for compromise on tax cuts? Say, if the president were to
extend all the tax cuts for a period of a couple of years, would that be able to attract Republican support?"
22,"SEN. GRAHAM: It might. There's certainly some room to compromise on the death tax. In
January it goes back to 55 percent, at the end of this year it's at zero. So maybe you could find a way to compromise on the death tax to have something below 55 percent, a $5 or $6 million exemption for American families out there that would prevent devastation to small business and family farms. But if the--the idea of increasing taxes now, David, makes no sense to most people. And the agenda the president and his Democratic colleagues has offered the country has increased the deficit, increased the role of the federal government. And he ran as a centrist, and most Americans would say, ""Well, I never believed he would do all this."" And everything has been so partisan. There was a bipartisan bill on health care, Wyden-Bennett, that was rejected. Senator McCain had a $450 billion stimulus bill. But we didn't go down any of these compromise roses--roads, just big government, more spending. And the Democrats don't have a whole lot to talk about going into November other than more debt and more government. "
23,"MR. GREGORY: Well, let's talk about November and let's talk about the political landscape. Do you think there is irrational exuberance among Republicans who think they're going to take over the House and perhaps even the Senate? Or do you think the Democratic control is indeed
in jeopardy? "
24,"SEN. GRAHAM: I think if we voted tomorrow we would do very well. But the truth of the matter is that most of this is a rejection of a Democratic agenda that did not meet the expectations that President Obama created about a new way of doing business. The healthcare bill not only is a monstrosity in terms of growing the government and cutting out the private sector, the way it was passed was sleazy. Every old Washington trick was used to pass the healthcare bill. But, from a Republican point of view, we need to bring checks and balances, tell the American people if we get back in control, we're going to check this Obama agenda that has no limits and we're going to bring about balance by controlling spending, relooking at the healthcare bill, and trying to be more fiscally responsible. But a lot of this has to do without people saying--with people saying no to the Democrats, not saying yes to the Republicans. "
25,"MR. GREGORY: Well, so what happens then in the fall? Do you think Republican control--or
rather, Democratic control is in jeopardy?"
26,"SEN. GRAHAM: Yes. I think if the election were held tomorrow, it would be. There's a
couple of months to go, and at the end of the day, I don't know what their agenda's going to be between now and November. But what they've done in the past no one seems to like. The
healthcare bill is not being talked about by any Democrat. The stimulus bill has been an absolute flop. So I don't know what they do between now and November other than run against us. "
27,"MR. GREGORY: Right. Isn't part of the issue, though--you talk about the ways of Washington. Do you think anybody's going to look at Washington and absolve Republicans for opposing just about everything the president proposed? "
28,"SEN. GRAHAM: I'm glad we--well, there was a better way. There was a bipartisan approach to health care that was rejected. There was a $450 billion stimulus package that cut taxes, helped the unemployed, and did infrastructure projects. They've rejected this approach."
29,"They've gone hard to the left, and now they have nothing to show for their efforts but bigger
government and more debt. There was a better way; they chose not to go that way. Now they own this agenda that I think has been the most liberal agenda in modern times. And, at the end of the day, the public is not in the left ditch, they're not in the right ditch, they're in the right center of the road. And the only way the president can possibly survive is come back to the middle. He's tone deaf. Putting KSM on trial in New York City made no sense. Interjecting himself into the mosque debate made no sense. He's tone deaf on terrorism issues, and he's certainly tone deaf on the economy. "
30,"MR. GREGORY: Let, let me ask you about troubles within the Republican Party. It's got a 46
percent negative rating right now, hardly a sweeping mandate for power. And you said this to
The New York Times Magazine..."
31,SEN. GRAHAM: Right.
32,"MR. GREGORY: ...back in July, in terms of the state of the Republican Party, I'll put it up on
the screen: ""In a previous conversation,"" the magazine reports, ""Graham said, `The problem
with the Tea Party,'"" a big force in the party right now, ""`I think it's just unsustainable because they can never come up with a coherent vision for governing the country. It will die out.' Now he said, in a tone"" casual--""in a tone of casual lament, `We don't have a lot of Reagan-type leaders in our party. Remember Ronald Reagan Democrats? I want a Republican that can attract Democrats.' Chortling, he added, `Ronald Reagan would have a hard time getting elected as a Republican today.'"" Is this a Republican Party prepared for the majority to--prepared to actually lead and not just oppose? "
33,"SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, I think so. I think we can unite with our tea party friends and say no to
the Obama agenda; but we also can say yes to fiscal control. We could have a spending freeze
in nondefense areas. We could offer a constitutional amendment to balance the budget that
would make both parties have to get their fiscal house in order. There's a lot of things we can
do on health care that would expand coverage and limit the government--not have this
government monopoly. So I think with the tea party, independent groups, we can come up with a fiscally sound and try to help the president on foreign policy matters where we can."
34,"MR. GREGORY: But you've tried to position yourself as something of a maverick within the
party. You talk about Ronald Reagan not being able to get elected at this point. The tea partiers have called you a ""Republican in name only."" Do you think the Republicans have some, some work to do before they can really achieve majority status? "
35,"SEN. GRAHAM: Well I think what we have to do is come up with a uniting--an agenda, sort of a contract with America. What would we do different on spending? What would we--you know, I, I support the line-item veto. I would give President Obama the line-item veto. But let's look at the, the healthcare bill. Let's replace it with something that expands coverage in the private sector. Let's look at the stimulus bill that doubled the Department of Education's budget and redo the stimulus bill to create jobs. There's a lot of things we can do to balance out what
Obama's done and going forward show the American people the Republican Party can govern. I want a coalition of tea party people, independents, moderate Democrats trying to find a way to move this country forward before we become Greece."
36,"MR. GREGORY: Senator, I want to conclude by asking you a question about Iraq and Afghanistan. The president, of course, ended Operation Iraqi Freedom with an Oval Office
address, addressing the nation on that point on the end of the war. Our own chief foreign
correspondent, Richard Engel, who covered the war throughout and has covered the war in
Afghanistan as well, offered some analysis during an appearance with Ann Curry on the
""Today"" show about the legacy of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. I'd like you to listen and react to it."
37,"(Videotape, Tuesday, ""Today"")"
38,"MR. RICHARD ENGEL: If there had been no invasion, Saddam would still be in power. He
was probably getting more moderate. He was being welcomed into the--into--by, by a lot of
European countries. He was being welcomed into Eastern Europe in particular. He was heading
in a, in a direction of, of accommodation. The, the sanctions regime that was holding him in
place was starting to fail. So I think he would--it would be somewhat of a, a basket case, but it would still--it would be--Iran would be a lot more contained. "
39,MS. ANN CURRY: Hm.
40,"MR. ENGEL: So it would be a dictatorship that was trying to break out of its box, but Iran
would not be as dangerous as it, as it is today."
41,"MS. CURRY: And had the United States not invaded Iraq, would we be done in Afghanistan?"
42,"Mr. ENGEL: Probably. That was a giant distraction of resources, of intelligence assets. That
war would probably be over."
43,(End videotape)
44,"MR. GREGORY: Senator, what do you say?"
45,"SEN. GRAHAM: Completely rewriting history. Our planes were being shot at in the no-fly
zones, Saddam Hussein was violating every U.N. resolution to account for his weapons
program, he was openly defying the international community when it came to controlling Iraq.
He was not becoming a good citizen, he was becoming a more dangerous dictator. The world is
better with him dead. If we can get a government together soon in Iraq and it becomes stable
and secure, we'll have a democracy between Iran and Syria. Iran's biggest nightmare is to have a neighbor on their border who practices democracy. So the 4,400 young men and women
who've died have done this country a great service by securing Iraq and making..."
46,"MR. GREGORY: Well, nobody's disputing whether they've done the country a great service. But even our current..."
47,SEN. GRAHAM: We're safer.
48,"MR. GREGORY: ...defense secretary, who's a Republican says, ""Iraq will always be clouded
by how it began."" Three-quarters of the American people think it was not worth the cost."
49,"SEN. GRAHAM: Well, I can tell you, we will be safer by how it ends. History will judge us,
not by what we did wrong at the beginning, but what we got right at the end. If we can get the government stable in--and, and President Obama, it is now his job to finish out Iraq. If it
finishes out well and it becomes secure and stable, allied with us on the war on terror--this is the place al-Qaeda was beat by fellow Muslims. I can't underestimate how important that was. Al-Qaeda went into Iraq to topple our efforts to bring about stability and representative government, and they were, they were beaten by Muslims with our help. That is a huge win in
the war on terror. So Afghanistan is a--we're getting things better, we got a long ways to go, but I am glad we did what we did in Iraq. America will be safer and history will record this as a big event in the Mideast where a dictatorship was replaced by a democracy in the heart of the Arab world. "
50,"MR. GREGORY: All right. But, Senator, before, before you go, on Afghanistan, do you
believe that the president withdrawal timeline of next summer, July of 2011, do you now think
that that can be met?"
51,"SEN. GRAHAM: I think it's wrong for the president to say we're going to withdraw next
summer no matter what. I do believe with surge forces some areas of Afghanistan are going to
be able to transition safely. But the president's insistence that we're going to withdraw without--no matter what the conditions are..."
52,"MR. GREGORY: But that's not, that's not accurate."
53,SEN. GRAHAM: ...is hurting our efforts in Afghanistan.
54,"MR. GREGORY: He has said it's going to be conditions-based.
SEN. GRAHAM: No, here's what he said, ""We're going to withdraw no matter what. How
quickly we withdraw will be conditions-based."" That's different than saying, ""We're going to
evaluate next summer and make the best decision."" I do see a pathway forward for some limited withdrawal, but the president has announced to the world we're going to begin to leave next summer, the only thing in question is how quick. That is a different way of approaching it. I would rather say, ""Our goal is to transition next summer. We'll see what the conditions are."" At the end of the day, his statements has hurt. But there is progress in Afghanistan. The surge is beginning to show some benefits in the area of security. The corruption issue looms large in
Afghanistan. It's as big an enemy to the Afghan people as the Taliban, and we must be able to
fight corruption as effectively as the Taliban. That is a work in progress. "
55,"MR. GREGORY: Right. Senator Graham, we will leave it there. Thank you as always for
being here. "
56,SEN. GRAHAM: Thank you. And extend the Bush tax cuts.
57,"MR. GREGORY: OK, a final salvo there."
58,"Joining us now with a view from the other side we turn to the man who is in charge of getting
Barack Obama elected president, his 2008 campaign manager and author of the newly-updated
paperback version of his book, ""The Audacity to Win: How Obama Won and How We Can
Beat the Party of Limbaugh, Beck, and Palin."""
59,"David Plouffe, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS."
60,"MR. DAVID PLOUFFE: Good to be with you, David."
61,"MR. GREGORY: A lot to get to. I want to start on the economy and domestic affairs, and we'll
touch on the wars, as I did with Senator Graham, just a minute. I want to start with the reality, and that is that this president and his party are running on an economic record. And here is that record in a nutshell, and it's not a good one: 9.6 percent unemployment rate, 14.9 million unemployed, 6.2 million of which are long-term unemployed beyond 27 weeks, an estimated three million property foreclosures this year. We cannot forget the depth of the housing crisis. After 19 months in office, President Obama is accountable for this record, is he not? "
62,"MR. PLOUFFE: Sure he is. We're less than 60 days out from election and elections are about
choices. So let's remember where we were. The Republican Party that wants to gain back
control, their policies contributed to the worst economic crisis this country's seen since the
Great Depression. If they had their way, we might have headed to a depression, opposing the
Recovery Act. So no one's satisfied with where we are. The question is, are we making
progress? We had 22 straight months in this country of private sector job loss. We've had eight
straight months of private sector job gain. Not as high as anyone would like, but we're on the
right path here. And so the question for the American people is, the Republican experiment's a
very recent one--fiscal irresponsibility, really, an unprecedented assault on the middle-class and small businesses. The same exact policies--and by the way, the guy who's in charge of the Republican campaign committee was on your show about six weeks ago and said if they won back the majority what they were going to pursue were the same policies they had done
previously, which led to this economic calamity. "
63,"MR. GREGORY: But isn't it striking after 19 months, rather than being able to run on a record,
when this president's had some big swings legislatively at the economy, that you are left
basically saying, ""Well, you know, we, we may not have done the job, but the other guys are
really worse."""
64,"MR. PLOUFFE: Well, no one's saying we're not doing the job. We're very proud of what
we've done, which is, this hole was so deep, it's going to--as the president said at his inaugural address, it's going to take some time to dig out. But we're on the right path here: economic policies aimed squarely at the middle class and small businesses; creating a new energy sector; the healthcare law which, over time, I think is going to play a big impact on economic growth. So, no, we're proud to talk about what we've done."
65,"MR. GREGORY: But 82 percent, but 82 percent of Americans polled believe that the country's
still in recession."
66,"MR. PLOUFFE: Well, people are struggling. No one's suggesting otherwise. But the question
is..."
67,"MR. GREGORY: Yeah. So they don't believe what you say, which is that we're on the right
path."
68,"MR. PLOUFFE: Well, you're--when people are struggling, they don't have a job, their family
member doesn't have a job, they haven't got a raise, they're right to be frustrated. The question we have to put in front of people in these next two months is, this is a choice. And the Republican ideas were soundly rejected at the ballot box the last two years, more importantly were soundly rejected by the American people. They're offering nothing new, the same old policies that led this country this close--Senator Graham was talking about, you know, the right ditch, the left ditch, they drove us into the ditch. And if we give the keys back to the people who did this, it would be like giving Herbert Hoover the keys in the mid-1930s."
69,"MR. GREGORY: The, the summation--Time magazine has a summation of sort of the depth of
the political peril for the president and the Democrats. I'll put it up on the screen. ""With
midterm elections just nine weeks off, instead of generational transformation some Democrats
predicted after 2008, the president's party teeters on the brink of a broad setback in November, including the possible loss of both houses of Congress. By a 10-point margin, people say they will vote for Republicans over Democrats in Congress, the largest such gap ever recorded by Gallup."" How did it get so bad?"
70,"MR. PLOUFFE: Well, first of all, when you have a tough economy and you're in power, you're
going to have a tough political environment. Secondly, we won so many elections in 2006 and
2008. Even in a neutral electoral environment, it was clear we were going to give some of that
back. So, over the next two months, what we really have to do is two things. One,  Republicans are very enthusiastic about voting. We have to get more Democrats enthused about voting. I think laying out the stakes of this election, the real choice, that they're not just going to bring bad ideas, they're going to roll back all that the president and his party's accomplished. And secondly, for those undecided voters out there, make them understand this is not the new Republican Party. It's the same old ideas, the same old adherence to the special interests. You know, Speaker Boehner was talking about all the reforms he's going to bring. I mean, give me a break. These are the--this is the party that tried to change the rules to allow the majority leader to still serve if he was indicted. John Boehner, who would be the speaker of the House, years ago was handing out checks from tobacco companies on the House floor and is now up on Wall Street saying, ""Give us money because we're protecting you by opposing things like financial reform."" So, so the movie was a nightmare for America, it's a recent experiment, and we have to make sure everybody out there who's undecided and, just as importantly, those Democrats who aren't any threat to vote for a Republican but who are saying, ""I'm sure if I'm going to vote,"" we have to go talk to them and make sure they understand the stakes here."
71,"MR. GREGORY: One of the things you said back in January of 2009 is that bipartisanship was
so important. And this is what you told The Washington Post at the time. ""One thing I'm sure
of, there's not going to be a Democratic solution to the economy or a Democratic healthcare
plan or a Democratic energy plan. It's got to be an American plan and effort, and if that
happens, I think we can make progress."" The reality is they have all been Democratic plans.
You have not had bipartisanship, you have lost tremendous ground with 60 percent disapproval
among independent voters. Isn't that problem you, you warned of?"
72,"MR. PLOUFFE: Well, first one, bipartisanship, actually, you know, we did get some
Republican support for things like the Recovery Act, for financial reform, on healthcare, is
right. But the votes might have all been Democratic, but the truth is there were so many
Republican ideas in there. And what the--and this is another argument for the election. The
Republicans' opposition with the president and a lot of our party has tried to do is less grounded in principle than it is in politics. This country's in--got deep challenges, but opportunities, too. And rather than participate in trying to move this country forward, the Republicans, in a very crave and crass way, are playing short-term politics. And listen, we're going to have a tough election this November. I think it can be better than people think, but I think the long-term damage the Republican Party is doing to themself is profound."
73,"MR. GREGORY: Well, and I want to get to the Republicans in just a minute, but let me pin
you down on that point. Is Democratic control of the House and the Senate in jeopardy?"
74,"MR. PLOUFFE: What I would say is, I think right now, because this is going to be elections
between two people in a state, in some cases it'll be three people where there's tea party third
party candidates, but in states in districts. And I think if you look at that, the Senate, they'd
have to run the table. I don't see any evidence of that, and we've got people running strong
campaigns. We've won a lot of special elections in the House because our House candidates are running great localized campaigns, really focusing on turnout and making that a choice between two individuals. So, now this is turbulent political environment. We have big majorities. So of course we're going to give some of that back. But I think we can maintain control in both chambers if we make this a choice between two people in districts and states, and we have to make sure Democratic turnout jumps up because, right now, the Republicans are coming out at a very high level. We shouldn't expect that to abate."
75,"MR. GREGORY: But isn't part of what you're getting out here is that you have to basically
shift the, the mindset of voters to the shortcomings of their opponents because, if it is a
referendum on the president and his leadership, you come up short?"
76,"MR. PLOUFFE: Well, I--listen, elections are choices. So we're happy to talk about, you know,
the Recovery Act and what it meant, the jobs and businesses that have sprouted up all over
America, the new energy economy, combat--our operations in Iraq coming to a close, all the
healthcare assist that seniors are going to get. And so..."
77,MR. GREGORY: But I'm asking about the president's leadership...
78,MR. PLOUFFE: Yeah.
79,"MR. GREGORY: ...whether that's being graded here, whether it's being tested here."
80,"MR. PLOUFFE: I think the way voters look at this election is: I've got two people running for
the Senate or for the House, and they're going to evaluate positions and views and vote for those people. But listen, I think we as Democrats, we do have to make this a choice, and so the Republicans need to be on trial here, too. But we ought to be proud of what we've done because this is leadership. We--these were not normal times. We were facing unprecedented economic crisis and issues like health care, energy, education, that leadership in this town had refused to deal with for decades."
81,"MR. GREGORY: But, look, the Democrats are in, in power. You, you--one of the things that
got you to the White House was the strength of independent support. Independent voters, as I said, are now disapproving of the president's performance at a 60 percent margin. You have
made the point that everybody out there in America's making adjustments in their lives.
Washington doesn't seem to be making any adjustments in the way they're spending money or
running the government. That has to lay at the door post--or the doormat of the president and
the Democrats. "
82,"MR. PLOUFFE: Well, first of all, I do think most voters out there think, when asked who's
really trying to reach out to the other side, who's trying to bring more of spirit of, of debate and bipartisanship to Washington, believe the president's trying to. Secondly, on spending, you
know, the president's done some tough things on spending. First of all, being honest about the
spending, you know, for the first time in a long time. The Republicans, obviously, are lecturing
us about fiscal discipline. It was their policies and their fiscal positions that led us to this
position. So we--first of all, we should not take any lectures from them. And on tax cuts,
which Senator Graham just talked about, they want to extend them for another 10 years, which is $700 billion, without paying for them. So we have to remind people, when President Clinton left office, we had a surplus. We had a record deficit over $1.3 trillion when President Obama took office. Why? Because the Republicans had unpaid for wars, tax cuts, entitlement expansion. Do you really believe three years later you can trust them on fiscal matters?"
83,"MR. GREGORY: Well, but, but let's talk about tax cuts for a second, because Mark Zandi,
who is an economist who has advised Republicans and Democrats, wrote this in The New York
Times about the tax cuts we can afford. ""The prudent middle ground,"" he wrote, ""would be to
forestall any tax increases in 2011 and to phase in higher rates on upper-income households in
2012 when the economy will be on firmer ground."" In other words, don't raise any taxes right
now, extend all the Bush-era tax cuts. Why isn't that a good idea? There are a lot of
Democrats, by the way, lining up behind that very position."
84,"MR. PLOUFFE: First thing I'd say, what the congressional Republicans are proposing is a
permanent extension of tax cuts for the wealthiest, which means 80 percent of the people that
get those tax cuts are millionaires, OK? Permanent. Now, in a recession, I understand those who say maybe for a year we should consider this. My view would be, and I'm not an
economist, and I'm certainly not involved in these decisions. The White House..."
85,MR. GREGORY: But what's the president's view?
86,"MR. PLOUFFE: But here's that, that if we're going to borrow money from the Chinese to give
further tax cuts it not--ought not go to millionaires. We ought to do more for small businesses
in tax cuts. So what the president is proposing is permanent extension of tax cuts for the middle class. We have a small business plan right now in front of the United States Senate that would provide huge tax relief, incentive for lending, incentive for expansion. That's what we ought to be doing."
87,"MR. GREGORY: Would the president entertain the idea of extending all the tax cuts for a
period of two years?"
88,"MR. PLOUFFE: You know, I don't know what his final position's going to be. I--what--he's
been pretty clear on this, which is the middle class and small businesses ought to be the target of our tax relief, that those at the very top--and again, we're not talking about the mom and pop small business person, we're talking about 80 percent of the people the Republicans want to give permanent tax credits to are millionaires, without paying for it. So this is a very important issue, I think. We won the tax debate with John McCain in 2008 because the American people believed that we wanted to tuck--cut taxes for them, not the big corporate interests and not millionaires in this country."
89,"MR. GREGORY: I'm curious, when we talk about economic recovery and the political scene,
former President Clinton has been campaigning, The New York Times covered one of his
statements when he was on the trail, and I'll put it up on the screen. He said, ""A year and a half just wasn't enough time to get us out of the hole we are in, so I want you to stick with us. Give us two more years, two more years until another election. If we fail, you can throw us all out."" Does President Obama see it that way? In other words, he's got one term to turn this thing around? "
90,"MR. PLOUFFE: He doesn't view it through the prism of politics. He views it through the
prism of the country was in an enormous hole so we had to do everything we can to dig out of
that. Plus, we had ignored the long-term challenges of health care, energy, economy, education reform. And that's how he views it. And if you make decisions based on politics, you're going to do the country a big disservice."
91,"MR. GREGORY: But, but what, what, what maybe President Clinton was referring to, do you
envision a primary challenge from another Democrat in 2012 against this president?"
92,"MR. PLOUFFE: Oh, I can't imagine that. And, you know, we've got--listen, we've got one
election in front of us. It seemed like the last one just ended."
93,MR. GREGORY: Right.
94,MR. PLOUFFE: So there'll be time to talk about 2012.
95,"MR. GREGORY: But given who made that statement, do you--can you rule out, based on
actual information, that Secretary of State Clinton would not pursue the presidency again,
would not challenge President Obama?"
96,"MR. PLOUFFE: Listen, you saw this week they're working so well together, working on
Middle East peace, and it's a wonderful partnership. And, you know, I think that was a really
inspired choice by the president, and Secretary of State Clinton is just doing a remarkable job."
97,"MR. GREGORY: So is that a yes, no, or maybe?"
98,"MR. PLOUFFE: Listen, they're, they're, they're a team and a great team for America."
99,"MR. GREGORY: I want to talk more generally about the, the economy. Christina Romer, the
president's top economic adviser, leaving the White House, suggested there should be additional stimulus, as she was leaving, tax breaks but also additional infrastructure spending. Does the president think in retrospect that he did too little to jump-start the economy?"
100,"MR. PLOUFFE: Oh, I don't think so. And, listen, obviously you mentioned at the top of your
show, the president's going to be unveiling some more proposals this week to, to help with the
economy. And I think they're going to look at everything they can because this is a crisis out
there for the American people. But no. And the--listen, it's very clear, economists who have
looked at this said that this Recovery Act added over three million jobs. As I said, 22 straight
months of private sector job loss. So these aren't government. Eight straight months of private
sector job creation. Recovery Act played a big role there. We would have been unemployment
rate probably in the high teens. Some economists even say over 20 percent, by the way.
So the Recovery Act that the Republicans are attacking, if they had their way, we wouldn't have done anything like that. We probably would have unemployment rate--if the Republican ideas and policies had been in place that drove us into this economic calamity in the first place, we'd be sitting here with unemployment almost double what it is, with no positive growth, no glimmers that we're coming out of this. So again, big choice. But, no, I think that history will show that the Recovery Act, the help for the financial sector, the auto industry--by the way, all of these things were clearly going to be very tough politics. But this wasn't--the America--the, the country was in crisis and the president and a lot of people in his party knew they were going to take tough political positions to try and move the country forward and stave off another Great Depression. And they did that, and we should be proud of that."
101,"MR. GREGORY: Is President Obama the campaigner-in-chief in this midterm season? Or is
he as much of a liability as an asset around the country?"
102,"MR. PLOUFFE: No. He's, first of all, president. But he's going to be out there making his case
about how he sees these elections, the stakes in the elections, why we can't afford to, to go back, which is essentially the question here. Again, we'd all--no one's completely satisfied with where we are in the moment. But are we going to continue on a path of forward progress or are we going to go back? And I think he'll make that case out there. Obviously, he's got a lot of other duties."
103,"MR. GREGORY: Finally, a quote from your book, handicapping the Republican field, this is
what you write in the new part of ""Audacity to Win."" ""This is the Republican Party of 2010, and
I think it will be the Republican Party for a long time. It is hard to see how a Republican gets
the presidential nomination without winning the plurality of the Palin-Limbaugh-Beck base of
the Republican Party. Without a drastic change in orientation, they will probably nominate
someone a good bit out of the mainstream."" Who do you have in mind? Who do you think is
the most formidable Republican likely to challenge President Obama?"
104,"MR. PLOUFFE: Oh, I have no idea. I mean, this time four years ago there was very few of us
talking about Barack Obama running for president, including me. So I think some of the people
that we think are going to run may not run. There'll be other people who'll run. We'll see. I
wish I could just sit back with a tub of popcorn and, and enjoy it because I think it's going to be quite an adventure."
105,"MR. GREGORY: But who is the leader of the Republican Party, would you say?"
106,"MR. PLOUFFE: I think the--I think right now--and this is a problem for them long term--I do
think that Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin, they are the leaders of the party. And you
see whenever--I was struck by--Senator Coburn from Oklahoma, I think, was at a town hall
meeting and said, ""I don't agree with anything the Democrats are doing, and I don't agree with
Speaker Pelosi, but she's a nice person,"" and got attacked for that. There, there is an intolerance in that party and an extremism that I think is where the real energy is. And so I think, as you see in '11 and '12, as that presidential primary, those are the people that are going to come out to vote. So I think that's where the real energy is, and I think particularly in, in elections where more people vote, in presidential elections where you have a lot more younger people, minorities, independent voters who skew a little bit more moderate, that's going to be a big problem. So we'll just have to wait and see. But let's get this--through this election first, and then we'll be right on to the next one."
107,MR. GREGORY: Will you be running the re-election campaign for the president?
108,"MR. PLOUFFE: I don't know. We--again, we're not focused on that. You know, he's very
focused on trying to do the right things for the country. There'll be a time for politics, and at
that point, all of us that feel strongly in his leadership will do all we can to help him."
109,"MR. GREGORY: And we'll be watching. David Plouffe, thank you very much.
And up next, the hottest races across the nation in this fall midterm campaign. Can the
Democrats hold on to both the House and the Senate, or is a GOP takeover in the cards?
Insights from our roundtable: Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report, CNBC's Erin Burnett, E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post, and Rich Lowry of the National Review."
110,(Announcements)
111,"MR. GREGORY: Coming up, our roundtable previews the biggest races to watch this fall. Is
the Democrats' hold on the House and Senate in jeopardy? After this brief commercial break."
112,(Announcements)
113,"MR. GREGORY: We're back. Joining me now, our political roundtable: editor of the
National Review and Fox News contributor Rich Lowry, Washington Post columnist E.J.
Dionne, editor of The Cook Political Report and political analyst for the National Journal
Charlie Cook, and anchor of CNBC's ""Street Signs"" and ""Squawk on the Street,"" Erin Burnett. Welcome to all of you."
114,"Erin, I want to start with you because there is news on the tax question. You heard Senator
Graham say, yeah, he could support what the president's talking about, a research credit, a tax credit for corporations. Is this what the business community wants to hear more from the
administration? "
115,"MS. ERIN BURNETT: They do. And by the way, that particular tax credit is very, very
popular. It's likely to go through. It's got a big price tag to it, $100 billion, but they like it.
They, of course, want to hear more."
116,MR. GREGORY: Yeah.
117,"MS. BURNETT: Some of them are along the lines of, ""Look, we can start to create a lot more
jobs if we have more tax breaks for business."" But it looks like the research credit is something
that will be popular, he can get support clearly on both sides of the aisle for that. But that's
probably as far as he's going to be able to go when it comes to those business tax credits."
118,"MR. GREGORY: And big picture, the president maintains, in response to the jobs numbers,
""Look, we're going in the right direction here. We are part of the solution, not part of the
problem."" But as I suggested to David Plouffe, there is a--an economic record there that is tough to run on."
119,"MS. BURNETT: Yes, very tough to run on. He's right, though. I mean, I call it the ""tortoise
economy."" The economy's growing. The numbers are coming out. We're getting better--in fact,
after this recession we have--our recovery started more quickly than after any other recession in the past 25 years. So it's accurate to say we're growing and we're going in the right  direction."
120,"Politically, though, how do you spin a 9.6 unemployment rate to have it be positive? That's
incredibly difficult. And it's very hard politically to see how they're going to make that case."
121,"MR. GREGORY: Rich Lowry, are Republicans going to give this president anything on taxes,
any victory before November, even if on paper it makes sense, it's something that they would
want?"
122,"MR. RICH LOWRY: Remains to be seen. Just at this time of year everything becomes so
political. And this research and development credit, businesses and corporations love it. But
it's been around since, what, 1981 or something? It's not a new initiative. It's not going to make a big difference in the economy, in the aggregate. And that's the problem the administration has had since the stimulus, which I think is pretty clearly a failure. Everything since then it's been $20 billion, $30 billion here. That just doesn't make a big difference in a $14 trillion economy. "
123,"MR. GREGORY: E.J., the economy and taxes and where things stand."
124,"MR. E.J. DIONNE: Well, actually, I think the administration is in a position where it should
pick a big fight with the Republicans. I, I at least half agree with what Rich just said. They're
clearly down in this election. If the election were held now, they'd probably lose the House,
though not the Senate. I think they can claw back enough to hold on to the House. I think they should pick a big fight on the renewal of the Bush tax cuts and say, ""We want to renew them for everybody earning under $250,000 a year. Heck, maybe we can actually renew them for everybody earning under a million dollars a year."" Draw a line and say, ""We want to give them tax cuts now. They want to fight for millionaires."" So you can have that fight. I think they can win it. But they need to shake up this race to salvage some of those seats. They need to hang on to 218 House seats. "
125,"MR. GREGORY: Right. I'm going to get to Charlie in a second. But, Rich, back to the--you know, because I've, I've pressed Republicans on the point of, ""Hey, you want to cut the deficit? Well, it's going to cost $3 trillion to extend all of these tax cuts. How do you pay for it?"" And  Republicans say to me, ""You know, that's--that argument is off base here, that it's existing tax policy and that you shouldn't be making that argument."" And respond to E.J.'s point."
126,"MR. LOWRY: Well, there, there, there are a couple things. I think E.J.'s political advice is
exactly wrong, although I appreciate him half agreeing with me. I'll take what--I'll take
whatever I can get."
127,MR. GREGORY: Right. That may be all you get.
128,MR. DIONNE: That's great progress.
129,MR. GREGORY: That may be all you get.
130,"MR. LOWRY: But, you know, before August, before they left--Congress left for the August
recess, you had three Senate Democrats saying, ""We need to extend all these things less
temporarily."" And that was before this awful last month the Democrats suffered. I think it only
got harder, if not impossible, not to extend all of these. So I expect the Obama administration
either to say, ""Let's do it for one year,"" or to punt it to the lame duck session. But even if they
extend it for one year, that will be an amazing sign. If you have these large Democratic
majorities in the Senate and the House extending all the Bush tax cuts, huge sign of the way the worm has turned politically."
131,MR. GREGORY: Yes.
132,"MR. DIONNE: One idea is to put on the table, one of the things you could do with the money
you save from not giving the tax cut to people earning over $1 million, you could either
redistribute the rest of that to people down below a million, or you could begin to create an
infrastructure bank to try to build us for the long-term. You need to look like you're making a--
you're drawing a clear line with the Republicans."
133,"MR. LOWRY: But there, there, there you're sucking money out of the economy in the shortterm
in order for the long-term in a weak economy. That makes no sense. Raising taxes, there's
no theory in which raises taxes in a slow economy makes sense."
134,MR. GREGORY: All right.
135,"MR. LOWRY: Keynesians don't favor it, supply-siders don't favor it."
136,"MR. GREGORY: We can come back to this, but all of our effort in terms of our graphics have
been for you, Mr. Cook, OK? Because we want to look at the landscape as we kick off this
election season. All right..."
137,MR. CHARLIE COOK: I was feeling unloved.
138,"MR. GREGORY: Yeah. No, no, we got plenty of love for you. Here's the big picture, OK?
You see here 19 seats in the Senate that could plausibly turn over--13 held by Democrats, six by Republicans. You see that on our graphic. Now, let's look at some of the tight races. Open
seats, Republican seats in Florida and Kentucky. Florida the very interesting race. Former
House Speaker Marco Rubio, Kendrick Meek and Governor Charlie Crist. We should point out
we had hoped to have that Senate debate. Marco Rubio's father sadly passed away. Our
thoughts and prayers are with him, and we hope to reschedule that debate. But that is obviously a, a tightly fought contest. And in Kentucky, you've got Rand Paul, the tea party candidate, and the attorney general, Jack Conway. Rand Paul, in a poll out this morning, way ahead here. What do you see, Charlie? "
139,"MR. COOK: Well, I think Republicans have to almost run the table. And the thing about it is,
but that's pretty common. In fact, in three of the last six elections the--one party has won over 80 percent of the final toss-up races that are out there. So this--there's a cascading effect that tends to happen. Florida, you called it interesting, I'd call it bizarre. And early on, Democrats thought, ""Well, we get two bites of the apple. We'll have a Democratic nominee, and then we'll have Charlie Crist, who has turned away from the Republican Party."" But, instead, what you've got is Marco Rubio, the Republican has consolidated the right of center vote, so you basically have two candidates, a former Republican and a real Democrat that are splitting the nonconservative vote, and I think it gives a, gives an edge to Rubio."
140,"MR. GREGORY: OK. Let's look at some of the tight Democratic seats. These are incumbents
who could lose. We'll go through them. In California, very interesting race, Senator Boxer with
a tough fight on her hands with Carly Fiorina, former head of HP, of course. Then in
Washington State, Patty Murray defending against Dino Rossi. He's run for governor twice, a
more moderate Republican. He doesn't have to deal with Republican problems. He's got a lot
of--a better environment this year. Wisconsin, Russ Feingold is defending. He's got a primary--
the Republicans have a primary September 14th. Ron Johnson looks to be the most likely
Republican to win that race. And, of course, Nevada, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid,
trying to hold out Sharron Angle, also a tea party supporter. What strikes you about these
races?"
141,"MR. COOK: Well, this is a class of Democratic incumbents that have never had a really, really
difficult year and they've lived sort of charmed lives. And, and take Barbara Boxer, for
example. She's always been able to win by being a social, cultural liberal, and, and
environmentalist, and all of that. Well, the thing is--and which fits California very well. But in
a really, really tough economy, she's having a hard time sort of pivoting away from that
traditional Democratic message. Russ Feingold, his opponent was totally unknown in Wisconsin, was totally unknown three, four months ago, but he's a self-funder. He's never run for anything before, so he doesn't have a baggage of, of legislative voting record, anything like that. Democrats are having a hard time getting a handle, getting grip on him, and tearing him down because he doesn't have any record. "
142,"MR. GREGORY: And it's interesting, E.J., the president goes to Milwaukee to talk about the
economy tomorrow. Who won't be there? Russ Feingold. It goes to my question to David
Plouffe. Asset or liability? How does Obama work on the campaign trail this year?"
143,"MR. DIONNE: Obama is both, and that's the tricky thing for the Democrats. On the one hand,
they really need Obama to gin up turnout in the Democratic base. Among all those voters who
came in for the first time in 2008 to vote for him, but are looking like they won't vote this time,
particularly younger voters, African-American voters, so that's on the one side. On the other
side, Obama ignites the Republican base. And so I think you're going to see them using Obama
in an interesting way where he is going--they are going to use him to raise money, they are
going to use him to turn out the base. But candidates are going to have, you know, are going to pull away from them--from him when they have to. Democrats have used this strategy before. When they won the Mark Critz special election, the congressman from Pennsylvania, a very conservative district, Democrats were happy to pull him away from Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi if that's what it took to win."
144,"MR. GREGORY: Well, one of the things, Erin Burnett, is this--the populist streak running
through the country right now, and kind of who owns that populist anger. You talk about how
candidates are positioning themselves. Here is Congressman Joe Donnelly, he's in Indiana
running for re-election, he won in '08, and this is the ad he's running. It's about immigration,
but it tells an interesting story. Watch."
145,"(Videotape, Joe Donnelly campaign ad)"
146,"REP. JOE DONNELLY: I went down to the border and saw for myself just how bad the
situation really is. That's why I voted to hire 5,300 more border agents, penalize any business
that hires illegals, deport illegals who commit felonies, and eliminate amnesty because no one
should ever be rewarded for breaking the law. That may not be what the Washington crowd
wants, but I don't work for them, I work for you. I'm Joe Donnelly, and I approve this ad."
147,(End videotape)
148,"MR. GREGORY: Now here, of course, is a Democrat running against, you know, the
Washington crowd, all of them Democrats. But it goes to this point about the economy as well
and populist anger, which is the idea that--the criticism that President Obama ceded that ground to the Republicans, to the tea party, and he's got people out there, congressmen, saying, ""Look, I'm for you, I'm not with the guys in Washington."""
149,"MS. BURNETT: Yeah, I mean, it's amazing because you wouldn't even know necessarily what
party that ad came from unless you, unless you clarified it."
150,MR. GREGORY: Right.
151,"MS. BURNETT: The populist--I think you're right. He has ceded it. And every time he's
trying now, it's ""It was what I was handed by Bush."" I mean, there's this sort of, ""Let's go back
and blame that."" To me it seems like he can't really win on the tax front right now because the
left won't get enough, the right will say he's running up the deficit. I think he needs to take a
third way and come up with his vision of American exceptionalism, talk about this is the place
immigrants and the world want to come. We're the number one destination, we're the richest
and best country in the world, and he needs to take that positive, positive way of looking at it.
So that--and that's what he's good at. That's about rhetoric and vision, and that's where his
strength lies. "
152,"MR. GREGORY: All right, but for everybody here, what is the bottom line? How did the
president and Democrats get to this point? Is it a bad economy, case closed, Charlie, or is there a leadership question, a failure of leadership by the president that has got him to this point?"
153,"MR. COOK: Democrats desperately needed three things to happen this year. Number one, they
needed unemployment to turn around. And when you look at the, the groups that were sort of
the booster, that pushed them over the top, among African-Americans the unemployment rate is 16.3, you know, way more than it was when the president took office; Hispanics, 12; young
people, 26, the job market for recent college graduates the worst in 35 years. He desperately
needed unemployment to turn around. Number two, he needed attitudes toward healthcare
reform to fundamentally change, with people saying, ""OK..."
154,MR. GREGORY: And that hasn't happened.
155,"MR. COOK: And that--it just hasn't happened. And they had to get control of the agenda. And
right now what they're doing is they're paying a price for having focused so thoroughly on
health care for a solid year at a time when the economy was deteriorating. And, for a lot of
voters, they just see the president and Democrats as having checked the box on stimulus and
then gone to cap and trade and health care leaving the economy to deteriorate."
156,"MR. GREGORY: Have it out, you two. The question of the economy rules everything, or a
question of leadership, E.J.?"
157,"MR. DIONNE: First of all, in that Donnelly ad, it's interesting that John Boehner, the
Republican leader, was also in that picture."
158,MR. GREGORY: Yeah.
159,"MR. DIONNE: And there are Republicans--the Republicans are unpopular, too. That's going to
be something Democrats want to play. I think the biggest mistake Obama made was in not
making a big argument from the beginning, ""Here's where we started, here's where we're going.
It's going to be rough getting there. But if you stick with me, this is going to get better."" FDR
did that, Ronald Reagan did that. He needed to do that."
160,MR. GREGORY: But trust in government was different when FDR did it.
161,"MR. DIONNE: Right. But he needed to restore trust in government, and I think he was in a
position to do that. He needed to emphasize the way they're actually reforming government,
which they are, but nobody knows it."
162,"MR. GREGORY: The flipside of that question, you can address this big one."
163,MR. LOWRY: Sure.
164,"MR. GREGORY: But is also, have, have Republicans done anything to really regain trust about
their leadership..."
165,"MR. LOWRY: No, it's most..."
166,MR. GREGORY: ...to an oppositional strategy?
167,"MR. LOWRY: ...it's mostly a free gift from Obama fundamentally fumbling this. And I
disagree with E.J. again. I'm going to have to agree with you at some point, E.J. just to be a
good colleague here on the set. But people know what Obama's about. They know what the
program is. They know he's growing government because he thinks that's good for the economy and good for the country's future. They get it. The problem, I think, is threefold. One is ideological grandiosity. Democrats thought in '08 they had a mandate from heaven to do
everything they ever wanted, when really they were just getting an opportunity because people were recoiling from the Republicans and the poor state of the economy. Then there was the cynical opportunism that Charlie referred to, a crisis is--never let a crisis go to waste. Therefore do health care, try to cap and trade, things that have nothing to do with the economy or may actually be harmful to do it. And then three, there's the fact that the program has not worked on its own terms. The stimulus has not worked. So you add all three of those things up and you have a very grim picture. And another huge problem, independents are much closer to the tea partiers on the big issues and even on the smaller hot-button ones--spending, debt, Arizona immigration law, Ground Zero mosque, all that--much closer to the tea partiers than they are to the Democrats."
168,"MR. GREGORY: But, Erin Burnett, the big question on unemployment, if, if--and in 30
seconds, when is there a meaningful dent in the unemployment rate that can help these political fortunes?"
169,"MS. BURNETT: Well, I think it's interesting, because by the way, I don't think the stimulus has
been a failure, and I think that you are correct that it is perceived that way. But I don't think it's actually true. Without that stimulus, we would be significantly worse off than we are right now. There, there's really no question about it. You can ask any economist on Wall Street or any CEO. I see you shaking your head, I know you disagree. But, but, but, but my reporting would show otherwise."
170,MR. DIONNE: Keep going.
171,"MS. BURNETT: I--look, I, I, I think the problem is you have the fastest job creation in this
recovery than you have in any recession in 25 years, but it is still not enough. You aren't going
to win this on jobs, and that is the problem. It's going to take a long time. I don't know how
you get around that problem, but technically speaking, this recovery has not been tepid."
172,"MR. GREGORY: All right. We are going to leave it there. Obviously, it's going to be an
exciting next couple of months on the campaign trail. We'll be following it week in and week
out right here. And we'll be right back."
173,(Announcements)
174,"MR. GREGORY: That is all for today. We'll be back next week. If it's Sunday, it's MEET
THE PRESS."

7,"MR. GREGORY:  Can the White House do anything before November to put people back to work?  And who is right in the debate about your taxes? I'll explore the president's thinking and go inside the White House's campaign strategy with senior adviser to the president, David Axelrod."
8,"Then, nine years after 9/11, what is behind the new wave of anti-Muslim sentiment in America?  Has the president helped or hurt by wading into controversies about an Islamic community center and mosque in lower Manhattan and a Florida pastor's threats to burn the holy Quran?  An exclusive interview this morning with former mayor of New York City and
2008 presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani."
9,"Finally, our political roundtable weighs in on the legacy of the 9/11 attacks, religious tensions in America, and the economy.  Plus, the outlook for the midterm race.  With us, the best-selling author of ""No god But God:  The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam,"" Reza Aslan;
former White House press secretary to President Clinton, Dee Dee Myers of Vanity Fair magazine; Republican strategist Mike Murphy; and Ron Brownstein of the National Journal."
10,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS, with David Gregory."
11,MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.
12,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  After a weekend of start-and-stop announcements, news from Iran this morning that jailed American Sarah Shourd will, in fact, be released on $500,000 bail, along with her two friends, Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal.  She has been accused of spying and detained in a Tehran prison since last summer.  Joining me now from Des Moines, Iowa, the
president's top political adviser, David Axelrod."
13,"Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS, Mr. Axelrod."
14,"MR. DAVID AXELROD:  Thanks, David.  Good to be here."
15,"MR. GREGORY:  What about this news from, from Iran?  What do we know about when, in fact, she'll be released and will it, in fact, happen this time?"
16,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, that's the question.  Obviously, we're hopeful and we're encouraged by this news, but there have been starts and stops in this before, and until that actually happens, you know, we're on a wait-and-see basis."
17,"MR. GREGORY:  As far as Bauer and Fattal and their release, is there any progress there?"
18,"MR. AXELROD:  You know, David, I'm not going to comment on any of that right now because we're at a sensitive stage here.  Obviously, we're hopeful that we can get these folks out.  They should never have been in jail in the first place.  They're being held under false pretenses, and they should be released, and, and we're working very hard to see that
that happens."
19,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Let me turn to politics and the domestic agenda, particularly the economy.  The president has announced plans for some additional infrastructure spending to stimulate the economy, he also would like to give some business tax breaks that the corporate world has responded very favorably to.  Should these become law, should they get passed, what impact do you think they could actually have by November?"
20,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, I don't know that, that--look, the goal is, is not to have impact by November; the goal is to have impact and to get this economy moving again.  I know everybody's looking at this--in Washington--is looking at this election at the, at the economy through the prism of the election, but when people are sitting around their kitchen table, they're not looking at the NBC News poll, David, they're looking at bills they can't pay..."
21,MR. GREGORY:  What...
22,"MR. AXELROD:  ...they're concerned about their future, they want to know that we have policies that are not only going to get the economy accelerating in the short run but will lay a foundation for future growth..."
23,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, right, but so the White House has an economic strategy..."
24,MR. AXELROD:  ...and that's what the president is after.
25,"MR. GREGORY:  The White House has an economic strategy, but the White House is also tactical and is indeed looking at the November election when you announce some of these policies at a point when most people agree it's not going to get passed by November.  David Wessel in The Wall Street Journal wrote this in his column on Wednesday, let me put it up on
the screen, that ""Obamanomics Is Recast as `Recovery Summer' Fades.  On both politics and economics,"" he writes, ""the president's moves are late. There was ample warning earlier this year that economic recovery lacked vigor and that the oomph of fiscal stimulus was about to wane.  Had these policies been proposed in the spring, Congress might have adopted
them--and the economy would have been feeling the lift by now.  Instead, the president looks like he checked the economy""..."
26,MR. AXELROD:  Well...
27,"MR. GREGORY:  ...""off the to-do list prematurely, and instead turned to financial reform, energy, immigration, and"" the ""Middle East peace - and now regrets that."" Response?"
28,"MR. AXELROD:  I strongly disagree with that.  In fact, we've been doing things all along to accelerate this economy.  Earlier in the year, we passed a higher act to give additional tax breaks to people who hire--to firms that hire unemployed workers.  We passed a bill to keep teachers and firefighters and police who were going to lose their jobs on the job; it was important for the public, important for the economy.  And we've been trying for months, as you know, to pass additional tax breaks for small businesses on top of the eight we've given them and to expand lending.  That has been held up by politics in the United States Senate.
We're hopeful next week we may be able to break the log jam.  Senator Voinovich, a Republican, said it's time to stop playing games, he said to his own party, and we agree with that."
29,"So we've done things right along to keep this recovery moving in the right direction.  We've had eight straight months of, of positive job growth in the private sector.  We need to accelerate that pace, and that's the reason the president has proposed these additional ideas.
Whether they--we're ready to pass them tomorrow, David, if the Republican Party in the Senate allows it, if they pass the small business tax bill. And if they want to move on others, we're ready to go.  If they want to wait until after the election, then we'll have to wait until after the election."
30,"MR. GREGORY:  When you talk about the economic progress that has or has not been made, there's been some critics who have looked at how the president has talked about the economy, and, and we compiled some of what the president has said about the economy going back to last April.  Let's look at that."
31,"(Videotape, April 10, 2009)"
32,PRES. OBAMA:  What you're starting to see is glimmers of hope across the economy.
33,"(August 7, 2009) That's why we're turning this economy around.  I am convinced that we can see a light at the end of the tunnel."
34,"(August 8, 2009) This month's job numbers are a sign that we've begun to put the brakes on this recession.  The worst may be behind us. "
35,(End videotape)
36,"MR. GREGORY:  And here is what the White House--the Web site from the White House touted earlier in the summer, it was ""Recovery Summer,"" as it was billed by the White House in campaigning across the country, as the ""Administration kicks off Recovery Summer, Groundbreakings and Events Across the Country."" And yet here is the economic record, which is still quite bleak:  9.6 percent unemployment, you have had 19 months--or 16 months of straight--of 9 percent or higher unemployment; 54,000 net jobs lost in August; 14.9 million unemployed; 6.2 million of which are long-term unemployed.  And just today in The New York Times, a reminder of the real cost of this, a story that we see, ""As Economy Tumbles,
Numbers of Families in Shelters Rise."" You've had a rise in the number of families actually going into homeless shelters.  So it's a question of the president's rhetoric vs. reality; are those things out of sync?  "
37,"MR. AXELROD:  No, they're not out of sync.  And obviously in April, we were on a slightly greater scheme than we, we were over the summer because you had a Greek fiscal crisis that took 15 percent off the stock market and caused businesses to retrench further.  But the reality remains, David, that when we took office, we were losing 800,000 jobs, in the month of January, when we took over from the last administration.  We lost four million jobs in the last six months of the last administration. We've had eight months of private-sector job growth.  We have to accelerate."
38,"Listen, the hole that this recession created was huge, 8 million people lost, lost their jobs, and that's on top of a decade in which the middle class was treading water.  And there's a lot of pain out there and a lot of--and people are frustrated.  They deserve to be frustrated.  We're
frustrated.  We want to move this economy forward more quickly, we, we would like some cooperation to do it."
39,"But the real issue is, since you raised--put this in a political context, the real issue for people this November is going to be, what direction do we want to go?  Now the other side, and you had Pete Sessions on your show, the head of the congressional campaign committee for the
Republicans, said, ""We wan to go back to the very same agenda we had before this president took office."" That agenda was a disaster.  That agenda turned the Clinton surplus into a record deficit of $1.3 trillion, gave free rein to the special interests, and led to the biggest--at the
expense of the middle class and the economy--and led to the greatest economic collapse..."
40,MR. GREGORY:  Let me...
41,MR. AXELROD:  ...since the Great Depression.  Why would we want to go back to that?
42,"MR. GREGORY:  But let me ask you when you think, as a practical matter, when does the economic team think that Obama administration economic policies will have a sizable impact on the unemployment rate in this country?"
43,"MR. AXELROD:  David, there was a study that was released just a couple of weeks ago by a couple of economists, one Republican, one Democrat, some of the leading economists in the country, who said the things that we did not only saved--or created three and a half million jobs, in other words, three and a half more million people are working, but we would have
lost--if we hadn't taken all the steps we had taken, we would have lost twice as many jobs as we did during the recession.  I--the hole was tremendous, the damage is great. It took 10 years to create that problem..."
44,"MR. GREGORY:  Right, but my question is..."
45,MR. AXELROD:  ...it's going to take--nearly 10 years--it's going to take some time...
46,MR. GREGORY:  ...when is the expectation that the unemployment rate can come down in a meaningful way?
47,"MR. AXELROD:  ...it's going to take some time to fix it.  Well, we're, we're, we're, we're moving toward that with every step that we take. Obviously, 750,000 new private-sector jobs created this year is a start. We need to accelerate that, and it will come with growth.  That growth's
going to come with the steps we've taken, and it's going to come with a revitalization of the middle class, which is why, of course, we want to extend tax cuts for the middle class."
48,"MR. GREGORY:  But the, the, the fundamental belief of the American people has to be that things are going to get better.  This administration said that with the stimulus plan you'd have unemployment at 8 percent.  That proved not to be the case.  You've had some real big bites of the legislative apple here with successes--healthcare reform, financial regulation, a very large stimulus plan, which the president argued was necessary.  And yet, here we stand, the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, disapproval of the president's handling of the economy is at 56 percent.  But here is what is in, in many ways more damning than that, the judgment of whether people are optimistic about the future. And here it is, from the same poll, will things get better or worse or stay the same?  Fifty-one percent think they'll stay the same or get worse.  This was a president, Mr. Axelrod, who was, who was elected on the promise of transformation of Washington and better handling of the economy.  Isn't the lack of confidence in him on the economy the ultimate judgment that you were trying to avoid?"
49,"MR. AXELROD:  No.  Look, I'm not worried about the judgment of him, I'm worried about moving this economy forward.  That's what he's worried about. We walked into something that nobody anticipated.  We knew the situation was bad.  No one knew how bad it was.  It was the greatest downturn since the Great Depression.  And our job since that time is to work day in and day out to move that forward.  We are--the economy is growing now instead of shrinking, we're gaining jobs instead of losing them.  We have to accelerate that.  And yes, people are discouraged. They've gone through, not just a hard recession, but for many people
they've been treading water for, for a decade and, and, and, and salaries and wages have flatlined and so on.  But the, the answer is to do the array of things that we have to do to invest in our infrastructure, to give business the incentive to grow, to give middle-class people money to spend to get our economy moving again, to have the best educated work force, to do all the things to--to expand exports.  All the things that we're working on are going to move this economy forward.  But, of course, people are discouraged.  It's been a tough time."
50,"MR. GREGORY:  But if, if this is an election about choices..."
51,"MR. AXELROD:  I'll tell you--wait, I'll tell you..."
52,"MR. GREGORY:  Wait a minute, I'm sorry.  If..."
53,"MR. AXELROD:  Let me, let me, let me just say one thing.  Yeah."
54,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, this is the question of..."
55,MR. AXELROD:  Let's talk about the choices.
56,"MR. GREGORY:  If this is a question about choices, Americans have lost confidence in this president's direction to fix the economy."
57,"MR. AXELROD:  Listen, you look at your same poll, and I've looked at your poll, obviously, and the thing that people said that made them most uncomfortable with a candidate was whether they supported the economic policies of George W. Bush.  And you listen to--and the policies that existed before, before this president took office.  You listen to what John Boehner, the man who would be speaker, has said about what he wants to do about the economy.  He says he wants to restore those tax cuts for companies that ship our jobs overseas, he wants to cancel the Obama tax cuts that were part of the Recovery Act for the middle class and raise
taxes on 110 million families. And yet, he wants to borrow $700 billion to give millionaires and billionaires another tax cut and add to our deficits.  And then this morning we read that the lobbying community has rallied to his Boehner for Speaker campaign and spent millions of dollars so that they can go back to writing the rules themselves.  They say, ""We don't need to buy access to Mr. Boehner, we already have that."" "
58,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
59,"MR. AXELROD:  ""We want him in power so that we're in power."" We don't want to go back to the same policies and the same practices that drove our economy into a ditch, that punished the middle class, and that led us to this catastrophe.  We have to keep moving forward."
60,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, so let me ask you a more specific question about this debate about tax cuts, for instance.  You mentioned Leader Boehner for the Republicans, who is saying in an interview that, in fact, he would support the middle class tax cuts if--the extension of which, which is what the president wants.  He said on Friday, don't hold those hostage.  What I'm asking is, is there any room to compromise with Republicans to extend, even if it's for two years, as your formerly departed budget director called for, those on upper-income Americans, those tax cuts from the Bush era?"
61,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, if you read carefully what our budget director said, he said he'd prefer we didn't move forward on the upper-income tax cuts because he doesn't believe that they're really stimulative and he doesn't believe we can afford it, but he thought for political reasons we might have to accept it.  So, you know, that--let's, let's lay, let's lay that aside.  But Mr. Boehner, no one believes that Mr. Boehner--you know, they called the last set of tax cuts temporary.  They're going to continue.  I think we have to assume that they're going to keep pushing this forward. "
62,"But let me make one point clear.  What we're proposing is a tax cut for 100 percent of Americans up to $250,000 of their income.  So if you make under $250,000, you'd get a tax cut on all your income.  If you make more than that, you'd get it up to $250,000.  So if you're a millionaire, you'll get what everybody else gets up to $250,000.  Not the $100,000 a
year that Mr. Boehner wants to give it.  David, we just can't afford it. And really, what we ought to do is, as the president said, we agree on the middle-class tax cuts.  Let's not hold them hostage while we debate whether we're going to give this very small number of people at the top a, a tax cut that we can't afford."
63,"MR. GREGORY:  It was striking to me hearing the president on Friday, when he talked about the economy and the choice in this election, he did not mention anything in his opening remarks about healthcare reform, which he and you and others have, have billed as a signature achievement of this administration. In fact, you have said that once people know more about
health care, the more popular it will become.  And, in fact, we see reporting this week in Politico that, in fact, there aren't any Democrats who supported this who are out there touting that vote.  Only those who opposed it are touting it in the election. And it's striking because in
March, Senator Chuck Schumer was on the program, and this is what he said about health care."
64,"(Videotape, March 28, 2010)"
65,"SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  So I predict, David, by November those who voted for health care will find it an asset; those who voted against it will find it a liability."
66,(End videotape)
67,MR. GREGORY:  The opposite has turned out to be true. Why is it that the president has failed to win the argument about the benefits of healthcare reform?
68,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, first of all, I don't think health care is driving this election, David.  And I think the economy is driving this election. People have anxiety about that economy.  I'll tell you what they don't want, though. They don't want to go back to a..."
69,MR. GREGORY:  Then why did you do health care and spend so much of last year on health care?
70,"MR. AXELROD:  They don't want to go back.  They don't want, they don't, they don't--well, you know why we worked on health care, because health care was a huge--is and was a huge problem in this country in terms of the cost of it to people and the government, in terms of the relationship between people and their insurance companies.  No one wants to go back to a situation where, if you have a pre-existing medical condition, you, you can be deprived of coverage.  No one wants to go back to a situation where, if you get seriously ill, you can get thrown off your insurance. Seniors don't want to go back to paying more for their prescription
drugs.  No one's calling for that, David. And if the Republican Party wants to make the argument that that's what we should do, then they should make it openly and honestly."
71,"MR. GREGORY:  But this administration made the argument that part of economic recovery was passing healthcare reform, part of getting the economic fiscal house in order in the government was healthcare reform. "
72,MR. AXELROD:  Yes.
73,MR. GREGORY:  And yet Democrats are not campaigning on it because it's so politically toxic.  You said that wouldn't be the case.  You said it would get more popular...
74,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, listen."
75,MR. GREGORY:  ...not less.
76,"MR. AXELROD:  I, I think it, I think that health care over time is going to become more popular.  But people are focused on this economy right now. They've got anxiety about this economy.  That's what's, that's what's driving the vote right now, David.  And, at the end of the day you, you mention the fiscal, the Congressional Budget Office and every objective observer who's looked at it has said that this will save a trillion dollars over the course of the next couple of decades or more in our, in our--in budget deficits.  And that's an important part of this. So we have to think long as well as short."
77,"MR. GREGORY:  Before you go, Rahm Emanuel, chief of staff, whether he's eyeing the mayoral run in Chicago.  If he were to take some early steps toward that, maybe raise money, look into it, can he do that with the president's blessing while he's still chief of staff?"
78,"MR. AXELROD:  Well, I think the president's been clear that while the--Rahm is chief of staff, he's going to be focused on his duties as chief of staff. He's looking at it.  He loves the city of Chicago, there's no question about it.  And he's going to--and he has a hard decision to make because he has a, he has a lot of responsibilities here and he enjoys working with this president, he enjoys serving the country in this capacity.  But he's going to make a decision, and after he makes his decision, I'm sure that he'll make subsequent decisions about, about
when and, and, and--when it's appropriate to begin doing that campaigning."
79,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  David Axelrod, as always, thank you very much. Enjoy the steak fry this afternoon in Iowa."
80,MR. AXELROD:  Good to be with you.  Looking forward to it.  Thank you.
81,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
82,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We turn now to a Republican candidate for the 2008 presidential election and, of course, the mayor of New York City at the time of the September 11th attacks; Rudy Giuliani joins me now from 30 Rockefeller Plaza in the heart of Manhattan."
83,"Mr. Mayor, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS."
84,"MR. RUDY GIULIANI:  Good morning.  How, how are you, David?"
85,"MR. GREGORY:  I'm very well, thank you."
86,"I want to talk about a tumultuous week leading up to the ninth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.  As you look at the controversy surrounding what happened, this debate over the mosque and community center in lower Manhattan, the threat to burn the Quran by a Florida
pastor, and this anti-Muslim sentiment in the country on the ninth anniversary, what's happening?  What's behind that?"
87,"MR. GIULIANI:  I can't, I can't tell you exactly what's behind it.  I mean, something like this probably could have happened at any time. It's--these controversies happening right now I don't think necessarily are connected to each other.  But if you had told me, you know, four
years ago someone wants to put a mosque up near Ground Zero, I would have told you that 80, 90 percent of the family members would be very offended by that and very hurt by that for a whole host of reasons having nothing to do with Islamaphopia, but having all to do with how they feel this is sacred ground, that a Moslem center there would not be appropriate,
someplace else would be perfectly appropriate."
88,"If you had told me that people would have gotten very upset if somebody wanted to burn the Quran three, four, five years ago, same thing would have been the case.  So why these things are happening together right now, they could be connected, they could be unconnected.  And I analyze them both the same way. The, the imam has a right to put the mosque
there.  Freedom of religion gives him that right.  The minister has the right to burn the Quran.  The same amendment to the Constitution gives him that right, the First Amendment.  In either case, common sense and a real dedication to healing that these men of God would theoretically have, would tell you not to do it because you're hurting too many people."
89,"MR. GREGORY:  You mention Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, who is imam who wants to build a community center in lower Manhattan.  He appeared on CNN this week and, and issued a warning of sorts about this debate moving forward and its impact.  Let me play a portion of that."
90,MR. GIULIANI:  Yeah.
91,"(Videotape, Wednesday)"
92,"Imam FEISAL ABDUL RAUF:  If we move from that location, the story will be that the radicals have taken over the discourse.  The headlines in the Muslim world will be that Islam is under attack.  And I'm less concerned by the radicals in America than I'm concerned about the radicals in the Muslim word."
93,(End videotape)
94,MR. GREGORY:  Are you concerned about that warning?
95,"MR. GIULIANI:  I'm concerned about the imam doing that.  I think that tactic is not the kind of tactic I would have expected from an imam who's featured as a man of conciliation.  You know, I analyzed this imam's history pretty carefully, and I hate to simply it, but it's the only way
to do it.  There's the good imam and the bad imam.  The good imam is about reconciliation.  He's about being open and transparent about what he's doing and how he's doing it. Then there's the bad imam who said America is an accessory to September 11. America has more Muslim blood on its hands than vice versa.  He can't condemn Hamas as a terrorist group.
And he will not be transparent about where he's getting the money, how he's getting the money, and has virtually not been open at all about this.  And now we have the imam who tells us if doesn't get his way there could be significant and very dangerous violence.  Look, those are very, very strong words, and to enter a sort of a suggestion of a threat into this, I worry about this as the kind of tactics he, he pursues."
96,"MR. GREGORY:  You, you talked in rather stark terms, however, about moving forward with this community center and mosque, saying that if you are in fact committed to being a healer, you don't go forward with the project, but if you were a warrior you do.  Are you actually suggesting that he's a warrior..."
97,MR. GIULIANI:  No.  I'm...
98,MR. GREGORY:  ...because of his interest in building this?
99,"MR. GIULIANI:  I'm suggesting he's--seems to be--he seems, by his actions to be more interested in confrontation than in healing.  Actually, if you go on with the rest of the that quote, I was talking about the pope and the issue that he faced several years ago with a convent outside of Auschwitz.  There was a convent there, perfect right to have it.  Many
people in the Jewish people felt it was insensitive.  The pope and the nuns could have said, ""We're going to stay there.  We have a right to do it.  Let's have that confrontation.  Bring it on."" The pope, being a man of healing, wanting not to make things more painful for people that have already had way too much pain, said, ""Let's withdraw.  Let's pull it back."" I say he has the same kind of choice."
100,"The people he's hurting here most are the families of, of--the families that have lost loved ones down there.  And they don't all feel that way, but 80 or 90 percent feel extremely hurt by this.  It's making them relive the pain. They should be the ones to get the most consideration,
not the imam, not me, not the president, not the mayor.  They're the ones that are the most affected by this."
101,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me move on to the legacy of the 9/11 attacks and our war over two administrations now against terrorism.  You said back in 2001, after 9/11, ""I think the sooner and the faster we find Osama [bin,] bin Laden..."""
102,MR. GIULIANI:  Right.
103,"MR. GREGORY:  ""...then the safer the world is going to be."" He still has not been captured.  He's an iconic figure, for sure.  Is he more than that?  Are we not safe after 9/11 until he's captured? "
104,"MR. GIULIANI:  Well, I, I would still say the same thing.  The fact is, we will not be safe even after he is captured.  There's a little more symbolism to it now than there would have been then.  There was a little more reality to it then.  But, but by that I mean at that time he was
much more active and had much more flexibility to conduct further attacks.  We've kind of pinned him down a lot more.  Efforts of both the Bush and the Obama administration, I think, in this area have been both effective in kind of circling him in.  But there is a tremendous symbolic value in catching him and bring him to justice, including his ability to
recruit.  And, you know, the--in any war--and however you want to describe this war, it's a different kind of war, but it's a war--you capture a significant leader and you have affected the morale of the other side, and maybe that's even more exaggerated in a situation like
this."
105,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to ask you more generally about America's fight against terrorists.  And there's a provocative view by Ted Koppel, former anchor of ABC New's ""Nightline,"" that's out in The Washington Post this morning.  I want to put a portion of it on the screen.  He writes:  ""Nine years after 9/11, let's stop playing into bin Laden's hands.  The goal of any of organized terrorist attack,"" he writes, ""is to goad a vastly more powerful enemy into an excessive response.  And over the past nine years, the U.S. has blundered into the 9/11 snare with one overreaction after another.  Bin Laden deserves to be object of our hostility, national
anguish, and contempt, but much of what he has achieved we have done, and continue to do, to ourselves.  Bin Laden does not deserve that we, even inadvertently, fulfill so many of his unimagined dreams.  ...  Through the initial spending of a few hundred thousand dollars, training and then sacrificing 19 of his foot soldiers, bin Laden has watched his relatively
tiny and all but anonymous organization of a few hundred zealots turn into the most recognized international franchise since McDonald's.  Could any enemy of the United States have achieved more with less?"" How do you respond to that?"
106,"MR. GIULIANI:  Well, it's, it's--there's a bit of a, of a policy problem for the United States here that if, you know, if you do, you're damned and if you don't, you're damned.  The reality is, in the period of time when we weren't paying as much attention to bin Laden and al-Qaeda, they
were attacking us almost every other year.  I'm talking about in the, in the '90s, culminating in the attack of the USS Cole, in which we didn't respond because we weren't clear enough about who the, who the enemy were.  Since we've had those kind of change in policy, call, call it
going on offense against Islamic terrorism, which Bush began and which, in the case of Afghanistan, the Obama administration, and I support them in this, are, are continuing, at home, at least, we've been able to avoid a repetition of the September 11 attack, which I have to tell you, nine years ago today, which would have been the day after September 11, when I was still mayor, I was being briefed we were going to be attacked numerous times.  So I can't tell you all the reasons that we haven't been attacked in the way in which everyone predicted, but I think part of it is that big response that Ted is, is talking about.  That's keeping them on defense.  And I wouldn't, wouldn't pull that away without analyzing it
very closely because, in my view, the more you have Islamic extremism on defense, the safer we are.  The more you give them room to plan, maneuver, and work out a tax, the more dangerous we are."
107,"MR. GREGORY:  The president said on Friday this is a threat that will be with the United States for a long time, but he said something notable, it doesn't have to dominate our foreign policy.  Do you agree or disagree with that?"
108,"MR. GIULIANI:  Agree with that completely.  And it better not dominate our foreign policy because this is an enemy.  It's a significant enemy, but it's not an enemy like Nazism and communism in a sense that it is a worldwide conflagration.  It can create horrible attacks, maybe worse than Nazis or communists, like September 11 was the worse attack in our
history.  But it's not an all-encompassing enemy; and therefore, we have to be able to deal with it with strength, but we also have to be equally willing to give attention to the issues with Asia, the issues with Africa, the issues with, with Europe, South America.  We can't have
people in South America feeling that we're not paying attention to South America because we're so concentrated on this terrorism issue.  And there's a--that's a real difficult thing for both the Bush administration, the Obama administration, or any administration to carry
out."
109,MR. GREGORY:  I want to ask you a quick...
110,"MR. GIULIANI:  But I'm, I'm, I'm glad the president said that because that becomes like a warning to his administration, please pay attention to these other things with equal force."
111,"MR. GREGORY:  Finally, I want to ask you a political question, an economic question.  Back in 2004 on this program, this is a comment you made about your Republican Party."
112,"(Videotape, March 7, 2004)"
113,MR. GIULIANI:  The Republican Party is a much bigger tent than people give it credit for.  We have a lot of what I guess you all call moderate Republicans.
114,(End videotape)
115,MR. GREGORY:  Do you still think that's the case?
116,"MR. GIULIANI:  I love when you go back.  I love, boy, you can find me saying almost any--I think, you probably find, find me contradicting everything I said today on your show at one time in the past. "
117,MR. GREGORY:  But do you believe that that is still case for the Republican Party?  Do you think Republicans as a minority party in Washington have acted constructively and responsibility during this president's administration?
118,"MR. GIULIANI:  I do.  I do because the president gave them not much choice. I think Republicans did suggest changes in health care that the president rejected out of hand.  I'm pretty, pretty, I'm pretty conversant with that debate.  Like, for example, tort reform.  If the
president had of included tort reform, which he took off the table immediately in health care, he probably could have gotten eight, 10 Republicans, you know, on board.  I, I had dinner the other night with..."
119,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But that, but hold on, but hold on, Mr. Mayor, that's a big assumption and that's a much bigger debate.  My more narrow question is whether you think what you said in 2004 holds, which is, is the Republican Party still a big tent party with moderate Republicans in its ranks?"
120,MR. GIULIANI:  I'm still here.
121,MR. GREGORY:  But you tried to run for president...
122,MR. GIULIANI:  I'm still here.
123,"MR. GREGORY:  ...and you couldn't do it successfully.  Do you think that the tide has turned in the Republican Party, and it's become something different?"
124,"MR. GIULIANI:  No, I think the Republican Party has always had this tension, as the Democratic Party has, which you have a, a group of people that are significantly ideological, and then you have other people that are more center, center right.  And I think we have a significant number of those. We've got candidates running right now that are easily described that way.  So I think we're, we're, we're as broad a political party, if not broader than the Democratic Party, just in a different political spectrum."
125,MR. GREGORY:  Who's the most dominant voice in the Republican Party today?
126,"MR. GIULIANI:  Probably--right, right today, the next couple of months, John Boehner would be the most, most prevalent voice because he's the one that has the best chance of becoming a national leader in an official way over the next two to three months."
127,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  I have to try to pin you down before you go on this point:  The standings are a little tight in the American League East after the Yankees...
128,MR. GIULIANI:  Yeah.
129,"MR. GREGORY:  ...dropped a game to the Rangers last night, up by half a game over the Rays.  What's going to happen here, Mr. Mayor?"
130,"MR. GIULIANI:  Well, I have to confess to you, my wife went to high school with the manager of the, of the Rays, so this is an issue even in my home.  I think we take it.  I think we're going to be in the playoffs with them, so we're--one way or the other, we're, we're the winner and
they're the wild card or they're the winner and we're the wild card.  And we're going to be playing five or seven games with them and I think our experience and our pitching staff and our playoff-hardened players like, like Mariano and Jeter and A-Rod, I think we win."
131,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Mr. Mayor, we'll leave it there.  Thank you very much."
132,MR. GIULIANI:  All right.
133,"MR. GREGORY:  And up next, the legacy of the 9/11 attacks, religious tensions in America, the economy, and the outlook for the midterm race. Our roundtable weighs in on all of it.  Author of ""No god But God:  The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam,"" Reza Aslan; former White House

136,(Announcements)
137,"MR. DAVID GREGORY:  We are back and joined now by our roundtable.  A lot to get to with author of the best-selling book ""No god But God:  The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam,"" Daily Beast contributor Reza Aslan; editorial director for the National Journal Group, Ron Brownstein; Republican strategist Mike Murphy, all the way in from L.A.; and former
Clinton White House press secretary and contributing editor to Vanity Fair, Dee Dee Myers."
138,"Welcome, all of you."
139,"I want to talk politics, I want to talk the economy, but I do want to talk about 9/11 and this tumultuous week, a surreal week in many ways, with the threats from the Florida pastor and this ongoing debate about what's going on in lower Manhattan.  And, and we look at this, the views of Islam in The Washington Post poll, unfavorable now at 49 percent. Look at that, eclipsing even the unfavorable rating in October of 2001. And you look at the, the flag burnings, some of the reactions that we've seen to the debate we've been having here going on in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, in Pakistan, burning flags, you see this kind of thing.
This is a hearts and minds campaign that General Petraeus is waging in Afghanistan and elsewhere in Pakistan, and there are setbacks to it."
140,"Reza, you wrote this as part of an NPR commentary at the end of the summer, ""The fear is that this [Islamaphobia] may lead to the same kind of radicalization among Muslim youth in the U.S. that we've seen in Europe.  It has already played into the hands of al-Qaeda, which has for years been trying to convince American Muslims that the unfettered religious freedoms they enjoy is a mirage.  ...  Are we in danger of proving al-Qaeda right?  I am a liberal, progressive, secularized American Muslim.  But when I see that bigotry against my faith - my very identity - has become so commonplace in America that it is shaping into a wedge issue for the midterm elections, I can barely control my anger.  I can't imagine how the next generation of American Muslim youth will react to such provocations."" What's behind this?"
141,"MR. REZA ASLAN:  Well, look, I think part of it has to do with the controversy surrounding the Islamic community center in lower Manhattan. And while it's true that there are those who oppose the project because they do believe that it will disturb the sensitivities of some 9/11
victims--though I, I, I do want to remind everyone that in this country we do not define our constitutional rights by how they disturb people's sensitivities--you only had to spend a few minutes at Ground Zero yesterday and to take in this international cabal of anti-Muslim zealots
that had gathered together to spout the most vile racist bigotry to know that this is about something more. Anti-Muslim sentiment in this country is at unprecedented levels.  We all know this.  But what's truly disturbing is how mainstream it's becoming with politicians on both
sides--and I would have to include the former mayor in this, in this category--openly and explicitly associating American Muslims with al-Qaeda.  I mean, what I'd like to know from, not just the former mayor but from, you know, the people who, who keep talking about this Islamic
community center, is that what is it that this multifaith, multistoried community center being led by an American imam that two presidents, Republican and Democrat, have used as a--as an ambassador to the Muslim world, cultural ambassador to the Muslim world, what does that have to do with al-Qaeda?  The answer is kind of simple, actually:  Islam.  But let's call a spade a spade for a moment.  If you are painting 1.5 billion people with the same brush of violence and, and, and extremism, you're a  bigot.  And I think what's, what's disturbing is the way that that's become part of the, the, the natural discourse now."
142,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, and it's become, Ron, it's become politicized, 9/11 has..."
143,MR. RON BROWNSTEIN:  Absolutely.
144,"MR. GREGORY:  ...in these debates in a way that, I mean, 9/11 has been politicized in different ways, you can argue, since then, but in a different way now."
145,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  We have a lot of threats tangled together here.  Both President Bush and President Obama, for the reasons you cited in your article, have said that--have viewed it in our interest to make clear, and no one more forcefully than President Obama in the last few days, that the U.S. is at war with terror, but we're not at war with Islam. That has been viewed as essential to send that message to the world.  I think the, the lesson that we're seeing in this controversy over the mosque is that not all Americans agree.  And, in fact, with President Bush out of office, Bush expressing those sentiments sort of suppressed that kind of argument in the Republican Party. If you look at polling that came out recently by Time magazine, a plurality of Republicans said that a Muslim should not be allowed to run for president."
146,"Now, the flip side of this is that to some extent this sentiment is being driven by what you're describing perhaps already happening.  The successor to the Kean-Hamilton group, the 9/11 commission, the National Security Preparedness Group, came out with a, a powerful study this week that talked about these individual, one-off cases of terrorism really being part of a new pattern in terms of becoming the major security threat to the U.S., and that in many cases it is radicalized American Muslims.  Still a fringe element of the, of the overall population, but
nonetheless real.  And things like the Times Square and the, and the Texas shooter, those kinds of things fuel the sentiment on the other side, which may, in fact, produce kind of a downward spiral here."
147,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Dee Dee Myers, is some of this the demonization of the other because of what the country's going through right now?  I mean, we are in an economic situation, as I pointed out, it's on the cover--front page of The New York Times, more and more families going into homeless shelters.  I mean, this is just not a policy debate about taxes and spending, this is about real impact on real lives around the country.  Is that in part what's fueling this?  And can President Obama make a gesture like going to a mosque, saying he--that's something he admired about what President Bush did, saying that it's not a war against Islam.  Can he do
something like that?"
148,"MS. DEE DEE MYERS:  Well, there's no question that throughout our history when times have been bad and economic declines and depression or in times when we're--we've been at war we've been susceptible to vilifying some group of people, whether it's, you know, interning the
Japanese--Japanese-Americans during World War II, or many other instances across our history.  So that's no question that there--that that's fueling it."
149,"The other thing that's fueling it and that is so disturbing is that certain people saw political opportunity in fueling it.  People are economically uncertain.  But there's political opportunity, and that's why we're seeing the politicization yesterday for the first time in nine years of the commemoration of 9/11.  And so, you know, you have sort of economic downturn meets political opportunity, and it's created this really unfortunate..."
150,"MR. GREGORY:  Isn't it true, Mike Murphy, though, that, you know, Rudy Giuliani, in the past several months, has been so critical of this administration's orientation toward fighting the war on terror, and yet now he's agreeing with President Obama when he says it can't dominate our
foreign policy?  There's no substantive opposition to what the Democrats are doing right now in terms of fighting terrorists."
151,"MR. MIKE MURPHY:  No, no.  I--look, I think the country's united in fighting terror.  You can argue about the tactics, you can argue about foreign policy emphasis because there are a lot of other problems in the world, rise in China, many things."
152,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
153,"MR. MURPHY:  But yeah, Islamofascism is something there's a national consensus on.  And I think that's part of the problem with this debate now on, on Islam.  The elections aren't about Islam.  But one of the problems is, I think there becomes a phony moral equivalence that
sometimes we hold ourselves on a nutty standard to.  Many of our enemies are places where the state, they're theocracies.  So religion is a weapon to them.  We're trying to still be a civil society.  And so I, I think we have to be careful to keep our consensus of, of no bigotry.  Some nut in Florida with a press release and a Bic lighter becomes a moon launch.  I
blame the media for some of that.  There ought to be control on the oxygen on all this.  But I think we are still a very tolerant country, and we're the good guys in this."
154,"MR. GREGORY:  Let's talk a little bit more about the midterms and, and, and the economic power of this recession.  Dee Dee Myers, I take you back to 1993 and the documentary ""The War Room."" This was James Carville--while we have that, first we'll show you this, which is seven out of 10 Americans know somebody who his currently out of work in this recession.  This is the, the poll that the National Journal, Ron Brownstein's group, has worked on.  But this was ""The War Room,"" and this was that famous message from James Carville back then."
155,(Videotape)
156,"MR. JAMES CARVILLE:  Stay focused.  Talk about things that matter to people, you know?  It's the economy, stupid."
157,(End videotape)
158,"MR. GREGORY:  ""It's the economy, stupid."" Here we are again."
159,MS. MYERS:  Right.
160,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet people's connection to the recession, people who've been laid off, is the president connecting on this issue?"
161,"MS. MYERS:  I, I think he's trying to.  But I, I think the results sort of speak for themselves.  He's having trouble connecting on, on it.  He's having trouble making people believe that he's done enough.  And he, he starts every conversation by saying, ""Look, we've done a lot, but we
haven't gotten where we need to be, and we need to keep working."" And people are frustrated.  You know, one of the things Clinton--in 1994 we had a terrible midterm, lost both houses of Congress.  And the economy was improving, and yet people were still feeling..."
162,MR. GREGORY:  Right.  And that's a key point here...
163,MS. MYERS:  ...vulnerable.
164,"MR. GREGORY:  ...because part of the problem in '94--you've talked about it, Ron--the chaos theory.  Democrats couldn't get anything done.  Mike Murphy..."
165,MS. MYERS:  Yeah.
166,"MR. GREGORY:  ...Democrats have gotten a whole lot done, right?"
167,MS. MYERS:  Well...
168,"MR. GREGORY:  Financial reform, healthcare reform, a big stimulus.  I mean, this is a point I was, I was asking David Axelrod about.  There is a lack of confidence now after they've seen what the president has done..."
169,MR. MURPHY:  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.
170,MR. GREGORY:  ...in things getting better.
171,"MR. MURPHY:  Well, yeah.  I think they've gotten a lot of things done, they haven't gotten a lot of results that the American people have been--think have been effective.  So what happened when the president ran as a centrist and then became kind of a more doctrinaire, you know, liberal, particularly with the House Democratic definition of that, he's lost the country.  He's lost the independents, he's lost some of the working class, you know, white voters he had.  People now think that, after two years of almost complete power in Washington--I mean, he's had more power than many presidents have had because he's had all the houses, he's had a tremendous mandate, he hasn't delivered. People are feeling
more pain, and so they want a change, and so the data's pretty clear that there's going to be a change.  Now, we don't know the scope, but... "
172,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Ron Brownstein, here's a sense of history.  We'll put it up on the screen.  Midterm history for first-term presidents, it's mostly pretty bleak..."
173,MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Yes.
174,"MR. GREGORY:  ...for a president in power, as we see it revealed here.  A lot of losses across the board in our recent history; 2002 the exception after 9/11.  What's happening here?"
175,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Pretty wide distribution there.  Well, I think the first thing I learned this morning is an absolute rule of politics when you rule--from your interview with David Axelrod, which is if you're at 9.6 percent unemployment and it's not going down, there's not a good answer to any question.  And, in fact, people are--we're looking at over 60 percent of the country saying we're on the wrong track.  What's really changed in the last few months is not people's report of their own current circumstances, what's really changed is their level of optimism about the future.  And you, you talked about the NBC/Wall Street Journal
poll and our Heartland Moderate poll down from 55 percent saying the economy's going to get better over the next year.  Seventy percent were saying that in the spring.  That is the real cloud hanging over Democrats, and it could be very bad."
176,"I would say quickly, though, there are two distinct strains of disenchantment that are emerging here.  There is an ideological backlash going on in around 40, 40-something percent, low 40 percent of the electorate.  Beyond that, Obama has a problem with performance and
result.  And that is affecting, as Mike said, even groups that were into the core of his coalition in 2008 and are not necessarily drawn toward these Republican solutions.  So if they have any hope of avoiding full-scale disaster in November, which seems to be diminishing, it
may--it really is in trying to make this more of a choice than a referendum, which is difficult to do in a midterm election."
177,"MR. GREGORY:  Reza, healthcare reform.  I brought this up with Axelrod as well.  They have not won the argument there.  You can look at the polling. John Podhoretz wrote this in The New York Times--the New York Post, rather, on Friday, which I thought was interesting.  ""The [Health Care] bill united the GOP in opposition, gave a party in sore need of a defining issue its marching orders for the next several years.  And even before its passage, it landed a Republican in Teddy Kennedy's Senate seat whose central campaign promise was doing what he could to prevent it from happening."" I mean, this was a signature achievement.  Really tough if you're a president and Democrats who can't run on that achievement in the
midterms."
178,"MR. ASLAN:  They didn't win the, the, the argument over health care, they didn't win the argument over financial reform, and obviously, the president wants to make this election about either moving forward or moving backward. But, as Ron was saying, most people feel like we're,
we're actually standing perfectly still.  So they don't see either backwards, forward as the two options.  And, you know, there's not a lot of room here for the Democrats to, to think about this."
179,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, so, Dee Dee, eight weeks, what can the president do to save the House?"
180,"MS. MYERS:  Well, I think he can--first of all, he's going to have to contribute to the Democratic effort to target pretty carefully.  And it's a, it's a brutal and ugly time in, in the party when you have to triage. I think he can raise money, which he's already done quite effectively. And I think he can campaign in a few select districts, but, you know,
that isn't the silver bullet.  He isn't going to be able to save the House by campaigning for various members, although he can save, if they target carefully, they can save a few members.  They can spend a little more money to help save more.  And he can focus on the economy, as we've seen him do more aggressively, particularly this week."
181,"MR. GREGORY:  But--Mark--Mike, you said on this program last year, you described the Republican Party as Russia 1919.  I don't forget these quotes. You said..."
182,MR. MURPHY:  I said a lot of warlords were running around.  Yeah.
183,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Twenty warlords of the Republican Party are running around...
184,MR. MURPHY:  Yeah.
185,MR. GREGORY:  ...and nobody is really in charge.
186,MR. MURPHY:  Yeah.
187,"MR. GREGORY:  Is that still the case, or do you think Republicans have united in a way that can really return them to power and have them be effective?"
188,"MR. MURPHY:  Well, they don't need to unite to return to power because President Obama has become a great savior.  If he'd stayed in the center, he could have put us back for a long time.  Instead, he went hard left. Now there's been a reaction to his policies across the board and they're going to lose.  Now, I've been telling Republicans to brag a little less and organize a little more.  Let's not get the expectations out of control.  But every poll now is historic, and I think the only thing the president can do is build a time machine and go back in time to save an outcome that I don't know how bad it'll be for the Democrats, but people are mad.  They don't believe this administration has delivered, nor their allies in Congress.  They want a change.  It's going to be a different Washington."
189,"MR. GREGORY:  I, I want to look at one specific race that, of course, you have a connection to, that's out in California.  We all have California connections.  I'm an L.A.  native.  We can go around the table, we all have a California connection.  The governor's race in California, Mike
Murphy, you're working with Meg Whitman, the Republican, former head of eBay.  And here's the poll, it's a tight race.  She's ahead 2 percentage points over Attorney General Jerry Brown, a former governor, of course. This is, Ron Brownstein, a tight race in a state in a lot of economic
trouble. "
190,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  Right, absolutely it is, and has, and has been the iggest blue state in the country, overwhelming margin for President Obama."
191,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
192,"MR. BROWNSTEIN:  I believe he won by more than Lyndon Johnson did in 1964. But, look, it is easier for a Republican to win at the statewide level than it is at the federal level because some of these polarizing social issues and wedge issues like abortion and gun control that could
trip up Carly Fiorina, at the state level, aren't--at the federal level, aren't is relevant in state elections.  And Meg Whitman also has steered a more centrist course on them. On the other hand, she has spent a lot of money this summer and not put away Jerry Brown.  I'd say--you have to say she's the favorite, but the fact that he is hanging around where he is with all the negatives that he carries shows that he is, he is really in this."
193,"MR. GREGORY:  What's your view of the race, Mike?"
194,"MR. MURPHY:  I think Meg's going to win because she fits California well. I mean, look, the election..."
195,MR. ASLAN:  (Unintelligible)
196,"MR. MURPHY:  The election is not--yeah, no, I, she..."
197,MR. ASLAN:  (Unintelligible)
198,"MR. MURPHY:  It's a jobs program, and she's contributed to it.  People know she knows how to create jobs.  That's the number one issue.  And they know she's from the Silicon Valley world of delivering results, which is what we need in Sacramento.  Jerry Brown is a time machine to
failure."
199,"MR. ASLAN:  My question, Mike, is, why does Meg what to be governor of California?  Why would anyone want to be governor of California? "
200,MR. MURPHY:  Because...
201,MS. MYERS:  Let alone spend 140 million of their own money to get it.
202,"MR. MURPHY:  Yeah, but the money is about getting--California is so expensive, $3 million a week for television, it's about getting a message out against the entrenched public employee unions. "
203,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
204,"MR. MURPHY:  I'm mean, I'm flaking but I believe it.  I live there.  I care about it."
205,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, we got to leave it there.  We'll see what happens. We'll be watching in California and around the country.  Thanks to everybody. We'll be right back after this brief station break."

6,"Announcer:  From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory."
7,"MR. GREGORY:  Good morning.  Social conservative activists gathered this weekend in Washington for their annual Values Voters Summit, attracting a field of potential 2012 Republican candidates.  Congressman Mike Pence of Indiana got an early nod, winning their straw poll for president.  Sarah Palin finished fifth but did not attend, opting to keynote a Republican event in Iowa, where she continued to rally the GOP behind tea party candidates who have prevailed this primary season, leaving the Republican establishment reeling."
8,The midterm primaries are over and the tea party won.
9,"(Videotape, Tuesday)"
10,"MS. CHRISTINE O'DONNELL:  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.  When the government fears the people, there is liberty."
11,(End videotape)
12,"MR. GREGORY:  Christine O'Donnell's triumph in Delaware was the latest example of the purge inside the GOP.  Incumbents, moderates, members of the establishment are gone or have left the party.  The message is stop spending, stop taxing, stop borrowing."
13,"(Videotape, May 18, 2010)"
14,DR. RAND PAUL:  We've come to take our government back.
15,(End videotape)
16,MR. GREGORY:  GOP leaders in Washington are riding a tiger.  Some seasoned Republican voices fear it will cost the party.
17,"(Videotape, Tuesday)"
18,"MR. KARL ROVE:  I got to tell you, we--I--I'm--we, we were, we were looking at eight to nine seats in the Senate; we're now looking at seven to eight in my opinion.  This is not a race we're going to be able to win."
19,(End videotape)
20,MR. GREGORY:  But others inside the party counter the energy behind the tea partiers requires the GOP to adjust to a new reality.
21,(Videotape)
22,SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX):  I think Republicans better be very inclusive and open their arms and their minds to the message they're hearing from the grass roots across the country.
23,(End videotape)
24,"MR. GREGORY:  Led by Sarah Palin, who's emerged as a kingmaker this election season, the tea party may help get out conservative and independent voters in the fall.  But what's the longer term impact?"
25,(Videotape)
26,"MR. JONATHAN MARTIN:  They're demanding purity from the party.  And when it comes to general elections, that means they can nominate candidates that aren't necessarily going to appeal to the broad center of the electorate."
27,(End videotape)
28,"MR. GREGORY:  And that is the big question for the Republican Party:  Can they win in 2010 and even in 2012 without a bigger tent?  Joining me now, a man who has served this country under four presidents, most recently, of course, as secretary of State under President George W. Bush, General Colin Powell."
29,Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
30,"GEN. COLIN POWELL (Ret.):  Good morning, David.  Thank you."
31,MR. GREGORY:  There is so much going on.  I want to start with politics.  You heard that setup.  What do you make of what's happened in the Republican Party this week?
32,"GEN. POWELL:  I think the tea party movement--and at this point I think it's still a movement and not a party with an agenda--has tapped into an anxiety and an anger that exist throughout the country.  And they are not just mad at President Barack Obama and his administration, they're mad at, mad at Democrats and they're mad at incumbent Republicans.  And so I think it is a fascinating change in our political life to see this kind of movement gain such momentum and strength.  And this is good.  People want to see this.  But at the same time, this movement doesn't become a real force unstill it--until it starts to talk to the issues.  I want to cut spending.  I want to have lower taxes.  But how do you do that?  You can't just have slogans, you can't just have catchy phrases.  You have to have an agenda.  And I think what the Republican Party has to do, if it's going to incorporate the tea party efforts in it, is to come up with an agenda that the American people can see, touch, and actually believe in, and something they believe in."
33,"MR. GREGORY:  Mayor Bloomberg called the tea party movement, in The New York Times in an interview this morning, a fad akin to what Ross Perot was advocating back in 1992.  Do you see it that way?"
34,"GEN. POWELL:  It may well be a fad unless it converts itself from a movement into something that is a real political organization that takes stands on positions.  Right now what do they really believe in?  We all believe in the Constitution, we all want lower taxes, we all want less spending, lower deficit, everything else, more freedom.  But, at the same time, how do you get all of that and at the same time make sure that we are investing in our children, investing our infrastructure?  How do we bring the deficit down by cutting spending, and where do we cut that spending?  It's not enough to just say, ""Let's do it."" You got to have more than slogans."
35,"MR. GREGORY:  It--this time about a year ago you were in a, a feud with former Vice President Cheney, with Rush Limbaugh, about the nature of the Republican Party.  And this is what you said in May of 2009:  ""Rush Limbaugh says, `Get out of the Republican Party.'"" He was talking to you.  ""Dick Cheney says, `He's already out,'"" speaking about you.  ""I may be out of their version of the Republican Party, but there's another version of the Republican Party waiting to emerge once again."" That was a year ago.  Is the tea party what you had in mind?"
36,"GEN. POWELL:  Well, I have to point out that Mr. Cheney pulled that comment back a few weeks later and thought maybe I should stay in the party if I chose to remain in the party.  I'm kind of like a Mike Bloomberg in that he has shifted back and forth.  I consider myself a moderate Republican.  I have very, very moderate social views, and I'm pretty strong on, on defense matters.  And, and I think there is a party in there that wants to come out. But if the Republican Party's going to come out in the way that Mike Bloomberg is talking about and others are talking about, they've got to take a hard look at some of the positions they've been taking.  We can't be anti-immigration, for example, because immigrants are fueling this country.  Without immigrants, America would be like Europe or Japan with an aging population and no young people coming in to take care of it.  We have to educate our immigrants.  The Dream Act is one way we can do this.  That's before the Congress this coming week."
37,MR. GREGORY:  Explain that a little bit because that's an important piece of legislation.
38,"GEN. POWELL:  The Dream Act, in a nutshell, says if you are a young person and you were brought here by your parents and you're in illegal status, if you have finished high school, and we will give you a six-year temporary residency, and if, during those six years, you finish two years of college or you go into the military service for two years, then you're on a path to citizenship.  That's good.  America is going to be a minority nation in one more generation.  Our minorities are not getting educated well enough now. Fifty percent of our minority kids are not finishing high school.  We've got to invest in education.  We should use the Dream Act as one way to do it. Whether it should be part of the defense bill or not is something that Congress will decide."
39,"MR. GREGORY:  And yet, Republicans on the campaign trail are already talking about immigration in a rather hard-line way.  Former Governor Romney speaking about it at that Values Voter Summit, talking about it recently."
40,"(Videotape, September 17, 2010)"
41,"FMR. GOV. MITT ROMNEY:  We have serious enemies and growing threats around the world.  Unfortunately, we have an administration whose idea of a rogue state is Arizona."
42,(End videotape)
43,MR. GREGORY:  And what's happening in Arizona is something that's animating the Republicans right now.
44,"GEN. POWELL:  The American people want their borders to be protected. There's nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing wrong with making sure that people come across our borders, particularly our southern border, in a legal, safe manner.  But, at the same time, we have millions and millions of illegal immigrants in our country, undocumented individuals, who are working, who are doing things we need done in this country.  They're all over at my house doing things whenever I call for repairs, and I'm sure you've seen them at, at your house.  We've got to find a way to bring these people out of the darkness and give them some kind of status.  In the next few years, we will discover that, between the ages of 15 and 64, the working ages of our people, most of those are going to be kept in that age group because of immigration and the children of immigrants, whereas in other parts of the world the age of the population's getting older and fewer people are working.  So I'm telling you and I'm telling all of my, my, my citizens around the country is that immigration is what's keeping this country's lifeblood moving forward.  They enrich our culture with every generation.  And we have to find a way to protect our borders but, at the same time, treat our immigrant population with respect and dignity and give them a path to citizenship."
45,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me talk a little bit more about the status of the Republican Party and ask you, most directly, you still consider yourself a Republican?"
46,GEN. POWELL:  Yes.  Why shouldn't I?
47,MR. GREGORY:  Have you thought about leaving the party at any point?
48,"GEN. POWELL:  No, not really, because I still think that there is a need for a two-party system and that the Republican Party still has strength in it.  It has strength with respect to its feelings about foreign policy and defense policy and our place in the world, and I'm not happy with the rightward switch, shift that the party has taken, and I've said this on many occasion, said it in 2008 on this program.  And so I'm not about to give up.  I think that we will see what happens in this election and what happens over the next two years as we head into 2012 as to what kind of party is actually going to be running as opposed to just being a movement."
49,"MR. GREGORY:  As you well know, one of the most animating forces right now in the party is Sarah Palin.  I made a reference to her.  She was at a Ronald Reagan dinner in Iowa over the weekend.  She's campaigning across the country, advocating across the country, as she did in Delaware, which helped Christine O'Donnell get elected.  Some Republicans think that has hurt the seat.  What is her impact right now on the Republican Party, and does it bother you?"
50,"GEN. POWELL:  She's a star.  Why--it doesn't bother me.  I mean, she is out there mixing it up, she's conveying her views, she's animating people to come forward and participate in the political process.  I didn't think she was ready to be president of the United States in 2008, and I'm not sure she would be in 2012.  But there's nothing wrong with former Governor Palin getting out there, presenting her views and animating American political life.  People seem to suggest or think that this is something new and wild.  But if you look at our history, we have had movements like this throughout our history.  We've had this kind of political fighting throughout our history.  It's the nature of our democratic system.  One of the problems that I'm having with all of it right now is that there is a certain undercurrent of, of thought that is not helpful.  When people want to attack the president, attack him.  Presidents are used to being attacked.  But let's not go down low."
51,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
52,GEN. POWELL:  Let's not go down and start saying...
53,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let me give you one example of that."
54,GEN. POWELL:  Yeah.
55,"MR. GREGORY:  Because Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House, has made some references to a book that's out called ""The Roots of Obama's Rage,"" and this is in part what he had to say--I'll put it up on the screen--to the National Review.  ""What if [Obama] is so outside our comprehension, that only if you understand Kenyan, anti-colonial behavior, can you begin to piece together [his actions]?  That is the most accurate, predictive model for his behavior.  This is a person who is fundamentally out of touch with how the world works, who happened to have played a wonderful con, as a result of which he is now president."" What is this?"
56,"GEN. POWELL:  I would, I would just tell my, my fellow Americans think carefully about what was just said.  Think carefully about some of the stuff that is coming across the blogs and the airwaves.  Let's make a couple of points.  One, the president was born in the United States of America.  Let's get rid of that one, let's get rid of the birth thing.  Let's attack him on policy not nonsense.  Next, he is a Christian.  He is not a Muslim.  Twenty percent of the people say he is a Muslim, 80 percent of the people apparently do not believe he's a Muslim."
57,MR. GREGORY:  Thirty-one percent of Republicans say he's a Muslim.
58,"GEN. POWELL:  Well surprise, surprise.  But I'll bet you a dollar if the unemployment rate was not 9.6, but it was down to 4 percent, then you would find only 5 percent thinking he's Muslim.  So they're attacking the president on this line.  But he is not a Muslim, he is a Christian.  And I think we have to be careful when we, when we take things like Dinesh D'Souza's book, which is the source of all of this, and suggest that somehow the president of the United States is channeling his dead father through some Kenyan spirits.  This doesn't make any sense.  Mr. Gingrich does these things from time to time with a big, bold statement.  He did it with Sotomayor, ""She's a reverse racist."" He did it with Elena Kagan, ""She ought to pull out of--she ought to be taken off the, the nomination for Supreme Court justice."" And he does it occasionally to make news and to also stir up dust, kind of like the..."
59,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, what is this doing, General, to the party in your view?"
60,"GEN. POWELL:  I think it, I think it may appeal to certain elements of the party.  It may appeal to the fringe elements of the party.  But I don't think it appeals to all Republicans, and I don't think it appeals to the whole country.  This kind of chatter, ""He's a Kenyan channeler,"" and all this sort of stuff, makes a lot of news, and you will find that Governor Palin and people on the right side of the political spectrum, along with the tea party movement, really are getting a lot of attention and a lot of news and a lot of--they're making a lot of noise and they're making a lot of, a lot of chatter throughout our political system.  And that's fine, that's good.  But I don't think anybody should grab that and think that's the entire country."
61,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think that Republicans are poised to retake at least the House?  And would you like to see them do that with this--the current slate of candidates and some of the ideas?
62,"GEN. POWELL:  I, I don't know.  The, the pollsters would tell us that the Republicans are poised to take over the House.  That wouldn't break my heart, I wouldn't go into a funk.  Frankly, it might be good for the president to have the Republicans owning one of the two bodies of our Congress."
63,MR. GREGORY:  How so?
64,"GEN. POWELL:  Because then they have responsibility.  You can't just say no to everything.  You can't just sit around beating up the president.  But the president also has to, I think, shift the way in which he has been doing things.  I think the American people feel that too many programs have come down.  There are so many rocks in our knapsack now that we're having trouble carrying it.  I think the president has to, like a, like a, like a razor blade, just go right after the single issue that is uppermost in the minds of the American people and that's employment.  And he's done a lot with health care, with cap and trade, with education, and I understand the importance of all of that; but as far as the American people are concerned, the main attack is employment, and he's got to fix that."
65,"MR. GREGORY:  But, General, you, of course, endorsed him in 2008, and he and his advisers will tell you, ""Look, every day he's been in office he's been working on this."" And it strikes me you'll be giving a speech in Washington this week where you talk about how to move from commanding to connecting.  Is the ability to connect his problem?"
66,"GEN. POWELL:  I think he has lost some of the ability to connect that he had during the campaign.  And it is not just me picking on the president, it's reflected in the polling.  Some of the anxiety and anger that you see out there I think comes from a belief on the part of the American people, whether it's correct or incorrect--and the White House would say it's incorrect--that not enough attention--his singular focus should be on employment."
67,"Wall Street got fixed, they're getting their bonuses back.  We fixed the auto industry, it's starting to function.  But people are still seeing a 9.6 percent unemployment rate, they're losing their homes, their homes are underwater, mortgages can't be paid, short sales.  They are anxious, and they are expecting more out of the president.  So I think he has to do more with respect to reducing the deficit and also being careful about putting more and more programs, more and more rocks into that knapsack because the American people are looking for a singular focus on the economy and unemployment.  And as part of that, he needs to focus on the business community.  In my travels around the country, the business community is not that satisfied with the administration right now.  So I think the president is, is aware of all of this.  His advisers are aware of all of this.  And I hope we will see him moving more, more vigorously in this direction."
68,"MR. GREGORY:  What about moving more vigorously to the center?  Could he do more to court Republicans, to reach bipartisan compromise?"
69,"GEN. POWELL:  I think he might consider that after this upcoming election. Right now everybody's in the trenches.  Everybody's, as they say in ""Godfather II,"" ""They've all gone to the mattresses."" So we will see what happens after the election."
70,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to talk about foreign policy and ask you about Afghanistan.  Back in 2001, on this program, after the invasion, you told Tim Russert, ""I don't expect that you will see U.S.  combat troops there in Afghanistan for any length of time as part of that international security force."" Times change, 2010 we're surging up to 100,000 forces.  Is it the right thing to do?  Is this victory possible?"
71,"GEN. POWELL:  We all hoped in 2001 that we could put in place an Afghan government under President Karzai that would be able to control the country, make sure al-Qaeda didn't come back, and make sure the Taliban wasn't resurging.  It didn't work out.  And now I think that the strategy that has been adopted by President Obama to give the country a surge of U.S.  troops and NATO troops and to do everything we can to build up the Afghan army and the Afghan national police so that they can take over, it's a strategy the president said will start to move out of, or at least bring to some culminating point, next July when we start to reduce the level of troops that we have there."
72,"My problem right now is that I cannot get a good handle on how we're doing. Some of the generals are saying, ""We're making progress.  We are clearing an area."" But you really don't defeat the Taliban by clearing an area.  They move.  And so I cannot tell how well it's going.  My concern is that it also is resting on a very weak base with the Karzai government, corruption in the Karzai government, and the Karzai government, which has not really been effective in extending its control out beyond Kabul.  So I think we've got 10 months between now and next July, and I think the president will be facing a very, very difficult choice.  You hear a lot of chatter now coming out of various places within the Pentagon saying, ""Well, it will take time."" I don't know if the president will give them time beyond next July to start the drawdown.  Not pull out next July, but start the drawdown."
73,"MR. GREGORY:  In Iran, a path toward confrontation is possible, and I wonder what you think is worth--worse:  an Iran with a nuclear weapon or the fallout of an attack on Iran by either the U.S.  or Israel to prevent it having a nuclear weapon?"
74,"GEN. POWELL:  I don't think the, the stars are lining up for an attack on Iran either by Israel alone, or Israel in concert with the United States, or the United States alone.  I don't think that's going to happen.  I've heard nothing to suggest that we would be interested in doing that or think it would be useful even though the option is always on the table.  I think eventually we will have to deal with the reality that sanctions may not change the views of the Iranians on these issues; and, therefore, let's see if we can find a way to see if Iran can have a nuclear program that is fixed on power production, low-level enrichment of their material, so that it's not a track to become a weapon."
75,"Now, people will say that's naive.  Once you know how to do that you can then enrich up to weapons capability.  But I think if you take them at their word, ""trust, but verify,"" Reagan's old line, if you take them at their word, and they say they are not interested in a weapon, just power, then put in place a set of sanctions that would be devastating to them if they violate that agreement, and then put in place an IAEA inspection regime, the International Atomic Energy Administration, inspection regime that will keep them below that, and get Russia and China and everybody else to agree to it, then you might have to live with an Iran, and you might be able to live with an Iran that has a nuclear power capability, but rigid enforcement constraints have been put in so they can't move up to a weapons grade program and the production of a nuclear weapon.  Now, at the same time, what can they do with a nuclear weapon compared to what we could do in return?  I don't think it is--you know, they are interested in remaining in power.  The easiest way for them to lose power is to seriously threaten or use such a weapon."
76,"MR. GREGORY:  In our remaining couple of minutes, I want to ask you about an issue here at home that's very important to you, and that's education.  It's important to us at NBC News as well.  We've got a big meeting coming up, Education Nation, that both you and your wife, Alma, would be addressing in a special presentation on Tuesday, September 28th.  I wonder what you plan to talk about and how you feel this accountability movement, as part of education reform, has done at achieving results."
77,"GEN. POWELL:  I think we have seen quite a bit of improvement in the education reform effort in recent years.  What Alma and I will be focusing on when we appear on NBC, and I thank NBC for hosting this, is not just schools and teachers and the various aspects of the schools and education in schools, but how do you get kids ready for school.  A child that is not read to in a home, a child who can't tell time, who can't recite his alphabet, a child who comes to school without having had that early childhood rearing, without having been taught how to mind their adults, how to pay attention, how to focus; I think education doesn't begin in kindergarten and first grade, it begins when the child can look up at a mother lovingly and look up at a father lovingly.  So I think part of our system of reform has to include what we do in those early years of life and not just fixing our schools.  Too often we act--ask our schools to be truant officers, our teachers to be truant officers, because we're giving them children who have, you know, they're not ready to learn.  And if they're not ready to learn by the third grade, they know they're behind.  And by the sixth or seventh grade, they're thinking about dropping out.  And as soon as they enter high school, they drop out.  It is an unacceptable situation, our dropout rate."
78,"MR. GREGORY:  As you think about education policy, other important issues for the country, and before you go, you, of course, endorsed President Obama in 2008.  Are you prepared to endorse him for re-election?"
79,"GEN. POWELL:  Well, just as I did in 2008, when 2012 comes along, I will look at the needs of the country, the situation as I see it, and I will evaluate both candidates and see which one I think is best able to lead the country. In 2008, in my judgment, it was Mr. Obama.  We had a country that was in recession, heading into depression, we had banks failing, we had a stock market collapsing, we were in difficulty, and I thought that he was best able to deal with that with the advisers he was surrounding himself with, and we have stabilized our economy.  So I think that worked out."
80,"MR. GREGORY:  You described him as a transformational figure, to have the potential.  Has he lived up to that or do you find yourself disappointed?"
81,"GEN. POWELL:  I think he has--is a transformational figure.  Some people don't like what he's done in transformation, and it's caused him some difficulty.  But the fact of the matter is, he did put together a health care reform.  It's not perfect, and I think it'll have to be fixed over time, and a lot of people are not happy with that health care reform, but he did it.  We still have millions of our fellow citizens who have no insurance, especially children.  And so I think he has done transformational work with respect to education, and I think he should get credit for that.  But in other aspects, I think he has to focus on now governing, not worrying about the daily, the daily campaign problem or reacting to everything that comes across the cable news channel.  I think he needs to sort of get above all of that.  Yes, Mr. President, they will kick you like a dog, treat you like a dog, but hey, that's the nature of our system.  America's a great country, and this is the way we do our politics."
82,"MR. GREGORY:  We will leave it there.  General Powell, thank you, as always."
83,"GEN. POWELL:  Thank you, David."
84,"MR. GREGORY:  And coming next, former President Bill Clinton prepares to host leaders from around the world in the sixth annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting.  Plus, Decision 2010, what is ahead for Democrats this November?  Can President Obama turn things around?  And the state of the nation's economy. The 42nd president of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton, up next, live, right here on MEET THE PRESS."
85,(Announcements)
86,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up, President Bill Clinton joins me to discuss what Democrats can expect in November and what President Obama can do to turn things around, after this brief commercial break."
87,(Announcements)
88,"MR. GREGORY:  We are back, joined now live by the 42nd president of the United States, Bill Clinton."
89,"Mr. President, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS."
90,"FMR. PRES. BILL CLINTON:  Thank you, David."
91,"MR. GREGORY:  I'm looking forward to discussing the Clinton Global Initiative and your work in Haiti, but I just wanted to begin our political discussion with some reaction by you to hearing General Powell on what have been pretty significant developments this week politically inside the Republican Party after this turbulent primary season.  What do you make of it?"
92,"PRES. CLINTON:  Well, first of all, I think that a lot of the voters who are voting for the tea party candidates have really good impulses.  That is, they believe that for years and years and years, the people with wealth and power or government power have done well and ordinary people have not.  That's true. They believe those in the Republican Party believe that they've talked a good game about balancing the budget, but the debt was quadrupled in the 12 years before I became president and then we paid down the debt for four years, paid down $600 billion on the national debt, and then my budget was abandoned and they doubled the debt again.  So there's a good there.  They're worried that utter--we've come out of this recovery to some extent, about 70 percent of our GDP growth has been regained from what was lost, but ordinary people aren't feeling it yet and they want to see some help for ordinary people.  I get that.  The question is what are the specifics?  What really matters is what we're going to do.  And right now they've elected a lot of people who are articulate and attractive, but it's not clear what their specifics are.  The gentleman that beat Senator Murkowski@ in Alaska, as I understand it, said that he thought unemployment compensation was unconstitutional.  Well, putting 10 million more people in bread lines is not my idea of how to bring the economy back or balance the budget.  So we need to hear more from them about where they stand on the Republican Party's agenda.  Do they too want to repeal the financial regulations that were just enacted to provide more oversight and require more capital before risk can be undertaken so we don't get in this mess again?  We need to know where they stand."
93,"MR. GREGORY:  But what about Christine O'Donnell?  Does she ensure that a Democrat holds the--that Senate seat?  In other words, are candidates like a Christine O'Donnell actually helpful to the Democratic Party?"
94,"PRES. CLINTON:  Well, Karl Rove says they are.  I don't know.  I can't tell you.  She's a very attractive person, she speaks well on television.  And when you call her on something, she just says, ""Oh, everybody's playing negative politics."" Where does she stand?  Does she want to repeal the financial oversight bill?  Does she want to repeal the president's student loan reforms which allows young people, for the first time in history, to pay back all their loans as a percentage of their income so they never have to worry about dropping out of college?  We fell from first to 12th in the world in the percentage of our young adults with college graduates.  These are the important things.  The Republican leaders in Washington, they've got a big agenda.  They want to basically dismantle the federal authority except when it comes to defense and laying concrete, and cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans, and turn power over to the kind of folks that got us in trouble in the first place.  I want to know where they stand, and we don't yet."
95,"MR. GREGORY:  What about some of the extreme statements that you heard General Powell respond very sharply to by former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who you've done battle with and even worked constructively with, when he talked as he did to the National Review about the, the president's anti-colonial views?"
96,"PRES. CLINTON:  Well, keep in mind, when--after the 1994 election, one of the first things that Speaker Gingrich said was that Hillary and I were the enemy of normal Americans.  Every time something bad happened in America back then, he blamed it on the 1960s culture.  Even one woman who drowned her children and it turned out she'd been abused by her stepfather who was a local right-wing Republican leader, he said, ""Nonetheless, they were infected by all those Democratic bad things."" So that's just what he does when he's running. He's, he's out there playing politics, and it's his shtick.  He knows better. He's a smart man."
97,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, we'll return to politics in a few minutes, but I want to talk about your work around the world and the Clinton Global Initiative, your sixth annual meeting that begins this week in New York.  What is the focus? What do you hope to achieve this year?"
98,"PRES. CLINTON:  Well, this year we're, we're focusing again on trying to empower women and girls in the United States and around the world because, particularly around the world, 60 percent of the kids that don't go to school are girls.  And we know that if women can get an education, if they have an opportunity to enter the workforce, that a lot of these problems in very poor countries will be lessened.  We're focused on bringing the benefits of private sector job growth to the challenges we face, including the energy challenges we face, not just around the world, but here in America.  We've got a lot of commitments that I think you'll find interesting which will actually create jobs in this economy in the United States.  I, I try to get people to focus, to go beyond their rhetoric and their concerns to actually getting real things done.  We're, we're going to have two, two or more electric cars on display that will be manufactured in America, that will be creating jobs here.  We're going to talk a lot about what can be done with new technology to generate economic opportunity around the world in poor countries and here in America. We're going to talk a lot about health care and how to build up systems of health care so the U.S.  and other wealthy countries aren't just sending aid to poor countries forever, but they can support themselves in health and education and their growing economy."
99,"And, you know, half of the people who come to our meeting, from 90 countries, are business people, about a third come from the nongovernmental sector, philanthropists and, and organizations that do work on the ground.  We have 40 heads of state coming and 24 former heads of state, and then people from academia and other places.  And we get everybody to make a commitment.  So I think you'll see a lot of very specific emphasis on things that create economic opportunity, that advance educational opportunity, that help women and girls who are left out and left behind in many poor places in the world."
100,"MR. GREGORY:  As you think about the world, as president you talked about globalization, the interconnectedness of our global economy.  And you look at the poverty that this country is going through, the poverty report that came out this week, more and more families going into homeless shelters, seven out of 10 people who are out of work.  How does CGI, in effect, address both that domestic need and put it together with the global needs?"
101,"PRES. CLINTON:  Well, this year we're going to try to spend more time on the domestic needs by getting and generating support for people who are working to reach those folks with both jobs and with training.  Let me just give you an example that's really chilling to me.  And this is what I wish we'd have more talk about in the elections this year in America.  Where are the jobs going to come from?  Where's the money to finance them going to come from?  And can people do them?  For the first time in my lifetime, David, we are coming out of recession with posted job openings.  That is, tomorrow, Monday, you could get that job.  These jobs have been offered.  They're going up twice as fast as job hires in this horrible economy.  Why?  Because of two things.  First, over 10 million of our fellow citizens are living in homes that are worth less than their mortgages, so they can't move or their credit's ruined for life. We still need more efforts to fix that.  And second, way the biggest problem, is there's a skills mismatch.  The jobs that are being opened don't have qualified people applying for them.  We need a system to immediately train them to move into that job.  And I hope we'll have some commitments coming out on that.  There are five million people who could go to work tomorrow if they were trained to do the jobs that are open, and the unemployment rate in America would immediately drop from 9.6 to about 7 percent or 6.9.  That would have a huge impact on America's psyche.  That would happen if no bank makes another loan, if none of this other stuff goes on.  We need to go to work on these things and get some action there."
102,"MR. GREGORY:  Mr. President, let me ask you about your work in Haiti, which has been extensive.  When I spoke to you on this program back in January, you told me the mission in Haiti wouldn't just be to rebuild, but to build something stronger.  And yet, here are some disturbing facts about the reality in Haiti.  Reports estimate only 2 percent of the quake debris has been cleared, 1.5 million Haitians are still in tents, foreign donors have pledged $11 billion over the next decade, but only 18 percent or about $5 billion pledged over the next two years has been dispersed.  Why is the progress this slow?"
103,"PRES. CLINTON:  Well, first of all, on the housing, it's always the slowest thing.  You can go to--after we had Hurricane Andrew, right before I became president, people were still living in temporary housing in Florida over a year after the quake happened--after the hurricane happened.  So keep in mind, you had a third of this country totally devastated.  It was the urban third. It represented a loss of 70 percent of their GDP.  So we can't move them out any quicker than that."
104,"Secondly, all the rubble that is in the cities, it's normally in places where the roads are broken."
105,"And thirdly, we haven't been given much money.  A lot of people promised all this money.  So what I've done with this commission, we have a commission now that's half Haitian and half the donors, and they have approved an enormous amount of new projects.  We have to have the donors give the money.  If the donors don't give the money, we can't do the work."
106,"We will be moving this rubble out.  And on October the 6th we're going to have a big housing expo down there to talk about building single units and multifamily, multistory units.  And one of the things that I think will happen is a lot of these builders will come down there and help us get rid of the rubble by crushing it on site and either using it there or carting it away in a much more easy fashion.  We're going to have to destroy a lot of that rubble where it is.  We can't just lift it up and move it away the way people would think.  But if we do, we can speed this up and get some things going.  We did have the first new hotel that's been announced there.  I have two more hotels ready to be announced, thousands of people who'll go to work.  If we build a road, we've got the road approval now, and expand an airport in the northern part of the country.  I think you will see in the next six months a dramatic acceleration if the election doesn't mess it up.  They're having an election in the middle of all this, which is highly unusual for a country in the throes of rebuilding."
107,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
108,"PRES. CLINTON:  But we'll get it all done, I think."
109,"MR. GREGORY:  All--well, let's talk about our election.  A year ago, on this program, we met up in New York and I asked you about the prospect of another 1994.  This is what you said then:"
110,"(Videotape, September 27, 2009)"
111,"MR. GREGORY:  Do you worry about a repeat of '94, politically?"
112,PRES. CLINTON:  It--there's no way they can make it that bad.
113,(End videotape)
114,MR. GREGORY:  Your view one year later?
115,PRES. CLINTON:  Do I still think that?
116,MR. GREGORY:  Yes.
117,"PRES. CLINTON:  Well, they can't make it that bad, but we can.  That is, there is all this anger on the right and they're very motivated to vote, but all the surveys show the registered voters are about evenly divided.  The problem is not just anger on the right, the problem is that a lot of people who voted for the Democrats in 2006 and voted for President Obama in 2008, many of them first-time voters, are kind of apathetic.  They say, ""Oh, well, this whole thing hasn't been fixed in a year, and why should I go vote?"" And they don't understand the differences.  That's why I think it's really important for the debate to go beyond where it is now.  Where it is now is, the Republicans said, ""We left them in a $3 trillion hole, they had 21 months to fix it, they didn't fix it, throw them out.  And besides that, they're trying to have the government take over the country."" Which is not so.  The Democrats say, ""Well, at least we stopped digging that hole and we're trying to build our way out.  Give us a couple more years.  If it's not better then, you can throw us out.  But, after all, you left the Republicans in for a long time.  At least give us four years to try to fix this mess."""
118,"What I'd like to see them talk about now is two things:  One, and most important, what are we going to do in the next two years, and who's more likely to do it?  Where are the jobs going to come from?  Small business, manufacturing and clean energy.  Where's the money to finance them?  The banks and the corporations in America today have lots of money that they can invest right now.  Banks have $1.8 trillion in cash reserves uncommitted to loans, more than enough to get us out.  And the third thing is the job training thing I mentioned earlier."
119,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
120,"PRES. CLINTON:  How are we going to train people for the jobs that are there? Then, then I think the, the Democrats ought to talk about the Republican agenda.  They want to repeal financial reform.  They want to repeal the best student loan reform in history.  They want to repeal, not fix, health care. Health care needs fixing, but if you repeal it, you'll go back to what we had. This year, 2009, in the depths of that recession, health insurance profits went up 26 percent, profits.  As they were saying, ""Oh, well, we had to raise these health premiums in a bad economy because our costs went up."""
121,"MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But, Mr. President..."
122,"PRES. CLINTON:  So that's the issue.  If the Democrats can focus on that and shake the voters out of their apathy, then we'll do fine."
123,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  But let me ask you about a couple of issues.
124,"PRES. CLINTON:  If they don't, we won't."
125,"MR. GREGORY:  Let me ask you about health care.  Back in August of 2009, you spoke in front of that Netroots convention, and this is what you said about healthcare reform.  Let's watch:"
126,"(Videotape, August 13, 2009)"
127,"PRES. CLINTON:  I'm telling you, I don't care how low they drive support for this with misinformation, the minute the president signs the healthcare reform bill, approval will go up because Americans are inherently optimistic.  The minute."
128,(End videotape)
129,"MR. GREGORY:  The White House said the same thing, Mr. President, but it hasn't happened yet."
130,"PRES. CLINTON:  Well, I was wrong about that for two reasons.  First of all, the benefits of the bill are spread out over three or four years.  It takes a long time to implement it.  And secondly, there was--there's been an enormous and highly effective attack on it.  But I think it's important.  Let's--forget about the politics.  Let's talk about the facts here.  The real reason that the interest groups want to repeal, not fix health care, is that they like the way it's going now.  They're dumping people every year and making the government pick them up.  We are spending 17.2 percent of our income on health care.  None of our wealthy competitors spend more than 10 1/2.  Yet our infant mortality rate is higher than theirs, our overall mortal--age expectancy is lower than theirs.  We don't have a better health system than they do.  What's happened?  That's a trillion dollars we spot our competitors every year for a health system that doesn't work as well.  The people that are getting a trillion dollars have a lot of money to spread all this information--misinformation."
131,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
132,"PRES. CLINTON:  And, you know, last night, I was with a 70-year-old neighbor of mine who is a dedicated Roman Catholic layman and a doctor, and he said, you know, ""I just don't know what I'll do if they repeal this health care. We--we've never taken care of people."" So there, there is--you can scare people about this, but you asked me about the politics.  No one ever talks about the facts.  Why do they want to repeal health care?  Because there is a requirement that 85 percent of all the premiums finally go to health care. And they'd like to get rid of that."
133,"MR. GREGORY:  They're, they're..."
134,"PRES. CLINTON:  I don't blame them but it would be a terrible mistake.  We need to fix health care, put more cost restraints in there, not repeal it."
135,MR. GREGORY:  Do you think President Obama is as effective as he could be? Your friend James Carville said that he enjoys policy a lot more than politics.  Does that have an impact on the enthusiasm or lack thereof of Democrats?
136,"PRES. CLINTON:  Well, you know, I told the president, last time I talked to him, I said, ""I don't think they're saying very many things about you now they didn't say about me in '94."" And they're trying to create this atmosphere of attention deficit disorder and not look at what's happened.  The president passed a good education reform, he passed a good higher education reform, he--we've stopped the digging.  There, there was an independent study last week that showed that saving the financial system, keeping the interest rates near zero by the Feds, and the stimulus had left us in better shape.  If those three things had not been done, eight and a half million more people would be unemployed.  People just don't feel better, and they're vulnerable, and the Democrats need to say, ""This is what we did, this is what happened, this is what we're going to do."""
137,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
138,"PRES. CLINTON:  I think that their only chance here is to shake their own voters out of their apathy and respond to the legitimate voter anger by saying, ""What's going to happen in the next two years?  What do we need to do, and who's more likely to do it."" If that is the question, they can win that fight and they'll do fine.  If the election's about ""Vote your mad,"" they won't do very well.  So I'm--I just try to talk about what are we going to do, what are we going to do.  And I think the president is beginning to do that."
139,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
140,"PRES. CLINTON:  If we need to grow jobs in small business, manufacturing, and green energy, he and the Democrats are the only people with a real program for that.  And right now, the other side is opposing his small business initiative in the Congress.  So I'd like to see his focus on what are we going to do.  A lot of this politics doesn't amount to anything.  We need to put America back to work, and we need specifics."
141,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Mr. President, about 30 seconds left.  Two quick personal things.  There are some who have wondered if you're looking a little too thin and they worry about your health.  Are you OK?"
142,"PRES. CLINTON:  As far as I know, I'm fine.  I've lost about--yesterday, I was down 24 pounds from my maximum.  But I went on a new diet and I'm exercising and I feel great.  And I'm trying not to have another heart incident.  You know, I had that stent put in after my open heart surgery, so I'm trying to pursue a diet that will..."
143,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
144,PRES. CLINTON:  ...make sure that I don't have another incident.
145,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Mr. President, as always, thank you very much.  Good luck with CGI this week."
146,"PRES. CLINTON:  Thanks, David."
147,"MR. GREGORY:  And up next, in our MEET THE PRESS Minute, a look back at longtime NBC newsman and occasional MEET THE PRESS moderator, Edwin Newman. We'll look back at Newman's first ever appearance on this program, July 10th, 1960, when he questioned presidential candidate John F.  Kennedy on a now all-too-familiar topic of an economic recession, after this brief station break."
148,(Announcements)
149,"MR. GREGORY:  And we are back with our MEET THE PRESS MINUTE.  We learned this week of the death of long-time NBC Newsman Edwin Newman.  Newman spent 30 years with this network, appearing on all programs across the news division. He was the bureau chief in London, Rome and Paris, and later moved to New York where he became a regular member of the ""Today"" show team.  Newman also served as moderator of this program more than 40 times, and as a frequent panelist as well.  In his first ever appearance on the program, July 10th, 1960 he interviewed Democratic presidential candidate John F.  Kennedy from the site of the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles."
150,"(Videotape, July 10, 1960)"
151,MR. EDWIN NEWMAN:  You've suggested spending another $2.5 billion or $3 billion on defense.  You've also said you don't think the present administration will do that.
152,MR. JOHN F.  KENNEDY:  That's correct.
153,"MR. NEWMAN:  Now, if you became president and you did it, it would take some time for that money to be spent and to make itself felt in the economy.  Do you conclude that a recession is inevitable?"
154,"MR. KENNEDY:  No, I hope it is not.  I just say that I think this is a very--a period of, I would say, of--which ought to be an alarm bell to us all. I think..."
155,MR. NEWMAN:  You...
156,"MR. KENNEDY:  ...it bears resemblance to the summer of 1957, but I think maybe more serious.  There was a recession in '49, a recession in '54 and a recession in '58.  Now we're talking about a slowdown two years after the recession of '58.  I don't think that this administration can successfully run on a program of domestic prosperity if the real facts are pointed out."
157,(End videotape)
158,"MR. GREGORY:  Three years later on November 22nd, 1963, Edwin Newman would make the first announcement on NBC radio of President Kennedy's death.  Newman died of pneumonia in Oxford, England, where he had lived since 2007.  He was 91.  And we'll be right back."
159,(Announcements)
160,"MR. GREGORY:  And before we go, a programming note.  Tune into CNBC tomorrow at noon for ""Investing in America,"" a CNBC town hall event with President Obama.  The president will take questions about the economy and the direction of the country from a live studio audience."
161,And be sure to join us right here next week when MEET THE PRESS kicks off NBC's education week live from New York.
162,"That is all for today.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

        MR. DAVID GREGORY:  This Sunday, from New York, a special edition of MEET THE PRESS.  This morning we kick off a weeklong commitment at NBC News to Education Nation.  We will try to cut to the core of the crisis in public education.  This weekend's opening of the emotional documentary ""Waiting for `Superman'"" is a powerful reminder that too many schools are failing our children, and America's competitiveness is suffering as a result.  Are resources the answer?  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced he will donate $100 million to Newark, New Jersey, schools.  How do we ensure the best teachers are in the classroom?  What reforms are working?  And what can each one of us do to help?  Our discussion with Secretary of Education Arne Duncan; leading reformer and chancellor of Washington, D.C., schools Michelle Rhee; Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers; and Robert Bobb, the emergency financial manager of the Detroit Public Schools.

GREGORY:  But first to politics and the fight for Congress.  Will the House, in this divided campaign season, fall to the GOP?  If so, what will Republicans do in power?  This week Republican leaders in the house unveiled their Pledge to America, a campaign manifesto that is the 2010 of the GOP's Contract with America from 1994.  The highlights:  extend the Bush tax cuts, cut spending, and repeal healthcare reform."

7,REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH):  Our Pledge to America is that the Republicans stand ready to get it done and beginning today.
8,(End videotape)
9,"MR. GREGORY:  But the question is are these new ideas or more of the same? Here to debate that question, among others, one of the architects of the Republican pledge, the chairman of the House Republican Congress, Representative--Conference, rather, Representative Mike Pence of Indiana. He's here in New York.  And the man responsible for electing Democrats to the House this fall, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland."
10,Welcome both of you to MEET THE PRESS.
11,REP. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD):  Thank you.
12,"MR. GREGORY:  We're here in New York.  Congressman Pence, good to have you here with me on, on our breezy set here this morning.  We'll be able to get through that."
13,I want to get to the pledge and its contents and this whole debate about whether these are new ideas or not...
14,REP. MIKE PENCE (R-IN):  Right.
15,MR. GREGORY:  ...in just a moment.
16,"But, Congressman Van Hollen and Congressman Pence, I want to start on the narrow issue of tax cuts and the big tax cut debate that is part of this midterm campaign."
17,"We know, Congressman Van Hollen, that the Senate has kicked off the decision--kicked it back, I should say, till after the elections to take on whether or not the Bush tax cuts should be extended.  What will the House do on this important question?"
18,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Well, David, the House will vote before these tax cuts expire at the end of the year.  Whether we vote before the election or not is something we'll take a look at.  But I want to be very clear as to what the stakes are here because what the Republicans have said is that they're going to hold tax relief for 98 percent of the American people hostage until they can get permanent tax breaks for the top 2 percent, even though that would blow a $700 billion hole in the deficit, something that would be added to the credit cards of our children and grandchildren, and slow down economic growth and jobs going forward."
19,"MR. GREGORY:  But what about the timing?  Because you say it's probably not till after the election.  I've talked to economists, read their words this week, who say the longer you wait the more uncertainty.  Why not put it to a vote before the midterms?"
20,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Well, we are absolutely going to get this done before the end of the year.  We may well take it up before the midterms.  But, as you've heard from Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, they are insisting on holding the tax cuts for most of the American people hostage until they get these breaks for the very top.  And we don't think that we should be adding $700 billion to our deficit.  That's fiscally reckless at a time that we need to be imposing some fiscal discipline.  We should not be adding red ink that's going to have to be picked up by others and, and put us more in hock to China and other countries."
21,"MR. GREGORY:  OK.  All right, Congressman Pence, you can..."
22,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  That just does not make sense.
23,"MR. GREGORY:  ...you can take on the substance of that.  But first, answer this question about the time, maybe, because this is where the news is, should the House take this up before the midterm vote?"
24,"REP. PENCE:  David, there is no question that there should be no higher priority for the Congress of the United States today than making sure that no American sees a tax increase in January of 2011, not one.  I, I, I have to tell you, this, for all the world, seems like a moment where Congress is putting politics ahead of prosperity.  You know, it--what, what they're proposing here, even a--even if they found some way to just extend middle class tax relief, would be an enormous tax increase in January on job creators in this country.  You know, higher taxes won't get people hired.  Raising taxes on job creators won't create jobs, and the American people know that."
25,"But let me say one last thing.  I, I..."
26,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  David...
27,REP. PENCE:  ...I think it would be unconscionable for this Congress to adjourn without giving the bipartisan majority in the Congress that wants to extend all current tax relief an up or down vote.
28,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  But let me ask you this because this is a key question.
29,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  David--wait, David."
30,"MR. GREGORY:  Yeah, hold on, Congressman, I'll get right back to you.  But I want to ask this key question.  In this Pledge to America that..."
31,REP. PENCE:  Right.
32,"MR. GREGORY:  ...that we'll talk about in, in greater detail in just a moment, is this commitment to bringing down the deficit."
33,REP. PENCE:  Right.
34,"MR. GREGORY:  As well as extending the tax cuts.  How do you answer the charge from Democrats, from the president as well, that you don't have a way to pay for extending the tax cuts, and yet you're committed to deficit reduction?"
35,"REP. PENCE:  Well, look, in the Pledge to America, which I look forward to chatting about, we say, look, we've got to do something to get this economy moving again.  We give real and meaningful proposals to begin the process of reining in runaway federal spending by both political parties..."
36,"MR. GREGORY:  But, but how do you pay for the tax cuts is the question."
37,REP. PENCE:  ...and reforming the government.
38,"Look, job one needs to be to create jobs.  The American people know the last thing you want to do in the worst economy in 25 years is raise taxes on small business owners and family farmers.  We have to vote before Congress adjourns for the political season, the fall elections, on an up or down vote.  More than 30 Democrats support extending all the current tax relief.  And, and we're calling on Speaker Pelosi and leaders like Chris, give us an up or down vote, let the Congress work its will and give the American people certainty..."
39,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Dave...
40,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman Van Hollen, go ahead."
41,REP. PENCE:  ...that there will be no tax increase.
42,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  David, this notion that Mike's talking about, that you need to have these tax breaks for the very top to create jobs and economic expansion, Mike, those tax rights are in effect right now.  They're in effect right now.  I don't see all this job creation as a result of those tax cuts. They've been in effect for nine years.  At the end of those nine years, we've seen losses of millions of jobs.  So this, this story that somehow those breaks for the very folks at the top create these jobs is, is just nonsense."
43,And I want to make one other point because they have...
44,"REP. PENCE:  Well, but the--there's no question..."
45,MR. GREGORY:  Hold on.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.
46,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  ...they have--they--one other point.  They have tried to mask this as an issue with small businesses.  Well, it turns out that only 2 percent of small businesses are affected.  And when you look at the definition of small businesses, you find that they're big hedge funds, big Washington lobbying firms, KKR, Pricewaterhouse.  Because, under the definition of tax code, anything that's an S corporation qualifies.  So I want Mike to tell us whether he really believes that KKR, whether Pricewaterhouse, whether those are the kind of small businesses that need help?  Because that's the folks that they're trying to help out.  We don't..."
47,MR. GREGORY:  I want to ask a different question about taxes.
48,"REP. PENCE:  Well, well, look..."
49,"MR. GREGORY:  Wait a minute, I want to..."
50,"REP. PENCE:  Can I respond to that, though?"
51,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, in just..."
52,REP. PENCE:  I think he makes a very good point.
53,"MR. GREGORY:  OK, go ahead."
54,"REP. PENCE:  If the current tax relief was enough to get this economy moving again, the economy would be moving and it's not.  What, what Chris and the Democrats in Congress and the administration continue to insist on is a tax increase in January of 2011.  But I want to stipulate to the point.  That's why Republicans, in the Pledge to America, called for a 20 percent business deduction on all business income immediately, to be voted on in this Congress. We think there needs to be more pro-growth tax relief to get the economy moving again.  But, for heaven sakes, let's not raise taxes on job creators."
55,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, but let me ask you a bigger question about tax cuts or tax hikes.  You say in the Pledge to America that you want to bring spending down to 2008 levels, which you well know is not enough to really seriously tackle the deficit, even if you bring it back to 2008.  So the question for you, and I'll ask Congressman Van Hollen, how can you rule out tax hikes as we move forward if you want to get serious about tackling the deficit?"
56,"REP. PENCE:  Well, look, I, I--number one, I think you rule out tax increases because our problem isn't that the American people are taxed too little, our problem is that Washington spends too much.  In the Pledge to America we call for cutting discretionary spending to pre-stimulus, pre-bailout levels, cutting the amount of funding allocated to Congress, freezing all pay on nonsecurity federal employees, ending federal control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, ending TARP.  That'd save a trillion dollars over 10 years alone. And, you know, reducing discretionary spending back to those 2008 levels, that would be--I mean, that would save $100 billion this year."
57,"MR. GREGORY:  That's fine, but that doesn't..."
58,"REP. PENCE:  We, we can get there through fiscal discipline and reform."
59,MR. GREGORY:  ...that really doesn't tackle the deficit completely.
60,"Congressman Van Hollen, the question for you and for Democrats, can you rule out tax hikes as we move forward to be serious about cutting the deficit?"
61,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  I'm sorry, David, what was the question?  I couldn't hear you."
62,"MR. GREGORY:  Can you--do you really rule out tax increases not just for the wealthiest Americans, but even for the middle class, if we're going to get serious about dealing with the deficit?"
63,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Yeah.  Yeah, we think it would be a big mistake to raise taxes on 98 percent of the American people.  And I want to go back to this point that Mike raised about small businesses.  The president and the Democrats have proposed tax cuts for small businesses to generate new activity.  In fact, the president's just said let's provide 100 percent write-off for investments made between now and 2011.  And what was interesting was they had this big ceremony for the pledge at a small business site, within hours they came back to the Hill and voted against the Small Business Lending Bill which, in addition to increasing access to credit for small businesses, contains significant tax cuts.  And Senator Voinovich, who's a retiring Republican senator said it's time for the Republicans to stop playing politics when the American people are hurting.  And I hope they will begin to do that because..."
64,MR. GREGORY:  Let...
65,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  ...they violated their pledge within hours about cutting taxes to small businesses.
66,"MR. GREGORY:  You know, as you go back to 1994, Congressman Pence, there was the Contract with America, and one of the big issues, if you go back even to interviews I've done with Republican leaders till after the election of President Obama, was that this wanted to be the party of new ideas."
67,REP. PENCE:  Right.
68,"MR. GREGORY:  And, in fact, this, this pledge has been criticized for being anything but new.  Where satire is most effective, Jon Stewart on ""The Daily Show"" this week raised this issue by comparing some of what was said in 1998 by Speaker--rather, who wants to be speaker, Boehner, John Boehner, to what he said in unveiling the pledge.  And this is what it looked like."
69,"(Videotape, ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,"" Thursday)"
70,REP. JOHN BOEHNER:  (From September 23) A smaller...
71,"(From March 3, 1998) A smaller..."
72,(From September 23) ...less costly...
73,"(From March 3, 1998) ...less costly..."
74,(From September 23) ...and more accountable...
75,"(From March 3, 1998) ...and more accountable..."
76,"(From September 23, 2010 and March 3, 1998; in unison) ...government in our nation's capital."
77,MR. JON STEWART:  Wow.  That's--I don't even know what to say.  This thing's not even a sequel.  It's like a shot-by-shot remake of your--I thought the pledge was you were humbled and going to come back with fresh new ideas. Wasn't that the pledge?
78,(End videotape)
79,MR. GREGORY:  So what's new here?
80,"REP. PENCE:  Well, ending bailouts and cutting spending in Washington, D.C., is a new idea, David.  And the truth is, look, Republicans didn't just lose our majority in 2006, we lost our way.  We walked away from the principles of fiscal discipline and reform that minted our governing majority back in 1980 and again in 1994, and the American people walked away from us.  What, what we have in this proposal is not, not necessarily new.  The idea of fiscal responsibility, pro-growth policies, openness and transparency in government are solid, American ideas.  What Republicans are committing to in this Pledge to America is taking important first steps in this Congress to steer our national government back to those basic practices and principles."
81,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman Van Hollen, do you agree?  Is this a return to core principles or is this a rehash?"
82,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Look, this is a rehash.  It's a recycling of the Bush economic agenda.  They put a new front page on it, but otherwise this is a Xerox copy.  Their whole answer to everything seems to be give the folks at the very top a tax break, and then they want to undo the regulations and reforms on Wall Street.  I mean, the problems on Wall Street led to catastrophe around the country, millions of people lost their jobs, and they're trying to do what lobbyists tried very hard to do, but didn't succeed, which is to say, ""Let's put those guys back in charge."" And I--it is a return to the Bush economic agenda.  There's no doubt about it."
83,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let me follow up..."
84,"REP. PENCE:  David, David..."
85,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  I would point out...
86,MR. GREGORY:  Let me follow up on this point.
87,REP. PENCE:  (Unintelligible)
88,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  ...this is not...
89,"MR. GREGORY:  Congressman Pence, hold on, let me follow up on this point..."
90,REP. PENCE:  Yeah.
91,"MR. GREGORY:  ...which is where you think this is a credible economic argument.  You voted against TARP.  You opposed the stimulus, as did other Republican leaders.  And yet people, economists who have looked at this from both sides of the aisle, Robert Samuelson writing in Newsweek who is a more conservative columnist on economic matters, says that the aggressive actions taken, going back to TARP and then followed through by this administration, most definitely had an impact on GDP, on the fact that we don't see unemployment approaching 16 percent.  Is it credible for Republicans to ask for the vote this November when, effectively, you would've let the financial system teeter off the edge of a cliff?"
92,"REP. PENCE:  Well, it--look, Republicans weren't prepared to let the financial system teeter off a cliff."
93,MR. GREGORY:  You voted against TARP.
94,REP. PENCE:  We just thought taking $700 billion...
95,"MR. GREGORY:  What would've happened if, if you had not passed TARP?"
96,"REP. PENCE:  Well, David, we just thought taking $700 billion from Main Street and transferring it to Wall Street was a profoundly bad idea."
97,"MR. GREGORY:  That's good rhetoric, but what would've happened to the financial system?"
98,REP. PENCE:  Now we...
99,MR. GREGORY:  Who in the financial system thinks it didn't stabilize the system?
100,"REP. PENCE:  Yeah, look.  Republicans, Republicans had a proposal, it was a backstop, not a handout.  It--we could've, we could've worked out this as a lot of the post-mortem analysis suggested we could.  Look, this is not a choice between the failed economic policies of the present and the failed economic policies of the past.  I know that the Democrats want to frame it that way.  What Republicans are saying is we have to get back, we have to end the era of borrowing and spending and bailouts and government takeovers.  We have to repeal Obama care lock, stock, and barrel, oppose their cap and trade schemes, and then we've got to get back to the practice of fiscal responsibility and the kind of policies that'll get this economy growing again."
101,"MR. GREGORY:  Name me one painful choice on spending the Republicans are prepared to make, that there could be some real blowback for politically, that they'll stand by if they want to reduce the deficit and rein in spending?"
102,"REP. PENCE:  Well, look, I, look, I, you know..."
103,MR. GREGORY:  I read through this.  I want to know where is the painful choice that you're prepared to make on spending?
104,"REP. PENCE:  Look, I, I never thought you'd ask.  Look, cutting discretionary spending."
105,MR. GREGORY:  On what?
106,"REP. PENCE:  Down to pre-stimulus, pre-bailout..."
107,MR. GREGORY:  Name the painful choice on a program that you're going to cut.
108,"REP. PENCE:  Look, we could reduce, we could reduce government employment back down to 2008 levels.  That's $35 billion over 10.  We could eliminate government programs like the Save America's Treasures programs."
109,MR. GREGORY:  (Unintelligible).
110,REP. PENCE:  That's $300 million.
111,MR. GREGORY:  Talk--what about entitlement spending?  Are you going to raise the retirement age...
112,REP. PENCE:  Look...
113,MR. GREGORY:  ...as John Boehner suggests might be a good idea on Social Security?
114,"REP. PENCE:  Look.  Well, you know, in--the last time I was on this program, I told you we'd keep our promises to seniors and near seniors, but for Americans under the age of 40, we absolutely have to begin to reform Medicare and Social Security in ways that'll ensure its long-term fiscal solvency.  But let me assure you, the Pledge to America is not the end-all, be-all, it's meant to be a good start."
115,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Congressman Van Hollen, what about President Clinton who said this week on MSNBC, ""Perhaps the Democrats need a pledge of their own.  They need a card with three or five of the top points that they're going to campaign on."" What would those be for Democrats in the fall and do you take his advice?"
116,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Well, the Democrats have set out what their plans are. We're going to continue as the president has said to focus on providing relief to small business going, going forward.  We have a bill coming to the floor of the House this week that I hope Mike Pence and his colleagues will join us on to try to make sure that we are not put at a competitive disadvantage by the Chinese currency manipulation.  We're going to continue to focus on clean energy jobs and incentives for clean energy, and we're going to continue to focus on the economy."
117,"And I have to say, when you look at the Republican so-called pledge, you find a lot of phony numbers.  Let me give you an example.  They say they're going to, they're going to save $16 billion by getting rid of TARP.  Mike, we voted to get rid of TARP already.  It was part of the Wall Street Reform Bill that Republicans opposed.  That bill terminated TARP.  And yet, in this pledge, they're pretending that they're going to find savings from shutting down something that we've already shut down.  That's the kind of thing I think people are tired of.  Earmarks.  They've made all this talk about how they were going to end earmarks.  We reformed the earmark process.  We said no more earmarks that distort the private market by going to for-profit, private entities.  There's not a word in there about that.  I assume that they're going to go back to their old ways..."
118,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
119,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  ...when they quadrupled earmarks.
120,MR. GREGORY:  We...
121,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  It's hard to take seriously, given their record here, and it is the same old, same old."
122,MR. GREGORY:  I've got...
123,"REP. PENCE:  Look, different from the Democrats, we Republicans refuse to request any earmarks this year whatsoever.  We've imposed a self-imposed moratorium on earmarks, and we're going to end earmarking as we know it..."
124,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
125,REP. PENCE:  ...if we have a chance to lead the Congress again.
126,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Mike...
127,"MR. GREGORY:  I'm going to leave that, I'm going to leave that part of it done.  We have about 10 seconds left."
128,"Congressman Van Hollen, you're in charge of getting Democrats elected in the House.  How bad will November be at this point in time in your judgment?"
129,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Democrats are going to do very well.  We're going to keep the majority because the choice we've talked about here, they said they were listening to the American people.  One of the biggest recommendations was to end these perverse tax breaks that encourage offshoring, outsourcing of American jobs.  We've closed down some of those loopholes.  We're going to continue to do it.  There's not a word about the outsourcing problem in America in that pledge, not one word in 46 pages."
130,MR. GREGORY:  All right.
131,REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Those are the kind of choices people are focusing on in this election.
132,"MR. GREGORY:  We're going to leave it there.  The debate will continue as we move forward in this campaign.  Congressman Pence, Congressman Van Hollen, thank you both very much."
133,"REP. VAN HOLLEN:  Thank you, David."
134,"MR. GREGORY:  And up next, here in New York, we kick off NBC's weeklong commitment to Education Nation.  How can we best reform our failing school system and make America competitive again?  Our special discussion with Secretary of Education Arne Duncan; D.C. Schools chancellor, Michelle Rhee; American Federation of Teachers president, Randi Weingarten; and Emergency Financial Manager of the Detroit Public Schools, Robert Bobb, only here on MEET THE PRESS."
135,                               (Announcements)
136,"MR. GREGORY:  Coming up, we kick off NBC's Education Nation with an in-depth discussion about our nation's public schools.  What are the solutions?  How do we get the best teachers in our classrooms?  Right after this brief commercial break."
137,                               (Announcements)
138,"MR. GREGORY:  And we are back live from 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York to kick off NBC's Education Nation.  It is our weeklong look into the state of our country's education system.  Joining me now, four key voices in the struggle to improve public K through 12 education, the emergency financial manager of the Detroit public schools, Robert Bobb; the chancellor of Washington, D.C., schools, Michelle Rhee; the U.S. secretary of Education, Arne Duncan; and the president of the American Federation of Teachers, Randi Weingarten."
139,"Welcome to all of you for such an important topic, an important commitment, I think, by NBC News, as well, to really exploring it this week.  And we begin now."
140,"What's getting all the buzz right now in the reform movement is this film, ""Waiting for `Superman,'"" which has debuted this weekend, and I wanted to play just a portion of it that talks about the huge challenge we face, one of the disturbing facts in our education system, as they show in the movie."
141,"(Videotape, ""Waiting for `Superman'"")"
142,"Narrator:  Since the 1970s, U.S. schools have failed to keep pace with the rest of the world.  Among 30 developed countries, we ranked 25th in math and 21st in science.  The top 5 percent of our students, our very best, ranked 23rd out of 29 developed countries.  In almost every category, we've fallen behind."
143,(End videotape)
144,"MR. GREGORY:  And look at a snapshot from our new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll on the question of education in terms of the public view of how education is.  Seventy-seven percent in our poll give our public schools a C grade or lower.  And in terms of the state of public schools, 58 percent in our poll, if we look at the next screen, 58 percent believe that major changes or complete overhaul is needed."
145,"And, indeed, Secretary Duncan, an overhaul is in the works.  Where are we right now in terms of reform?"
146,"SEC'Y ARNE DUNCAN:  We've made tremendous progress.  But let me be clear, David, as a country, we have a long, long way to go.  We have to educate our way to a better economy.  Education is an economic strategy.  When you see us being 20th in, you know, math and science, we've fallen in one generation from first to ninth in college graduates.  That's unacceptable.  And we're paying a terrible price today with a tough economy because we've lost our way educationally.  That's why we're pushing so hard for reform."
147,"MR. GREGORY:  It's important to point out, as well, there's a lot of money in the reform movement right now.  You got most of it.  You got billions of dollars as Education secretary to give as part of Race to the Top.  President Bush, who started No Child Left Behind, that will be reauthorized, you hope, certainly.  Where are we with those?  Because you're giving money, but there's a lot more conditions to really drive accountability."
148,"SEC'Y DUNCAN:  Well, to be clear, we're not investing in the status quo.  So with Race to the Top, which actually represents less than 1, less than 1 percent of total K to 12 spending nationally, you see 36 states raising standards, not dumbing down things, not lying to children anymore because of political pressure.  You see most states removing barriers to innovative schools.  We've seen every single state eliminate the linking of teacher evaluation and student achievement.  It's remarkable, remarkable progress encouraged at the local level.  That's what we're investing in, great leadership, great courage at the local level."
149,"MR. GREGORY:  I, I want to talk throughout this about, not just raising problems, but talking about solutions, because I feel like we dwell on the problems so often it's not always constructive."
150,"Michelle Rhee, there's a political storm in Washington about education and about the mayor losing his primary, and I'll get to that in just a minute. But I want to start with you and ask you what's working since you've been chancellor?  What's the good news?"
151,"MS. MICHELLE RHEE:  Well, the good news is what we've shown over the last three and a half years in Washington, D.C., is that if you prioritize education, if you make it the number one issue in the city, if you have the political leadership and the courage to make tough decisions, that you can see tremendous progress in a short period of time.  Over the last three years we've gone from being, you know, worst, you know, amongst all urban jurisdictions in the country to actually leading the nation in gains in our progress of students on the NAEP examination in both reading and math.  So, I think, it basically shows that if you have, if you have a, a, a singular focus and you really are prioritizing, making those tough decisions, that, that progress can, can result."
152,"MR. GREGORY:  And, Mr. Robb, what are you finding in Detroit about what's working right now?"
153,"MR. ROBERT BOBB:  Well, a lot of things that are working in Detroit.  I think I'd like to go back to what Secretary Duncan mentioned, and that is, although our state did not win in the Race to the Top competition, considerable reforms were advanced by the governor and the state legislature and the secretary of--I mean the, the superintendent of public instructions.  And so we are implementing those programs, although we do not have the, the funding in place.  In particular, more time spent with, with our teachers and, and, and, an additional expanded day for our students, and much more rigor that we're putting in our classrooms so that we can, we can compete in the 21st century."
154,"MR. GREGORY:  Randi Weingarten, I want to go back, all the way back to 2002 and No Child Left Behind and President Bush and listen again to how he framed what has become the major driver in the reform movement, and that is accountability.  Watch this."
155,"(Videotape, January 8, 2002)"
156,PRES. GEORGE W. BUSH:  I understand taking tests aren't fun.  Too bad.  We need to know in America.  We need to know whether or not children have got the basic education.
157,No longer is it acceptable to hide poor performance.  No longer is it acceptable to keep results away from parents.
158,(End videotape)
159,"MR. GREGORY:  And President Bush isn't often given credit for driving accountability because No Child Left Behind became unpopular.  And yet, indeed, that accountability is what the Obama administration has built on. As--is accountability, at the core of this, working?"
160,"MS. RANDI WEINGARTEN:  So, you know, President Bush was right.  Tests aren't fun, but they're absolutely imperative to do.  But what happened when No Child Left Behind was, it all, it became all about the tests as opposed to about teaching and learning.  So accountability is essential as a tool, not as a goal.  The goal is, how do help 50 million school children in the United States of America get a great education.  And so, ultimately, we need to have a couple of other tools like engaged, robust curriculum, like a real focus on teacher development, like a real overhauling of the teacher evaluation system. And if we look at what the countries that have outcompete--that outcompete us do, is that there's a huge investment in teachers as well as looking at accountability.  Accountability, absolutely essential; top to bottom accountability as well as bottom to top.  But it's not the whole story."
161,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, but let's be specific then.  Michelle Rhee, in Washington, D.C., you closed schools, you fired teachers.  There was a lot of controversy around that.  Randi, if you believe in accountability, what happened in Washington--Michelle, you start--when you did fire teachers and close down schools that weren't performing?"
162,"MS. RHEE:  Well, we certainly got a tremendous amount of pushback.  And I think that Superintendent Bobb knows this as well.  You know, people are uncomfortable when you change what is currently in place.  And so what we looked at over the last three and a half years, for example, we closed 23 schools in the first year, we've closed several schools after that because we cannot continue to pour the same amount of resources into a faulty system. We, we were shrinking in terms of the number of students that were coming to school every day in DCPS, but we never downsized the number of schools that we had.  The result of that is that we were spreading our resources way too thin and the, the--we were--the, the citizens and the students weren't feeling the amount of money that we were spending every single day."
163,"You know, in terms of the teacher accountability, yes, we've been--we've held a very, very high bar.  We've said it's no longer going to be acceptable for teachers who are ineffective to stay in the classroom.  And, you know, we've gotten a tremendous amount of pushback about that.  And I think--I mean, you said we were going to talk about the election.  But if you talk about the mayor's election, a lot of what you heard from citizens was, ""Well, they fire teachers."" And what you, unfortunately, didn't hear about that was we didn't fire teachers to be mean, because were callous or didn't care.  We wanted to remove ineffective teachers from the classroom simply because we think our children deserve better."
164,"MR. GREGORY:  And you talk about accountability, and yet the teachers unions, you say they don't--you shouldn't be demonized, but you just, you sue the district when, when there is accountability, when teachers get fired.  Is that, is that the constructive response?"
165,"MS. WEINGARTEN:  Actually, you know, the last suit that we did was actually about trying to find out the basis upon why--which some of the teachers were fired.  And, ultimately, we're still waiting to get the FOIL request and things like that, the Freedom of Information request.  But at the bottom of this, David and Michelle, we changed the contract to make it more transparent and cohesive, to give Michelle and the district more tools on teacher quality. We gave the teachers more tools, we gave the district more tools."
166,"The issue in terms of us is to make sure that teachers get the tools and conditions they need to be effective and to make sure that there's fairness. We know the teacher tenure system is broken, and we want to fix it.  There are different ways we fixed it in Detroit, working with the district there; different ways we fixed it in, in Washington; different ways we fixed it throughout the country.  So the issue is how do we make teachers effective? And also, with all due respect, how do we give the good teachers--there's three million teachers in the United States of America and 133,000 schools. How do we give those quiet, unsung heroes the tools and conditions they need to help all children?"
167,"MS. RHEE:  But with all due respect, let me say that we, you know, in addition to identifying the ineffective teachers who needed to be terminated, we also identified 16 percent of the teachers in D.C. who we rated as highly effective, and we said to them, ""We are going to recognize and reward your work.  We're going to compensate you at the level that you deserve to be compensated at."" So, with our new contract now, we will be able to pay the most effective teachers who are teaching in high poverty areas and in high need subject areas nearly double the amount that they were previously making. So we are going to use the approach of making sure that the best people are rewarded.  But we also have to have the flip side of that, which is, ""If you are not effective, then you can no longer be in the classroom."""
168,"MR. GREGORY:  Secretary Duncan, what happened in Washington, D.C., that concerns you?  Mayor Fenty did not win for re-election in his primary."
169,SEC'Y DUNCAN:  Right.
170,"MR. GREGORY:  There's a real question--and I guess, Michelle, I should ask you, are you going to stay as chancellor of D.C. schools?"
171,"MS. RHEE:  Well, I think that's something that we still have to determine. And I have to talk to Vincent Gray, who is the, the, the presumptive mayor. But I think the important thing to realize is that education reform can continue in D.C., regardless of whether I'm there or not.  It can continue as long as the leadership is willing to continue to make the incredibly tough decisions that we've made over the last three years."
172,"MR. GREGORY:  It's--but, Secretary Duncan, this is a political question, but it's germane.  You didn't campaign at all for Mary--for Adrian Fenty, the mayor.  You said you don't do politics.  And yet this past week, you said you would campaign for congressional Democrats in the midterm election.  Why didn't you campaign for Fenty when the blowback against teacher accountability can be so severe in some of these local districts?"
173,"SEC'Y DUNCAN:  Right.  Well, I'm, I'm a huge fan of what he and Michelle have done.  By any measure, the public schools in D.C. are dramatically better today than when they started.  I stood with Mayor Fenty multiple times.  I invested $75 million in the district because of its leadership.  And he can walk out with his head held high.  When the story of D.C.'s school reform is written, a huge part is going to be around his courage and his leadership. There are thousands of local primaries around the country, I can't weigh in on every single one.  There are national candidates that I need to support who are going to drive school reform.  But Mayor, Mayor Fenty did, I think, a remarkable job of dramatically improving the quality of education in D.C."
174,MR. GREGORY:  But let me just stop you.
175,"Mr. Bobb, this is one of the issues that, that reformers talk about.  You can't denationalize this, this effort.  I mean, what happened in Washington, D.C.--and the unions were a part of this in terms of opposing what the mayor and, and Michelle Rhee did--if you--if we make it about individual jurisdictions, the unions are very powerful.  Those who, who oppose some of these reforms in the status quo are powerful.  Is it good enough for national leaders to step back and allow the individual districts to have at it themselves?  Can you prevail and reform when it's this tough?  You know what it's like in the school district."
176,"MR. BOBB:  It's very tough.  I think that national leaders have to be involved and engaged at the local level as well.  I mean, the reform movement, what we're doing in Detroit cannot take place without very strong support from, let's say, Governor Granholm, Mike Flanagan; in Michelle's case, Adrian Fenty.  Every major decision that I have made, I have been sued either by local leaders, school board members.  And there is a sense of urgency in these urban school districts.  You cannot sit back and let children--and not take care of what, what's needed for children, particularly more rigor in the classrooms, more effective leaders--not just teachers effective leaders.  I mean, I, I moved 51 principals this year alone.  The school leadership at the building is significantly as important as the teachers that we put before our children in the classrooms."
177,"I mean, I know that Michelle went through the process of closing schools in, in Washington, D.C.  We--in 2000, we had 167,000 students in the Detroit public schools.  Today we're educating about 84,000, 85,000 students.  In the two years that I've been the emergency financial manager, we've closed 59 schools.  It is very difficult politically, it's hard on a community, and it's also challenging for parents and students."
178,"MR. GREGORY:  All right, and we're going to take a quick break here. We're--and then we're going to come back and I want to talk specifically about what is really at the core of this debate, which is how do we make sure we get the very best teachers in front of our students, and how does accountability achieve that?  We'll talk about both sides of that when we're back with our panel right after this brief station break."
179,                               (Announcements)
180,"MR. GREGORY:  And we're back, live from 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York, to continue our discussion about public school education."
181,"Randi Weingarten, I want to get to this issue of how we get the best teachers in front of our students.  And let's get right to this point.  I'm a parent, I have three young kids.  If I go into my child's classroom and I'm basically told, ""Look, this teacher's really not doing that well, but we want to give them another year, see how they do this year.  We want to try to develop them a little bit, so maybe by, you know, maybe not in this year, but maybe next year, things will get better."" That's not good enough for me as a parent."
182,MS. WEINGARTEN:  Right.
183,"MR. GREGORY:  So show me--tell me specifically what you representing teachers across the country have done to avoid that reality when it appears that, in fact, the unions have said to people like Michelle Rhee, you can't get rid of these people, you can't just fire them willy-nilly if you don't have the right results.  You're demonizing the teachers."
184,"MS. WEINGARTEN:  So that result, when an administrator says that to a parent, is not good for anyone.  Teachers don't want it, parents don't want it.  And, ultimately, what we need to do is we need to invest in teachers from the moment that they go into teacher preparation until every single day that they're in a classroom.  Most of us--I don't know, you know, Michelle has told these stories about when she started to teach, I've told these stories of when I started to teach, I wasn't a very good teacher my first year.  I was a better teacher my second and third years.  So there's going to be some investment lag that happens in terms of teachers."
185,"MR. GREGORY:  But, Randi, we're not talking about a learning curve here. We're not talking about starting out teachers, Michelle.  We're talking about teachers who have been in the system for a long time..."
186,MS. WEINGARTEN:  Sure.
187,"MR. GREGORY:  ...who have failed to perform year after year, and yet, frankly, removing them is the hardest part."
188,SEC'Y DUNCAN:  Right.
189,"MS. WEINGARTEN:  So let me, let me just go right to that.  No one wants a bad teacher, David.  Not teachers, not parents.  When I asked our members this question, overwhelmingly they want us to find the tools and conditions to help teachers do better.  And what we've tried to do now, what we've realized, is that the evaluation system is totally and completely broken in the United States.  So our union has tried to invest in creating a new evaluation system. There's about 50 or 60 districts that are trying to do that.  We've tried to figure out who is good, who is not.  If they're not good, we help them.  If we can't help them, we have to weed them out of the profession.  You're absolutely right..."
190,"MR. GREGORY:  But is that happening, is my question."
191,"MS. WEINGARTEN:  It is now starting--you know, it is now starting to happen in the last two years in a greater rate than we've ever seen before."
192,"MR. GREGORY:  But I want to give Michelle a chance to respond.  Is that happening from the--you've been head of schools, is that how you see it?"
193,"MS. RHEE:  I mean, let's be honest that, first of all, our new evaluation system where we actually use student achievement data, how much a student progresses, to determine whether or not a, a, a teacher is, is effective or not, we implemented that because we have the power within the district to implement whatever evaluation tool we want.  So we, we got a lot of pushback, and we still get, get tremendous pushback from the, from the unions.  So, for example, we just identified about 241 educators of this last summer who were, were not effective or did not have the proper certification, etc.  And when we did that and then said, for the ineffective teachers, people who got that on their evaluation, through a robust evaluation, looking at multiple things, ""You are now being terminated,"" then we get slapped with this, you know, huge class-action grievance, basically, saying, you know, ""We're grieving the way that you did this."" But the bottom line is that if these people are ineffective, and if, as President Weingarten says, nobody wants ineffective teachers in the classroom, then you can't fight us every step of the way when we're moving in that direction."
194,MR. GREGORY:  What...
195,"MS. WEINGARTEN:  But, David, we are not..."
196,"MR. GREGORY:  Well, let me, let me, Secretary Duncan, let's, let's--what do you see..."
197,SEC'Y DUNCAN:  Right.
198,"MR. GREGORY:  ...in the sense of the overall here?  Because this is really the core, isn't this?"
199,"SEC'Y DUNCAN:  That's right.  It is the core.  And let's just take a step back.  The status quo isn't working for children, and it's not working for the country.  And what the president fundamentally gets is we have to educate our way to a better economy.  What do we do?  We have to reward excellence in, in education, we have to reward great teachers, and we have to be much more strategic in how we get great principals and great teachers to go to historically underserved communities.  We have to provide much better support for teachers who are trying to become world class; and those teachers where it's simply not working, we have to be much more swift in how we move them out.  So it's not working at any levels.  It's not working for the stars, it's not working for those in the middle, it's not working for those on the bottom. If it's not working for any adults, it's definitely not working for the children in this country."
200,"MR. GREGORY:  Mr. Bobb, this is in part a policy question, in part a political question.  As you've looked at, say, what Michelle Rhee has done in Washington with Mayor Fenty, how can they better implement accountability in a way that keeps in mind that there are a lot of teachers, a lot of communities like Detroit, like Washington, D.C., that rely upon those jobs?  We're in a severe economic recession.  How do administrators go about accountability in a way that doesn't create the political blowback, whether it's lawsuits or whether it's political blowback at the polls?"
201,"MR. BOBB:  Well, definitely you have to have--you have to be able to communicate these issues.  What it is what you're doing has to be communicated, how you're doing it has to be communicated, and then what processes you're going to put in place to help individuals succeed.  And those who do not succeed, they have to leave the system immediately."
202,SEC'Y DUNCAN:  David...
203,"MS. WEINGARTEN:  But, David..."
204,"MR. BOBB:  I mean, we just--in Detroit public schools, we just--we have a new teacher contract.  And this year, for the first time, we actually have a new teacher evaluation system that's being put in place."
205,MR. GREGORY:  Mm-hmm.
206,"MR. BOBB:  We're, we're borrowing from what's being done in D.C., we're borrowing from what's being done in, in Denver.  And those--we have to have an effective way in which we can evaluate teachers.  But you know what..."
207,SEC'Y DUNCAN:  David...
208,"MS. WEINGARTEN:  David, let..."
209,MR. BOBB:  ...it's not just the evaluation of teachers.
210,MS. WEINGARTEN:  Right.
211,MR. GREGORY:  OK.
212,MR. BOBB:  We have to look at the entire system.
213,MS. WEINGARTEN:  Right.
214,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
215,MS. WEINGARTEN:  Yes.  David...
216,MR. BOBB:  We have to look from principals to everyone through that whole school.
217,MS. WEINGARTEN:  That...
218,MR. GREGORY:  Secretary Duncan.
219,"SEC'Y DUNCAN:  We need dramatic change.  Let's, let's be real honest here. What was going on in Washington for decades was an absolute disgrace for children.  What's been going on in Detroit for far too long is a disgrace. Those children in both cities had been desperately, desperately underserved. Change is hard.  There is going to be blowback.  When you challenge the status quo, that is difficult, but we have to have the moral courage to do the right thing by our children, and we have to give the children of Detroit a chance. Detroit's going in a much better direction, thanks to, to Superintendent Bobb's leadership.  Washington's going the right direction.  Change is going to continue to be hard.  We'll continue to get pushback..."
220,MS. WEINGARTEN:  And...
221,SEC'Y DUNCAN:  ...but we have to keep going forward.
222,MR. GREGORY:  And so...
223,MS. WEINGARTEN:  And in most...
224,MR. GREGORY:  Yeah.
225,"MS. WEINGARTEN:  And in both of those places, David, in both of those places, even though it was hard, the union stepped up and did a contract with Robert Bobb.  The union stepped up and did a contract with Michelle Rhee.  The union sometimes asks to make sure that things are not arbitrary and capricious, but let me ask, let me ask--say this as well, there are many other districts like the ABC District in Los Angeles, like the New Haven District, where the union has stepped up with managers who want to work with us, where we are making that kind of change.  So the issue is, for us, about insuring that we do the some--some of the things that the secretary said, because it's not just about the issue of looking at a snapshot of whether a teacher is bad or good.  It's about developing teachers.  It's about not spending the $7 billion that we spend right now..."
226,MR. GREGORY:  Right.  But let's just...
227,"MS. WEINGARTEN:  ...in teacher turnover.  We have to do things that help kids every single day in classrooms, which means investing in teachers like they do in the countries that outpace us."
228,MR. GREGORY:  All right.  Hold on.  I want to bring up the Colorado law about evaluation of teachers.  And really the crux of it is it's a tough law.  You supported it.
229,MS. WEINGARTEN:  Correct.
230,"MR. GREGORY:  Of course, you don't represent a lot of teachers out there, so the political stakes were not, frankly, as high for you."
231,MS. WEINGARTEN:  Actually...
232,"MR. GREGORY:  Hold on one a second.  That's a reality, because you represent a lot more teachers in other districts, and we all know that.  But what they did there is have tougher evaluations and said, ""After two years, you could be removed."" Do you support that as a national model?"
233,"MS. WEINGARTEN:  We support--if you help teachers be the best they can be and evaluate them fairly, then if they have to be removed, they have to be removed.  The one thing we want is to not throw the baby out with the bath water.  Ultimately, we have to fix the due process system to make sure that it's not glacial process.  We have to fix the evaluation system, but more importantly, we have to give teachers and kids the supports they need so that they can grow, and that's what happens in the countries that out compete us."
234,SEC'Y DUNCAN:  David...
235,"MR. GREGORY:  I want to ask one question.  Mr. Secretary, you can make your point, too, I want to address what Mark Zuckerberg has done with Facebook, $100 million to the Newark City schools.  It's tremendous, but what is the role of that private money?  Because I've talked to business leaders who say, you know, ""Look, we're only operating on the fringes here, a lot of money. You can't deal with some of the core problems."" And money, as we've talked about, is really not the big issue here."
236,SEC'Y DUNCAN:  Change is the issue.
237,MR. GREGORY:  Right.
238,"SEC'Y DUNCAN:  And we're seeing whether it's Mark in Silicon Valley or the phenomenal movie ""Waiting for `Superman'"" from Hollywood, the country is starting to take notice.  The country.  You guys, a couple days summit on education.  This has become the national topic.  People know we have to educate our way to a better economy.  That money invested in the status quo is throwing good money after bad.  That money to drive fundamental change and reform, just like Race to the Top, it's going to lead the country where we need to go.  So that generosity, that investment from a private sector, it might not seem like a lot of money.  Our Race to the Top, $4 billion sounds like a lot.  We spend $650 billion a year on K to 12 education.  Less than 1 percent is changing the country.  Mark's money in Newark, other money in Detroit, Washington, Chicago, right here in New York, L.A., that private money, all of us have to invest.  The parents, the business community, philanthropy, all of us need to be investing in public education."
239,"MR. GREGORY:  I've, I've got a minute 30, and, Michelle, I'll come to you first on this.  I walked out of the film ""Waiting for `Superman,'"" and my first reaction was as a parent.  And I ask myself, not as the moderator of this program but as a parent, what am I going to do to help?  What can the individual who is moved by this do to make some a difference, so we're not just scratching our head and saying, ""Gosh, this is so hard""?"
240,"MS. RHEE:  Yeah.  That, I think, is the fundamental question.  People have been asking me that, you know, since, since they've been viewing the movie. And I think what we need, quite frankly, is a national movement around this, so that people, it doesn't matter if they live in, in Idaho or New York or, or California, who want--who, who are watching the movie and saying, ""This is absolutely wrong.  We're doing an injustice to our kids.  How can we do better?"" We actually need a national movement of people, you know, whether it's giving $10 or whether it's Mark Zuckerberg who's giving $100 million.  I mean, the money that we got from our external funders really did leverage--provide us with the leverage that we needed to sign this revolutionary contract.  And now it's having reverberations across the country.  And I think that people can't underestimate how much a phone call to a politician, you know, dollars invested can really help to see some major changing."
241,"MR. GREGORY:  All right.  We're going to have to leave it there.  The other piece of advice I got is, you know, if you drive by a public school, even if your kids don't go there, walk in and ask how you can help, whether you can tutor or provide resources to a teacher."
242,MS. RHEE:  Absolutely.
243,MR. GREGORY:  I think there's a lot we can do just on that baseline level.
244,Thanks to all of you.  A conversation that will continue here at NBC News for the week and around the country for sure.  Thank you all very much.
245,We'll take a break.  We'll be right back.
246,(Announcements)
247,"MR. GREGORY:  Programming note before we go.  Stay tuned to NBC News and MSNBC all week for more on Education Nation.  Brian Williams will moderate a special teacher town hall today at noon Eastern on MSNBC.  Plus, President Obama sits down with Matt Lauer on the ""Today"" program tomorrow."
248,"And a special Web extra we want to tell you about on our Web site today to mark the 50th anniversary of the great debates of 1960.  We teamed up with the University of Virginia's Center for Politics to present a special discussion on those historic and first-of-their-kind presidential debates between Vice President Richard Nixon and then Senator John F.  Kennedy, one of which took place in NBC's Washington studio that is now the home of MEET THE PRESS when we're actually back at our home studio.  We talked to journalists and staffers who were part of history 50 years ago about what happened behind the scenes and the significance of those debates on our political landscape today.  It's all on our Web site at mtp.msnbc.com.  You can also follow me on Twitter at David Gregory, as well, for more on that and other topics."
249,"That is all for today.  We'll be off next week for NBC sports coverage of the Ryder Cup golf tournament, but we'll be back the following week.  If it's Sunday, it's MEET THE PRESS."

MR. GREGORY:
We're here in 
New York
. Congressman 
Pence
, good to have you here with me on, on our breezy set here this morning. We'll be able to get through that. I want to get to the 
pledge
 and its contents and this whole debate about whether these are new ideas or not...
"
264,"
REP. MIKE PENCE (R-IN):
Right.
"
265,"
MR. GREGORY:
...in just a moment. But, Congressman 
Van Hollen
 and Congressman 
Pence
, I want to start on the narrow issue of 
tax cuts
 and the big 
tax cut
 debate that is part of this midterm 
campaign
. We know, Congressman 
Van Hollen
, that the 
Senate
 has kicked off the decision -- kicked it back, I should say, till after the elections to take on whether or not the 
Bush tax cuts
 should be extended. What will the 
House
 do on this important question?
"
266,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:
Well, 
David
, the 
House
 will vote before these 
tax cuts
 expire at the end of the year. Whether we vote before the 
election
 or not is something we'll take a look at. But I want to be very clear as to what the stakes are here because what the 
Republicans
 have said is that they're going to hold tax 
relief
 for 98 percent of the 
American people
 hostage until they can get permanent 
tax breaks
 for the top 2 percent, even though that would blow a $700 billion hole in the 
deficit
, something that would be added to the 
credit cards
 of our 
children
 and grandchildren, and slow down 
economic growth
 and jobs going 
forward
.
"
267,"
MR. GREGORY:
But what about the timing? Because you say it's probably not till after the 
election
. I've talked to economists, read their words this week, who say the longer you wait the more uncertainty. Why not put it to a vote before the midterms?
"
268,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:
Well, we are absolutely going to get this done before the end of the year. We may well take it up before the midterms. But, as you've heard from 
Mitch McConnell
, the 
Senate Republican leader
, they are insisting on holding the 
tax cuts
 for most of the 
American people
 hostage until they get these breaks for the very top. And we don't think that we should be adding $700 billion to our 
deficit
. That's fiscally reckless at a time that we need to be imposing some 
fiscal discipline
. We should not be adding red ink that's going to have to be picked up by others and, and put us more in hock to 
China
 and other countries.
"
269,"
MR. GREGORY:
OK. All right, Congressman 
Pence
, you can...
"
270,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:
That just does not make 
sense
.
"
271,"
MR. GREGORY:
...you can take on the substance of that. But first, answer this question about the time, maybe, because this is where the news is, should the 
House
 take this up before the midterm vote?
"
272,"
REP. PENCE:

David
, there is no question that there should be no higher priority for the 
Congress of the United States
 today than making sure that no American sees a tax increase in January of 
2011
, not one. I, I, I have to tell you, this, for all the world, seems like a moment where 
Congress
 is putting politics ahead of prosperity. You know, it -- what, what they're proposing here, even a -- even if they found some way to just extend 
middle class
 tax 
relief
, would be an enormous tax increase in January on job creators in this 
country
. You know, higher taxes won't get people hired. 
Raising taxes
 on job creators won't create jobs, and the 
American people
 know that. But let me say one last thing. I, I...
"
273,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:

David
...
"
274,"
REP. PENCE:
...I think it would be unconscionable for this 
Congress
 to adjourn without giving the bipartisan majority in the 
Congress
 that wants to extend all current tax 
relief
 an 
up or down vote
.
"
275,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right. But let me ask you this because this is a key question.
"
276,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:

David
 -- wait, 
David
.
"
277,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah, hold on, Congressman, I'll get right back to you. But I want to ask this key question. In this 
Pledge
 to 
America
 that...
"
278,"
REP. PENCE:
Right.
"
279,"
MR. GREGORY:
...that we'll talk about in, in greater detail in just a moment, is this commitment to bringing down the 
deficit
.
"
280,"
REP. PENCE:
Right.
"
281,"
MR. GREGORY:
As well as extending the 
tax cuts
. How do you answer the charge from 
Democrats
, from the president as well, that you don't have a way to pay for extending the 
tax cuts
, and yet you're committed to 
deficit
 reduction?
"
282,"
REP. PENCE:
Well, look, in the 
Pledge
 to 
America
, which I look 
forward
 to chatting about, we say, look, we've got to do something to get this 
economy
 moving again. We give real and meaningful proposals to begin the process of reining in runaway 
federal
 spending by both 
political parties
...
"
283,"
MR. GREGORY:
But, but how do you pay for the 
tax cuts
 is the question.
"
284,"
REP. PENCE:
...and reforming the 
government
. Look, job one needs to be to create jobs. The American people know the last thing you want to do in the worst 
economy
 in 25 years is raise taxes on 
small business
 owners and family farmers. We have to vote before 
Congress
 adjourns for the 
political
 season, the fall elections, on an 
up or down vote
. More than 30 
Democrats
 support extending all the current tax 
relief
. And, and we're calling on 
Speaker Pelosi
 and leaders like 
Chris
, give us an 
up or down vote
, let the 
Congress
 work its will and give the 
American people
 certainty...
"
285,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:

Dave
...
"
286,"
MR. GREGORY:
Congressman 
Van Hollen
, go ahead.
"
287,"
REP. PENCE:
...that there will be no tax increase.
"
288,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:

David
, this notion that 
Mike
's talking about, that you need to have these 
tax breaks
 for the very top to create jobs and 
economic expansion
, 
Mike
, those tax rights are in effect right now. They're in effect right now. I don't see all this 
job creation
 as a result of those 
tax cuts
. They've been in effect for nine years. At the end of those nine years, we've seen losses of millions of jobs. So this, this story that somehow those breaks for the very folks at the top create these jobs is, is just nonsense. 
And I
 want to make one other point because they have...
"
289,"
REP. PENCE:
Well, but the -- there's no question...
"
290,"
MR. GREGORY:
Hold on. Go ahead. Go ahead.
"
291,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:
...they have -- they -- one other point. They have tried to mask this as an issue with 
small businesses
. Well, it turns out that only 2 percent of 
small businesses
 are affected. And when you look at the definition of 
small businesses
, you find that they're big hedge funds, big 
Washington
 lobbying firms, 
KKR
, 
Pricewaterhouse
. Because, under the definition of 
tax code
, anything that's an S corporation qualifies. So I want 
Mike
 to tell us whether he really believes that 
KKR
, whether 
Pricewaterhouse
, whether those are the kind of 
small businesses
 that need help? Because that's the folks that they're trying to help out. We don't...
"
292,"
MR. GREGORY:
I want to ask a different question about taxes.
"
293,"
REP. PENCE:
Well, well, look...
"
294,"
MR. GREGORY:
Wait a minute, I want to...
"
295,"
REP. PENCE:
Can I respond to that, though?
"
296,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, in just...
"
297,"
REP. PENCE:
I think he makes a very good point.
"
298,"
MR. GREGORY:
OK, go ahead.
"
299,"
REP. PENCE:
If the current tax 
relief
 was enough to get this 
economy
 moving again, the 
economy
 would be moving and it's not. What, what 
Chris
 and the 
Democrats
 in 
Congress
 and the 
administration
 continue to insist on is a tax increase in January of 
2011
. But I want to stipulate to the point. That's why 
Republicans
, in the 
Pledge
 to 
America
, called for a 20 percent business deduction on all business income immediately, to be voted on in this 
Congress
. We think there needs to be more pro-growth tax 
relief
 to get the 
economy
 moving again. But, for heaven sakes, let's not raise taxes on job creators.
"
300,"
MR. GREGORY:
All right, but let me ask you a bigger question about 
tax cuts
 or tax hikes. You say in the 
Pledge
 to 
America
 that you want to bring spending down to 
2008
 levels, which you well know is not enough to really seriously tackle the 
deficit
, even if you bring it back to 
2008
. So the question for you, and I'll ask Congressman 
Van Hollen
, how can you rule out tax hikes as we move 
forward
 if you want to get serious about tackling the 
deficit
?
"
301,"
REP. PENCE:
Well, look, I, I -- number one, I think you rule out tax increases because our problem isn't that the 
American people
 are taxed too little, our problem is that 
Washington
 spends too much. In the 
Pledge
 to 
America
 we call for cutting 
discretionary spending
 to pre- stimulus, pre-bailout levels, cutting the amount of funding allocated to 
Congress
, freezing all pay on nonsecurity 
federal
 employees, ending 
federal
 control of 
Fannie Mae
 and 
Freddie Mac
, ending 
TARP
. That'd save a trillion 
dollars
 over 10 years alone. And, you know, reducing 
discretionary spending
 back to those 
2008
 levels, that would be -- I mean, that would save $100 billion this year.
"
302,"
MR. GREGORY:
That's fine, but that doesn't...
"
303,"
REP. PENCE:
We, we can get there through 
fiscal discipline
 and 
reform
.
"
304,"
MR. GREGORY:
...that really doesn't tackle the 
deficit
 completely. Congressman 
Van Hollen
, the question for you and for 
Democrats
, can you rule out tax hikes as we move 
forward
 to be serious about cutting the 
deficit
?
"
305,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:
I'm sorry, 
David
, what was the question? I couldn't hear you.
"
306,"
MR. GREGORY:
Can you -- do you really rule out tax increases not just for the 
wealthiest Americans
, but even for the 
middle class
, if we're going to get serious about dealing with the 
deficit
?
"
307,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:
Yeah. Yeah, we think it would be a 
big mistake
 to raise taxes on 98 percent of the 
American people
. 
And I
 want to go back to this point that 
Mike
 raised about 
small businesses
. The president and the 
Democrats
 have proposed 
tax cuts
 for 
small businesses
 to generate new activity. In fact, the president's just said let's provide 100 percent write-off for investments made between now and 
2011
. And what was interesting was they had this big ceremony for the 
pledge
 at a 
small business
 site, within hours they came back to the 
Hill
 and voted against the 
Small Business Lending Bill
 which, in addition to increasing access to credit for 
small businesses
, contains significant 
tax cuts
. And Senator 
Voinovich
, who's a retiring Republican senator said it's time for the 
Republicans
 to stop playing politics when the 
American people
 are hurting. 
And I
 hope they will begin to do that because...
"
308,"
MR. GREGORY:
Let...
"
309,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:
...they violated their 
pledge
 within hours about cutting taxes to 
small businesses
.
"
310,"
MR. GREGORY:
You know, as you go back to 
1994
, Congressman 
Pence
, there was the 
Contract with America
, and one of the big issues, if you go back even to interviews I've done with Republican leaders till after the 
election
 of 
President Obama
, was that this wanted to be the party of new ideas.
"
311,"
REP. PENCE:
Right.
"
312,"
MR. GREGORY:
And, in fact, this, this 
pledge
 has been criticized for being anything but new. Where satire is most 
effective
, 
Jon Stewart
 on ""
The Daily Show
"" this week raised this issue by comparing some of what was said in 
1998
 by 
Speaker
 -- rather, who wants to be speaker, 
Boehner
, 
John Boehner
, to what he said in unveiling the 
pledge
. And this is what it looked like.
"
313,"

"
314,"
REP. JOHN BOEHNER:
A smaller...
"
315,"
A smaller...
"
316,"
...less costly...
"
317,"
...less costly...
"
318,"
...and more accountable...
"
319,"
...and more accountable...
"
320,"
...
government
 in our 
nation
's capital.
"
321,"
MR. JON STEWART:
Wow. That's -- I don't even know what to say. This thing's not even a sequel. It's like a shot-by-shot remake of your -- I thought the 
pledge
 was you were humbled and going to come back with fresh new ideas. Wasn't that the 
pledge
?
"
322,"

"
323,"
MR. GREGORY:
So what's new here?
"
324,"
REP. PENCE:
Well, ending bailouts and cutting spending in 
Washington
, 
D.C.
, is a new idea, 
David
. And the truth is, look, 
Republicans
 didn't just lose our majority in 
2006
, we lost our way. We walked away from the principles of 
fiscal discipline
 and 
reform
 that minted our governing majority back in 
1980
 and again in 
1994
, and the 
American people
 walked away from us. What, what we have in this proposal is not, not necessarily new. The idea of 
fiscal responsibility
, pro-growth policies, openness and transparency in 
government
 are solid, American ideas. What 
Republicans
 are committing to in this 
Pledge
 to 
America
 is taking important first steps in this 
Congress
 to steer our 
national government
 back to those basic practices and principles.
"
325,"
MR. GREGORY:
Congressman 
Van Hollen
, do you agree? Is this a return to core principles or is this a rehash?
"
326,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:
Look, this is a rehash. It's a recycling of the 
Bush
 economic agenda. They put a new 
front page
 on it, but otherwise this is a 
Xerox
 copy. Their whole answer to everything seems to be give the folks at the very top a 
tax break
, and then they want to undo the regulations and reforms on 
Wall Street
. I mean, the problems on 
Wall Street
 led to catastrophe around the 
country
, millions of people lost their jobs, and they're trying to do what lobbyists tried very hard to do, but didn't succeed, which is to say, ""Let's put those guys back in charge."" 
And I
 -- it is a return to the 
Bush
 economic agenda. There's 
no doubt about it
.
"
327,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, 
let me follow
 up...
"
328,"
REP. PENCE:

David
, 
David
...
"
329,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:
I would point out...
"
330,"
MR. GREGORY:

Let me follow
 up on this point.
"
331,"
REP. PENCE:

"
332,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:
...this is not...
"
333,"
MR. GREGORY:
Congressman 
Pence
, hold on, 
let me follow
 up on this point...
"
334,"
REP. PENCE:
Yeah.
"
335,"
MR. GREGORY:
...which is where you think this is a credible economic argument. You voted against 
TARP
. You opposed the stimulus, as did other Republican leaders. And yet people, economists who have looked at this from both sides of the aisle, 
Robert Samuelson
 writing in 
Newsweek
 who is a more conservative columnist on economic matters, says that the aggressive actions taken, going back to 
TARP
 and then followed through by this 
administration
, most definitely had an impact on 
GDP
, on the fact that we don't see unemployment approaching 16 percent. Is it credible for 
Republicans
 to ask for the vote this November when, effectively, you would've let the 
financial system
 teeter off the edge of a cliff?
"
336,"
REP. PENCE:
Well, it -- look, 
Republicans
 weren't prepared to let the 
financial system
 teeter off a cliff.
"
337,"
MR. GREGORY:
You voted against 
TARP
.
"
338,"
REP. PENCE:
We just thought taking $700 billion...
"
339,"
MR. GREGORY:
What would've happened if, if you had not passed 
TARP
?
"
340,"
REP. PENCE:
Well, 
David
, we just thought taking $700 billion from 
Main Street
 and transferring it to 
Wall Street
 was a profoundly bad idea.
"
341,"
MR. GREGORY:
That's good rhetoric, but what would've happened to the 
financial system
?
"
342,"
REP. PENCE:
Now we...
"
343,"
MR. GREGORY:
Who in the 
financial system
 thinks it didn't stabilize the 
system
?
"
344,"
REP. PENCE:
Yeah, look. 
Republicans
, 
Republicans
 had a proposal, it was a backstop, not a handout. It -- we could've, we could've worked out this as a lot of the post-mortem analysis suggested we could. Look, this is not a choice between the failed 
economic policies
 of the present and the failed 
economic policies
 of the past. I know that the 
Democrats
 want to frame it that way. What 
Republicans
 are saying is we have to get back, we have to end the era of borrowing and spending and bailouts and 
government
 takeovers. We have to repeal 
Obama
 care lock, stock, and barrel, oppose their cap and trade schemes, and then we've got to get back to the practice of 
fiscal responsibility
 and the kind of policies that'll get this 
economy
 growing again.
"
345,"
MR. GREGORY:
Name me one painful choice on spending the 
Republicans
 are prepared to make, that there could be some real blowback for politically, that they'll stand by if they want to reduce the 
deficit
 and rein in spending?
"
346,"
REP. PENCE:
Well, look, I, look, I, you know...
"
347,"
MR. GREGORY:
I read through this. I want to know where is the painful choice that you're prepared to make on spending?
"
348,"
REP. PENCE:
Look, I, I never thought you'd ask. Look, cutting 
discretionary spending
.
"
349,"
MR. GREGORY:
On what?
"
350,"
REP. PENCE:
Down to pre-stimulus, pre-bailout...
"
351,"
MR. GREGORY:
Name the painful choice on a program that you're going to cut.
"
352,"
REP. PENCE:
Look, we could reduce, we could reduce 
government
 employment back down to 
2008
 levels. That's $35 billion over 10. We could eliminate 
government
 programs like the 
Save America's Treasures
 programs.
"
353,"
MR. GREGORY:
That's $.
"
354,"
REP. PENCE:
Talk -- what about entitlement spending? Are you going to raise the retirement age...
"
355,"
MR. GREGORY:
Look...
"
356,"
REP. PENCE:
...as 
John Boehner
 suggests might be a good idea on 
Social Security
?
"
357,"
MR. GREGORY:
Look. Well, you know, in -- the last time I was on this program, I told you we'd keep our promises to seniors and near seniors, but for Americans under the age of 40, we absolutely have to begin to 
reform
Medicare
 and 
Social Security
 in ways that'll ensure its long- term fiscal solvency. But let me assure you, the 
Pledge
 to 
America
 is not the end-all, be-all, it's meant to be a good start.
"
358,"
REP. PENCE:
All right. Congressman 
Van Hollen
, what about 
President Clinton
 who said this week on 
MSNBC
, ""Perhaps the 
Democrats
 need a 
pledge
 of their own. They need a card with three or five of the top points that they're going to 
campaign
 on."" What would those be for 
Democrats
 in the fall and do you take his advice?
"
359,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, the 
Democrats
 have set out what their plans are. We're going to continue as the president has said to focus on providing 
relief
 to 
small business
 going, going 
forward
. We have a bill coming to the floor of the 
House
 this week that I hope 
Mike Pence
 and his colleagues will join us on to try to make sure that we are not put at a competitive disadvantage by the 
Chinese currency
 manipulation. We're going to continue to focus on 
clean energy
 jobs and incentives for 
clean energy
, and we're going to continue to focus on the 
economy
. 
And I
 have to say, when you look at the Republican so-called 
pledge
, you find a lot of phony numbers. Let me give you an example. They say they're going to, they're going to save $16 billion by getting rid of 
TARP
. 
Mike
, we voted to get rid of 
TARP
 already. It was part of the 
Wall Street Reform Bill
 that 
Republicans
 opposed. That bill terminated 
TARP
. And yet, in this 
pledge
, they're pretending that they're going to find savings from shutting down something that we've already shut down. That's the kind of thing I think people are tired of. Earmarks. They've made all this talk about how they were going to end earmarks. We reformed the earmark process. We said no more earmarks that distort the private market by going to for- profit, private entities. There's not a word in there about that. I assume that they're going to go back to their old ways...
"
360,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:
All right.
"
361,"
MR. GREGORY:
...when they quadrupled earmarks.
"
362,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:
We...
"
363,"
MR. GREGORY:

It's hard
 to take seriously, given their record here, and it is the same old, same old.
"
364,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:
I've got...
"
365,"
MR. GREGORY:
Look, different from the 
Democrats
, we 
Republicans
 refuse to request any earmarks this year whatsoever. We've imposed a self-imposed moratorium on earmarks, and we're going to end earmarking as we know it...
"
366,"
REP. PENCE:
OK.
"
367,"
MR. GREGORY:
...if we have a 
chance
 to lead the 
Congress
 again.
"
368,"
REP. PENCE:

Mike
...
"
369,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:
I'm going to leave that, I'm going to leave that part of it done. We have about 
10 seconds
 left. Congressman 
Van Hollen
, you're in charge of getting 
Democrats
 elected in the 
House
. How bad will November be at this point in time in your judgment?
"
370,"
MR. GREGORY:

Democrats
 are going to do very well. We're going to keep the majority because the choice we've talked about here, they said they were listening to the 
American people
. One of the biggest recommendations was to end these perverse 
tax breaks
 that encourage offshoring, outsourcing of 
American jobs
. We've closed down some of those loopholes. We're going to continue to do it. There's not a word about the outsourcing problem in 
America
 in that 
pledge
, not one word in 46 pages.
"
371,"
REP. VAN HOLLEN:
All right.
"
372,"
MR. GREGORY:
Those are the kind of choices people are focusing on in this 
election

MR. GREGORY:
Coming up, we kick off 
NBC
's 
Education Nation
 with an in-depth discussion about our 
nation
's 
public schools
. What are the solutions? How do we get the best 
teachers
 in our classrooms? Right after this brief 
commercial break
.
"
377,"

"
378,"
MR. GREGORY:
And we are back live from 
30 Rockefeller Plaza
 in 
New York
 to kick off 
NBC
's 
Education Nation
. It is our weeklong look into the 
state
 of our 
country
's 
education system
. Joining me now, four key voices in the struggle to improve public K through 12 education, the emergency 
financial manager
 of the 
Detroit public schools
, 
Robert Bobb
; the chancellor of 
Washington
, 
D.C.
, schools, 
Michelle Rhee
; the 
U.S. secretary of Education
, 
Arne Duncan
; and the president of the 
American Federation of Teachers
, 
Randi Weingarten
. Welcome to all of you for such an important topic, an important commitment, I think, by 
NBC News
, as well, to really exploring it this week. And we begin now. What's getting all the buzz right now in the 
reform movement
 is this film, ""
Waiting for
 'Superman,'"" which has debuted this weekend, and I wanted to play just a portion of it that talks about the huge challenge we face, one of the disturbing facts in our 
education system
, as they show in the movie.
"
379,"

"
380,"
MR. GREGORY:
Since the 
1970s
, 
U.S.
 schools have failed to keep pace with the 
rest of the world
. Among 30 
developed countries
, we ranked 25th in math and 21st in science. The 
top 5
 percent of our students, our very best, ranked 23rd out of 29 
developed countries
. In almost every category, we've fallen behind.
"
381,"

"
382,"
Narrator:
And look at a snapshot from our new 
NBC News
/
Wall Street Journal
 poll on the question of education in 
terms
 of the public view of how education is. 
Seventy-seven
 percent in our poll give our 
public schools
 a C grade or lower. And in 
terms
 of the 
state
 of 
public schools
, 58 percent in our poll, if we look at the next screen, 58 percent believe that major changes or complete overhaul is needed. And, indeed, Secretary 
Duncan
, an overhaul is in the works. Where are we right now in 
terms
 of 
reform
?
"
383,"

"
384,"
MR. GREGORY:
We've made tremendous progress. But let me be clear, 
David
, as a 
country
, we have a long, 
long way to go
. We have to educate our way to a better 
economy
. Education is an 
economic strategy
. When you see us being 20th in, you know, math and science, we've fallen in one generation from first to ninth in college graduates. That's unacceptable. And we're paying a terrible price today with a tough 
economy
 because we've lost our way educationally. That's why we're pushing so hard for 
reform
.
"
385,"
SEC'Y ARNE DUNCAN:
It's important to point out, as well, there's a lot of 
money
 in the 
reform movement
 right now. You got most of it. You got billions of 
dollars
 as Education secretary to give as part of 
Race to the Top
. 
President Bush
, who started 
No Child Left Behind
, that will be reauthorized, you hope, certainly. Where are we with those? Because you're giving 
money
, but there's a lot more conditions to really drive 
accountability
.
"
386,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, to be clear, we're not investing in the 
status quo
. So with 
Race to the Top
, which actually represents less than 1, less than 1 percent of total K to 12 spending nationally, you see 
36 states
 raising standards, not dumbing down things, not lying to 
children
 anymore because of 
political pressure
. You see most 
states
 removing barriers to innovative schools. We've seen every single 
state
 eliminate the linking of 
teacher
evaluation
 and 
student achievement
. It's remarkable, remarkable progress encouraged at the local level. 
That's what
 we're investing in, great leadership, great courage at the local level.
"
387,"
SEC'Y DUNCAN:
I, I want to talk throughout this about, not just raising problems, but talking about solutions, because I feel like we dwell on the problems so often it's not always constructive. 
Michelle Rhee
, there's a 
political
 storm in 
Washington
 about education and about the mayor losing his 
primary
, and I'll get to that in just a minute. But I want to start with you and ask you what's working since you've been chancellor? What's the good news?
"
388,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, the good news is what we've shown over the last three and a half years in 
Washington
, 
D.C.
, is that if you prioritize education, if you make it the number one issue in the city, if you have the 
political
 leadership and the courage to make tough decisions, that you can see tremendous progress in a short period of time. Over the last three years we've gone from being, you know, worst, you know, amongst all urban jurisdictions in the 
country
 to actually leading the 
nation
 in gains in our progress of students on the 
NAEP
 examination in both reading and math. So, I think, it basically shows that if you have, if you have a, a, a singular focus and you really are prioritizing, making those tough decisions, that, that progress can, can result.
"
389,"
MS. MICHELLE RHEE:
And, Mr. 
Robb
, what are you finding in 
Detroit
 about what's working right now?
"
390,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, a lot of things that are working in 
Detroit
. I think I'd like to go back to what Secretary 
Duncan
 mentioned, and that is, although our 
state
 did not win in the 
Race to the Top
 competition, considerable reforms were advanced by the governor and the 
state legislature
 and the secretary of -- I mean the, the superintendent of public instructions. And so we are implementing those programs, although we do not have the, the funding in place. In particular, more time spent with, with our 
teachers
 and, and, and, an additional expanded day for our students, and much more rigor that we're putting in our classrooms so that we can, we can compete in the 
21st century
.
"
391,"
MR. ROBERT BOBB:

Randi Weingarten
, I want to go back, all the way back to 
2002
 and 
No Child Left Behind
 and 
President Bush
 and listen again to how he framed what has become the major driver in the 
reform movement
, and that is 
accountability
. Watch this.
"
392,"
MR. GREGORY:
I understand taking tests aren't fun. Too bad. We 
need to know
 in 
America
. We 
need to know
 whether or not 
children
 have got the 
basic education
. No longer is it acceptable to hide poor performance. No longer is it acceptable to keep results away from parents.
"
393,"

"
394,"
PRES. GEORGE W. BUSH:
And 
President Bush
 isn't often given credit for driving 
accountability
 because 
No Child Left Behind
 became unpopular. And yet, indeed, that 
accountability
 is what the 
Obama
administration
 has built on. As -- is 
accountability
, at the core of this, working?
"
395,"

"
396,"
MR. GREGORY:
So, you know, 
President Bush
 was right. Tests aren't fun, but they're absolutely imperative to do. But what happened when 
No Child Left Behind
 was, it all, it became all about the tests as opposed to about teaching and learning. So 
accountability
 is essential as a tool, not as a goal. The goal is, how do help 50 million school 
children
 in the 
United States of America
 get a great education. And so, ultimately, we need to have a couple of other 
tools
 like engaged, robust curriculum, like a real focus on 
teacher
 development, like a real overhauling of the 
teacher
evaluation
system
. And if we look at what the countries that have outcompete -- that outcompete us do, is that there's a huge investment in 
teachers
 as well as looking at 
accountability
. 
Accountability
, absolutely essential; top to bottom 
accountability
 as well as bottom to top. But it's not the whole story.
"
397,"
MS. RANDI WEINGARTEN:
All right, but let's be specific then. 
Michelle Rhee
, in 
Washington
, 
D.C.
, you closed schools, you fired 
teachers
. There was a lot of controversy around that. 
Randi
, if you believe in 
accountability
, what happened in 
Washington
 -- 
Michelle
, you start -- when you did fire 
teachers
 and close down schools that weren't performing?
"
398,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, we certainly got a tremendous amount of pushback. 
And I
 think that Superintendent 
Bobb
 knows this as well. You know, people are uncomfortable when you change what is currently in place. And so what we looked at over the last three and a half years, for example, we closed 23 schools in the first year, we've closed several schools after that because we cannot continue to pour the same amount of 
resources
 into a faulty 
system
. We, we were shrinking in 
terms
 of the number of students that were coming to school every day in 
DCPS
, but we never downsized the number of schools that we had. The result of that is that we were spreading our 
resources
 way too thin and the, the -- we were -- the, the citizens and the students weren't feeling the amount of 
money
 that we were spending every single day. You know, in 
terms
 of the 
teacher
accountability
, yes, we've been -- we've held a very, very 
high bar
. We've said it's no longer going to be acceptable for 
teachers
 who are ineffective to stay in the 
classroom
. And, you know, we've gotten a tremendous amount of pushback about that. 
And I
 think -- I mean, you said we were going to talk about the 
election
. But if you talk about the mayor's 
election
, a lot of what you heard from citizens was, ""Well, they fire 
teachers
."" And what you, unfortunately, didn't hear about that was we didn't fire 
teachers
 to be mean, because were callous or didn't care. We wanted to remove ineffective 
teachers
 from the 
classroom
 simply because we think our 
children
 deserve better.
"
399,"
MS. RHEE:
And you talk about 
accountability
, and yet the 
teachers
 unions, you say they don't -- you shouldn't be demonized, but you just, you sue the 
district
 when, when there is 
accountability
, when 
teachers
 get fired. Is that, is that the constructive response?
"
400,"
MR. GREGORY:
Actually, you know, the last suit that we did was actually about trying to find out the basis upon why -- which some of the 
teachers
 were fired. And, ultimately, we're still waiting to get the 
FOIL
 request and things like that, the 
Freedom of Information
 request. But at the bottom of this, 
David
 and 
Michelle
, we changed the contract to make it more transparent and cohesive, to give 
Michelle
 and the 
district
 more 
tools
 on 
teacher
 quality. We gave the 
teachers
 more 
tools
, we gave the 
district
 more 
tools
. The issue in 
terms
 of us is to make sure that 
teachers
 get the 
tools
 and conditions they need to be 
effective
 and to make sure that there's fairness. We know the 
teacher
 tenure 
system
 is broken, and we want to fix it. There are different ways we fixed it in 
Detroit
, working with the 
district
 there; different ways we fixed it in, in 
Washington
; different ways we fixed it throughout the 
country
. So the issue is how do we make 
teachers
effective
? And also, with all due respect, how do we give the good 
teachers
 -- there's three million 
teachers
 in the 
United States of America
 and 133,300 million. How do we give those quiet, unsung heroes the 
tools
 and conditions they need to help all 
children
?
"
401,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
But with all due respect, let me say that we, you know, in addition to identifying the ineffective 
teachers
 who needed to be terminated, we also identified 16 percent of the 
teachers
 in 
D.C.
 who we rated as highly 
effective
, and we said to them, ""We are going to recognize and reward your work. We're going to compensate you at the level that you deserve to be compensated at."" So, with our new contract now, we will be able to pay the most 
effective
teachers
 who are teaching in high poverty areas and in high need subject areas nearly double the amount that they were previously making. So we are going to use the approach of making sure that the best people are rewarded. But we also have to have the 
flip side
 of that, which is, ""If you are not 
effective
, then you can no longer be in the 
classroom
.""
"
402,"
MS. RHEE:
Secretary 
Duncan
, what happened in 
Washington
, 
D.C.
, that concerns you? Mayor 
Fenty
 did not win for re-
election
 in his 
primary
.
"
403,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
404,"
SEC'Y DUNCAN:
There's a real question -- 
and I
 guess, 
Michelle
, I should ask you, are you going to stay as chancellor of 
D.C.
 schools?
"
405,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, I think that's something that we still have to determine. 
And I
 have to talk to 
Vincent Gray
, who is the, the, the presumptive mayor. But I think the important thing to realize is that 
education reform
 can continue in 
D.C.
, regardless of whether I'm there or not. It can continue as long as the leadership is willing to continue to make the incredibly tough decisions that we've made over the last three years.
"
406,"
MS. RHEE:
It's -- but, Secretary 
Duncan
, this is a 
political question
, but it's germane. You didn't 
campaign
 at all for 
Mary
 -- for 
Adrian Fenty
, the mayor. You said you don't do politics. And yet this past week, you said you would 
campaign
 for congressional 
Democrats
 in the 
midterm election
. Why didn't you 
campaign
 for 
Fenty
 when the blowback against 
teacher
accountability
 can be so severe in some of these local districts?
"
407,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right. Well, I'm, I'm a huge fan of what he and 
Michelle
 have done. By any measure, the 
public schools
 in 
D.C.
 are dramatically better today than when they started. I stood with Mayor 
Fenty
 multiple times. I invested $75 million in the 
district
 because of its leadership. And he can walk out with his head held high. When the story of 
D.C.
's 
school reform
 is written, a huge part is going to be around his courage and his leadership. There are thousands of local primaries around the 
country
, I can't weigh in on every single one. There are 
national
 candidates that I need to support who are going to drive 
school reform
. But Mayor, Mayor 
Fenty
 did, I think, a remarkable job of dramatically improving the quality of education in 
D.C.

"
408,"
SEC'Y DUNCAN:
But let me just stop you. Mr. 
Bobb
, this is one of the issues that, that reformers talk about. You can't denationalize this, this effort. I mean, what happened in 
Washington
, 
D.C.
 -- and the unions were a part of this in 
terms
 of opposing what the mayor and, and 
Michelle Rhee
 did -- if you -- if we make it about individual jurisdictions, the unions are very powerful. Those who, who oppose some of these reforms in the 
status quo
 are powerful. Is it good enough for 
national
 leaders to step back and allow the individual districts to have at it themselves? Can you prevail and 
reform
 when it's this tough? You know what it's like in the 
school district
.
"
409,"
MR. GREGORY:
It's very tough. I think that 
national
 leaders have to be involved and engaged at the local level as well. I mean, the 
reform movement
, what we're doing in 
Detroit
 cannot take place without very strong support from, let's say, 
Governor Granholm
, 
Mike Flanagan
; in 
Michelle
's case, 
Adrian Fenty
. Every major decision that I have made, I have been sued either by local leaders, 
school board
 members. And there is a 
sense
 of urgency in these 
urban school
 districts. You cannot sit back and let 
children
 -- and not take care of what, what's needed for 
children
, particularly more rigor in the classrooms, more 
effective
 leaders -- not just 
teachers
effective
 leaders. I mean, I, I moved 51 principals this year alone. The 
school leadership
 at the building is significantly as important as the 
teachers
 that we put before our 
children
 in the classrooms. I mean, I know that 
Michelle
 went through the process of closing schools in, in 
Washington
, 
D.C. We
 -- in 
2000
, we had 167,000 students in the 
Detroit public schools
. Today we're educating about 84,000, 85,000 students. In the two years that I've been the emergency 
financial manager
, we've closed 59 schools. It is very difficult politically, it's hard on a community, and it's also challenging for parents and students.
"
410,"
MR. BOBB:
All right, and we're going to take a quick break here. We're -- and then we're going to come back and I want to talk specifically about what is really at the core of this debate, which is how do we make sure we get the very best 
teachers
 in front of our students, and how does 
accountability
 achieve that? We'll talk about both sides of that when we're back with our panel right after this brief 
station break
.
"
411,"
MR. GREGORY:
And we're back, live from 
30 Rockefeller Plaza
 in 
New York
, to continue our discussion about 
public school
 education. 
Randi Weingarten
, I want to get to this issue of how we get the best 
teachers
 in front of our students. And let's get right to this point. I'm a parent, I have three young kids. If I go into my child's 
classroom
 and I'm basically told, ""Look, this 
teacher
's really not doing that well, but we want to give them another year, see how they do this year. We want to try to develop them a little bit, so maybe by, you know, maybe not in this year, but maybe next year, things will get better."" That's not good enough for me as a parent.
"
412,"

"
413,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
414,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
So show me -- tell me specifically what you representing 
teachers
 across the 
country
 have done to avoid that reality when it appears that, in fact, the unions have said to people like 
Michelle Rhee
, you can't get rid of these people, you can't just fire them willy-nilly if you don't have the right results. You're demonizing the 
teachers
.
"
415,"
MR. GREGORY:
So that result, when an administrator says that to a parent, is not good for anyone. 
Teachers
 don't want it, parents don't want it. And, ultimately, what we need to do is we need to 
invest
 in 
teachers
 from the moment that they go into 
teacher
 preparation until every single day that they're in a 
classroom
. Most of us -- I don't know, you know, 
Michelle
 has told these stories about when she started to teach, I've told these stories of when I started to teach, I wasn't a very good 
teacher
 my first year. I was a better 
teacher
 my second and third years. So there's going to be some investment lag that happens in 
terms
 of 
teachers
.
"
416,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
But, 
Randi
, we're not talking about a learning curve here. We're not talking about starting out 
teachers
, 
Michelle
. We're talking about 
teachers
 who have been in the 
system
 for a long time...
"
417,"
MR. GREGORY:
Sure.
"
418,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
...who have failed to perform year after year, and yet, frankly, removing them is the hardest part.
"
419,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
420,"
SEC'Y DUNCAN:
So let me, let me just go right to that. No one wants a bad 
teacher
, 
David
. Not 
teachers
, not parents. When I asked our members this question, overwhelmingly they want us to find the 
tools
 and conditions to help 
teachers
 do better. And what we've tried to do now, what we've realized, is that the 
evaluation
system
 is totally and completely broken in the 
United States
. So our 
union
 has tried to 
invest
 in creating a new 
evaluation
system
. There's about 50 or 60 districts that are trying to do that. We've tried to figure out who is good, who is not. If they're not good, we help them. If we can't help them, we have to weed them out of the profession. You're absolutely right...
"
421,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
But is that happening, is my question.
"
422,"
MR. GREGORY:
It is now starting -- you know, it is now starting to happen in the last two years in a greater rate than we've ever seen before.
"
423,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
But I want to give 
Michelle
 a 
chance
 to respond. Is that happening from the- -you've been head of schools, is that how you see it?
"
424,"
MR. GREGORY:
I mean, let's be honest that, first of all, our new 
evaluation
system
 where we actually use 
student achievement
 data, how much a student progresses, to determine whether or not a, a, a 
teacher
 is, is 
effective
 or not, we implemented that because we have the power within the 
district
 to implement whatever 
evaluation
 tool we want. So we, we got a lot of pushback, and we still get, get tremendous pushback from the, from the unions. So, for example, we just identified about 241 educators of this last summer who were, were not 
effective
 or did not have the proper certification, etc. And when we did that and then said, for the ineffective 
teachers
, people who got that on their 
evaluation
, through a robust 
evaluation
, looking at multiple things, ""You are now being terminated,"" then we get slapped with this, you know, huge class-action grievance, basically, saying, you know, ""We're grieving the way that you did this."" But the 
bottom line
 is that if these people are ineffective, and if, as President 
Weingarten
 says, nobody wants ineffective 
teachers
 in the 
classroom
, then you can't fight us every step of the way when we're moving in that direction.
"
425,"
MS. RHEE:
What...
"
426,"
MR. GREGORY:
But, 
David
, we are not...
"
427,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
Well, let me, let me, Secretary 
Duncan
, let's, let's -- what do you see...
"
428,"
MR. GREGORY:
Right.
"
429,"
SEC'Y DUNCAN:
...in the 
sense
 of the overall here? Because this is really the core, isn't this?
"
430,"
MR. GREGORY:

That's right
. It is the core. And let's just take a step back. The 
status quo
 isn't working for 
children
, and it's not working for the 
country
. And what the president fundamentally gets is we have to educate our way to a better 
economy
. 
What do we do
? We have to reward excellence in, in education, we have to reward great 
teachers
, and we have to be much more strategic in how we get great principals and great 
teachers
 to go to historically underserved communities. We have to provide much better support for 
teachers
 who are trying to become 
world class
; and those 
teachers
 where it's simply not working, we have to be much more swift in how we move them out. So it's not working at any levels. It's not working for the stars, it's not working for those in the 
middle
, it's not working for those on the bottom. If it's not working for any adults, it's definitely not working for the 
children
 in this 
country
.
"
431,"
SEC'Y DUNCAN:
Mr. 
Bobb
, this is in part a policy question, in part a 
political question
. As you've looked at, say, what 
Michelle Rhee
 has done in 
Washington
 with Mayor 
Fenty
, how can they better implement 
accountability
 in a way that keeps in mind that there are a lot of 
teachers
, a lot of communities like 
Detroit
, like 
Washington
, 
D.C.
, that rely upon those jobs? We're in a severe 
economic recession
. How do administrators go about 
accountability
 in a way that doesn't create the 
political
 blowback, whether it's lawsuits or whether it's 
political
 blowback at the polls?
"
432,"
MR. GREGORY:
Well, definitely you have to have -- you have to be able to communicate these issues. What it is what you're doing has to be communicated, how you're doing it has to be communicated, and then what processes you're going to put in place to help individuals succeed. And 
those who do not
 succeed, they have to leave the 
system
 immediately.
"
433,"
MR. BOBB:

David
...
"
434,"
SEC'Y DUNCAN:
But, 
David
...
"
435,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
I mean, we just -- 
in Detroit
public schools
, we just -- we have a new 
teacher
 contract. And this year, 
for the first time
, we actually have a new 
teacher
evaluation
system
 that's being put in place.
"
436,"
MR. BOBB:
Mm-hmm.
"
437,"
MR. GREGORY:
We're, we're borrowing from what's being done in 
D.C.
, we're borrowing from what's being done in, in 
Denver
. And those -- we have to have an 
effective
 way in which we can evaluate 
teachers
. But you know what...
"
438,"
MR. BOBB:

David
...
"
439,"
SEC'Y DUNCAN:

David
, let...
"
440,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
...it's not just the 
evaluation
 of 
teachers
.
"
441,"
MR. BOBB:
Right.
"
442,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
OK.
"
443,"
MR. GREGORY:
We have to look at the entire 
system
.
"
444,"
MR. BOBB:
Right.
"
445,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
Right.
"
446,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yes. 
David
...
"
447,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
We have to look from principals to everyone through that whole school.
"
448,"
MR. BOBB:
That...
"
449,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
Secretary 
Duncan
.
"
450,"
MR. GREGORY:
We need dramatic change. Let's, let's be real honest here. What was going on in 
Washington
 for decades was an absolute disgrace for 
children
. What's been going on in 
Detroit
 for far too long is a disgrace. Those 
children
 in both cities had been desperately, desperately underserved. Change is hard. There is going to be blowback. When you challenge the 
status quo
, that is difficult, but we have to have the 
moral courage
 to 
do the right thing
 by our 
children
, and we have to give the 
children
 of 
Detroit
 a 
chance
. 
Detroit
's going in a much better direction, thanks to, to Superintendent 
Bobb
's leadership. 
Washington
's going the right direction. Change is going to continue to be hard. We'll continue to get pushback...
"
451,"
SEC'Y DUNCAN:
And...
"
452,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
...but we have to keep going 
forward
.
"
453,"
SEC'Y DUNCAN:
And so...
"
454,"
MR. GREGORY:
And in most...
"
455,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
Yeah.
"
456,"
MR. GREGORY:
And in both of those places, 
David
, in both of those places, even though it was hard, the 
union
 stepped up and did a contract with 
Robert Bobb
. The 
union
 stepped up and did a contract with 
Michelle Rhee
. The 
union
 sometimes asks to make sure that things are not arbitrary and capricious, but let me ask, let me ask -- say this as well, there are many other districts like the 
ABC District
 in 
Los Angeles
, like the 
New Haven District
, where the 
union
 has stepped up with managers who want to work with us, where we are making that kind of change. So the issue is, for us, about insuring that we do the some -- some of the things that the secretary said, because it's not just about the issue of looking at a snapshot of whether a 
teacher
 is bad or good. It's about developing 
teachers
. It's about not spending the $7 billion that we spend right now...
"
457,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
Right. But let's just...
"
458,"
MR. GREGORY:
...in 
teacher
 turnover. We have to do things that help kids every single day in classrooms, which means investing in 
teachers
 like they do in the countries that outpace us.
"
459,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
All right. Hold on. I want to bring up the 
Colorado
 law about 
evaluation
 of 
teachers
. And really the crux of it is it's a tough law. You supported it.
"
460,"
MR. GREGORY:
Correct.
"
461,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
Of course, you don't represent a lot of 
teachers
 out there, so the 
political
 stakes were not, frankly, as high for you.
"
462,"
MR. GREGORY:
Actually...
"
463,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:
Hold on one a second. That's a reality, because you represent a lot more 
teachers
 in other districts, and we all know that. But what they did there is have tougher evaluations and said, ""After two years, you could be removed."" Do you support that as a 
national
 model?
"
464,"
MR. GREGORY:
We support -- if you help 
teachers
 be the best they can be and evaluate them fairly, then if they have to be removed, they have to be removed. The one thing we want is to not throw the baby out with the bath water. Ultimately, we have to fix the 
due process
system
 to make sure that it's not glacial process. We have to fix the 
evaluation
system
, but more importantly, we have to give 
teachers
 and kids the supports they need so that they can grow, and that's what happens in the countries that out compete us.
"
465,"
MS. WEINGARTEN:

David
...
"
466,"
SEC'Y DUNCAN:
I want to ask one question. Mr. Secretary, you can make your point, too, I want to address what 
Mark Zuckerberg
 has done with 
Facebook
, $000 schools to the 
Newark City schools
. It's tremendous, but what is the role of that 
private money
? Because I've talked to business leaders who say, you know, ""Look, we're only operating on the fringes here, a lot of 
money
. You can't deal with some of the core problems."" And 
money
, as we've talked about, is really not the big issue here.
"
467,"
MR. GREGORY:
Change is the issue.
"
468,"
SEC'Y DUNCAN:
Right.
"
469,"
MR. GREGORY:
And we're seeing whether it's 
Mark
 in 
Silicon Valley
 or the phenomenal movie ""
Waiting for
 'Superman'"" from 
Hollywood
, the 
country
 is starting to take notice. The 
country
. You guys, a couple days summit on education. This has become the 
national
 topic. People know we have to educate our way to a better 
economy
. That 
money
 invested in the 
status quo
 is throwing good 
money
 after bad. That 
money
 to drive fundamental 
change and reform
, just like 
Race to the Top
, it's going to lead the 
country
 where we need to go. So that generosity, that investment from a 
private sector
, it might not seem like a lot of 
money
. Our 
Race to the Top
, $4 billion sounds like a lot. We spend $100 million a year on K to 12 education. Less than 1 percent is changing the 
country
. 
Mark
's 
money
 in 
Newark
, other 
money
 in 
Detroit
, 
Washington
, 
Chicago
, right here in 
New York
, 
L.A.
, that 
private money
, all of us have to 
invest
. The parents, the 
business community
, philanthropy, all of us need to be investing in 
public education
.
"
470,"
SEC'Y DUNCAN:
I've, I've got a minute 30, and, 
Michelle
, I'll come to you first on this. I walked out of the film ""
Waiting for
 'Superman,'"" and my first reaction was as a parent. 
And I
 ask myself, not as the moderator of this program but as a parent, what am I going to do to help? What can the individual who is moved by this do to make some a difference, so we're not just scratching our head and saying, ""Gosh, this is so hard""?
"
471,"
MR. GREGORY:
Yeah. That, I think, is the fundamental question. People have been asking me that, you know, since, since they've been viewing the movie. 
And I
 think what we need, quite frankly, is a 
national movement
 around this, so that people, it doesn't matter if they live in, in 
Idaho
 or 
New York
 or, or 
California
, who want -- who, who are watching the movie and saying, ""This is absolutely wrong. We're doing an injustice to our kids. How can we do better?"" We actually need a 
national movement
 of people, you know, whether it's giving $10 or whether it's 
Mark Zuckerberg
 who's giving $650 billion. I mean, the 
money
 that we got from our external funders really did leverage -- provide us with the leverage that we needed to sign this revolutionary contract. And now it's having reverberations across the 
country
. 
And I
 think that people can't underestimate how much a phone call to a politician, you know, 
dollars
 invested can really help to see some major changing.
"
472,"
MS. RHEE:
All right. We're going to have to leave it there. The other piece of advice I got is, you know, if you drive by a 
public school
, even if your kids don't go there, walk in and ask how you can help, whether you can tutor or provide 
resources
 to a 
teacher
.
"
473,"
MR. GREGORY:
Absolutely.
"
474,"
MS. RHEE:
I think there's a lot we can do just on that baseline level. Thanks to all of you. A conversation that will continue here at 
NBC News
 for the week and around the 
country
 for sure. Thank you all very much. We'll take a break. We'll be right back.
"
475,"
MR. GREGORY:
Programming note before we go. Stay tuned to 
NBC News
 and 
MSNBC
 all week for more on 
Education Nation
. 
Brian Williams
 will moderate a special 
teacher
 town hall today at noon Eastern on 
MSNBC
. Plus, 
President Obama
 sits down with 
Matt Lauer
 on the ""Today"" program tomorrow. And a special 
Web
 extra we want to tell you about on our 
Web site
 today to mark the 50th anniversary of the great debates of 
1960
. We teamed up with the 
University of Virginia
's 
Center
 for Politics to present a special discussion on those historic and first-of-their-kind presidential debates between Vice President 
Richard Nixon
 and then 
Senator John F. Kennedy
, one of which took place in 
NBC's Washington
 studio that is now the home of 
MEET THE PRESS
 when we're actually back at our 
home studio
. We talked to journalists and staffers who were part of history 50 years ago about what happened 
behind the scenes
 and the significance of those debates on our 
political
 landscape today. It's all on our 
Web site
 at mtp.msnbc.com. You can also follow me on 
Twitter
 at 
David Gregory
, as well, for more on that and other topics. That is all for today. We'll be off next week for 
NBC sports
 coverage of the 
Ryder Cup
 golf tournament, but we'll be back the following week. If it's Sunday, it's
