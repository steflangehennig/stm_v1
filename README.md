# Structural Topic Modeling (STM) using R's 'stm' package. 
This notebook introduces structural topic modeling (STM) using _Meet the Press_ transcripts. STMs are unsupervised methods that utilize document-level covariates to explore topics and estimate their relationship to the corpus's associated metadata (Roberts, Stewart and Airoldi 2016).

Included are:
-all transcripts from _Meet the Press_ in 2010
-Jupyter notebook using R
-code that allows for summary statstics, as well as visualization of topics
